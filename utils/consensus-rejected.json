    "text": "On March 1, web hosting provide Linode’s servers were hacked, resulting in a theft of 3000 BTC from Slush and, most severely, 43000 BTC from Bitcoinica. There have been two major Bitcoin heists before, one 25000 BTC theft in June and a 17000 BTC theft from the Bitcoin exchange bitomat.pl in August, resulting in the exchange being bailed out and acquired by MtGox. Security is a major issue in the Bitcoin community, and many are worried that if they want to carry out a significant portion of their economic activity in bitcoins their money will not be safe. Many traditional banking proponents see the theft in June and now this heist as clear indications of the inferiority of Bitcoin’s lack of reversibility and an effective audit trail, and it cannot be denied that incidents such as these do shake even Bitcoin proponents’ confidence in the system, but it is critically important that we do not fall into hysteria and exaggerate the consequences and instead approach the issue with a cool head. There are several reasons why this theft is in fact less consequential to the Bitcoin community than it might seem at first glance.Bitcoin’s security has gotten better between this theft and the one that happened six months ago, and will only continue to get better in the future. When bitomat.pl was hacked, the 17,000 of their Bitcoins that they lost represented all of their clients’ money, and MyBitcoin’s losses were equal to 51% of their total funds. Bitcoinica’s losses, though staggering to the average individual, were mild enough that they were able to reimburse all of their customers and continue running. They are upgrading their security following this incident and are working on a more secure, specialized server. Soon, innovations like multi-signature transactions will enter mainstream usage and increase security even more.Storing $220,000 worth of data is not something unique to Bitcoin. Businesses like Sony and Stratfor had to suffer much worse as their proprietary data was leaked by Anonymous, and there are many low-profile cases that do not make the news. A report by the Ponemon institute shows that the average cost of a stolen laptop is $49,246, including $39,297 due to lost or leaked data. We only pay so much attention to Bitcoin-related losses because the value is so clearly quantified and because Bitcoin business remains extremely open and community-oriented — normally, banks do not announce their robberies to the public because they do not want to be perceived as vulnerable and take a hit to their reputation.Bitcoinica is a financial services business and they have to deal with these kinds of risks in ways other businesses do not. It’s worth keeping in mind that such risks are not unique to Bitcoin — MF Global saw $1.2 billion, or roughly 100% of what was then its net worth (the derivatives broker has since collapsed), simply disappear without a trace. Bitcoinica, on the other hand, managed to remain solvent. For the average Bitcoin-handling business, such risks are much milder as all of their Bitcoins can be stored in cold storage as they simply need to accept money coming in all the time, not take it out.The little guy is secure. Bitcoinica has taken the entire 43000 BTC hit and the balances of individual Bitcoin users remain untouched. The ironic thing is, this is exactly how things work for the consumer in the real world. When your credit card gets stolen and the thief buys $10000 worth of goods with it, the bank refunds your losses and your balance remains untouched, just as happened here (although the consequences to the merchant who sold the goods are somewhat less pleasant). This is one of the key points of Bitcoin: Bitcoin does not force you to be your own bank. You can keep your bitcoins stored with a Bitcoin bank if that makes you feel safer, and as more and more average users begin to accept Bitcoin such services will begin to appear. There are already various options with as many levels of convenience and paranoia as there are types of smartphones. Freedom is superior to non-freedom not because people always prefer it no matter what the consequences, but because it allows the expression of a preference in the first place.",

    "text": "The question of how to store your bitcoins is one of the most important decisions for a Bitcoin user to make, and that is why we have done an extremely thorough Bitcoin wallet review for all major Bitcoin wallets.In this article we will perform bitcoin wallet reviews, including providing the current best option, by looking at ease of use, security and advanced features for the major wallets in each category: Online Bitcoin Wallets, Desktop Bitcoin Wallets and Mobile Bitcoin Wallets.To save you some time our conclusion to maximize ease of use, security and advanced features is to use the most well rounded Blockchain.info mobile bitcoin wallet (Android or Apple Store) coupled with the ultra-secure and advanced desktop bitcoin client Armory.Regardless of what kind of electronic payment system you are using if you want to spend digital money then you need to have a digital wallet. Bitcoin differs from every other online payment system. Bitcoin has no central provider and anyone can build a bitcoin wallet. Consequently, there are several dozen bitcoin wallets to choose from and they all vary in terms of ease of use, security and advanced features which makes it important to carefully consider these bitcoin wallet reviews.DIGITAL WALLETSThe Bitcoin wallets come in many different varieties often with trade-offs between ease of use, security and advanced features. Some are websites that simply offer the basic functions of sending and receiving bitcoins and attempt to make these functions as easy to use as possible. Others are fully-featured online bitcoin wallets that offer the user more power and control including advanced options such as custom transactions.Then there are bitcoin wallets that are desktop applications which tend to be more difficult to setup but offer higher security and more advanced features across the board. And digital wallets would be incomplete without a mobile strategy and there are plenty of mobile Bitcoin wallets targeted at this huge market.The list of options to choose from is daunting but we have done the hard work of narrowing the list from dozens to a few in this Bitcoin wallet review. First, ask yourself the question: Do I want a client I can download to my own computer, an online wallet interface, or a client for my smartphone? If you are an avid Bitcoin user then you may wish to have two of the above or even all three. It is extremely popular to have an easy-to-use, medium-security, online and smartphone bitcoin wallet for spending and a highly secure desktop Bitcoin wallet for savings and advanced features.Once you have narrowed down your use case then look at the options available within each category. Do you want a client that offers more powerful features or do you want something that is easy to use? Perhaps you paranoid and want extra security? In all three of the categories there are different bitcoin clients to suit various needs.Online Bitcoin Wallet ReviewsOnline wallets are the easiest to setup and offer extreme convenience of being able to access your bitcoins from any computer. But generally there is a cost of requiring a higher degree of trust in the provider. Three well known options to choose from among online Bitcoin wallets include:Blockchain.infoTHE BREAKDOWNEase of use: 3/5 Security: 3.5/5 Advanced features: 4/5TOTAL: 10.5/15Blockchain is a hybrid between an online wallet and a desktop client and seeks to offer close to desktop-level security with the convenience of an online application. Unlike the alternatives, Blockchain works by storing your wallet encrypted, and running the code necessary to decrypt your wallet and sign transactions in your browser, so the operators of Blockchain have no way to access your funds.However, there are some security complications with relying solely on Javascript cryptography, so users who want to take full advantage of the increased security that Blockchain has to offer should install either the Chrome or Firefox extension or the  wallet verifier addon for Safari.The client also offers a number of advanced options: the ability to download and backup your wallet to your computer or a printed sheet of paper, private key import and export, brain wallet support and an offline transaction mode are all available.CoinbaseTHE BREAKDOWN Ease of use: 3.5/5 Security: 3.5/5 Advanced features: 1/5TOTAL 8/15Coinbase is a step up from Instawallet in terms of both complexity and security. But it is still basic with only standard sending and receiving functionality. Nevertheless, Coinbase has two features which make it a very convenient wallet for the beginning user.First, the wallet allows you to avoid dealing with Bitcoin addresses entirely and instead send directly to an email address. This makes the transfer internally if both parties have a Coinbase account and if the receiver does not then it sends an email message to the recipient instructing them to immediately create an account to receive the bitcoin payment.Second, Coinbase includes its own built-in bitcoin exchange which empowers users to convert between bitcoins and US dollars directly through their bank accounts using ACH and they have processed tens of millions of dollars worth of orders. Unfortunately, the bank account integration is only available with banks inside the United States and only a limited amount can be bought or sold at a time depending on verification and other Coinbase policies.Third, there is a Coinbase Android app. Many wallets are cross-platform compatible.Coinbase does not claim to be trust-free and all bitcoins are stored in a centralized location controlled by its operators. This means you do not have absolute control over your bitcoins and there have been technical incidents which have left users without wallet functionality, unconfirmed transactions and may have comprised data or personal information. But so far no customer funds have been lost and these appear merely as growing pains for this new startup.Nevertheless, Coinbase raised $5m of venture capital funding and will likely be around the Bitcoin ecosystem for the foreseeable future and the founder and venture capital investors are unlikely to betray their users by absconding with bitcoins. Their current corporate policy of storing 85% of users' funds in offline cold storage means that the bitcoins are likely well-protected against third-party theft.WalletBitTHE BREAKDOWNEase of use: 3/5 Security: 2.5/5 Advanced features: 1/5TOTAL: 6.5/15Like Coinbase, WalletBit attempts to create an online wallet that is easy to use but has all of the convenience features that beginning users need. WalletBit allows sending to email addresses as well as a built-in conversion to and from the user's local currency through the Bitcoin exchanges Bitcoin Nordic and MtGox.These options are less convenient than Coinbases bank account integration with ACH but they have much higher deposit and withdraw limits and are more widely available around the world. WalletBit is also a merchant services provider. If you are interested in accepting bitcoins for your business, whether online or brick-and-mortar, then WalletBit has a wide variety of integrated supplementary tools to assist you.WalletBit's security model is similar to that of Coinbase but their operators are neither more established and prominent than Coinbase's nor have they raised the same amount of venture capital. So you should consider the staying power of the developers in the bitcoin wallet reviews.Desktop Bitcoin Wallet ReviewsDesktop clients are simply software programs that you download onto your computer. They offer increased security and control but at the expense of being more difficult to set up. Hence the trade-off in these bitcoin wallet reviews. There are three main clients to choose from:ArmoryTHE BREAKDOWNEase of use: 2/5 Security: 5/5 Advanced features: 5/5TOTAL: 12/15Armory is the most advanced and secure Bitcoin client available and has been developed by Alan Reiner who is one of the world's premier experts in Bitcoin security. If your use case requires safely storing large value in bitcoins then Armory is the only practical choice.Armory offers a range of features even larger than either Blockchain.info or the Satoshi Bitcoin client. However, all of these tremendous benefits come at a price: convenience. There are three modes a user can choose: Standard, Advanced and Expert. But even the Standard mode requires some serious study to become competent.Of course, there is standard bitcoin wallet functionality like storing encrypted wallets, managing an address book, changing or removing a passphrase, backing up either individual private keys or via paper or digital methods, deleting or removing wallets and creating watching-only addresses.However, beyond the standard functionality expected from any Bitcoin wallet client, Armory pays attention to small details like having a graphical keyboard to protect against keyloggers and other features empower users to manage multiple wallets, import or sweep private keys, sign messages (although this functionality is not compatible with the Satoshi client), perform your own elliptic curve calculations using secp256k1 elliptic curve to supply values as 32-byte, big-endian, hex-encoded integers and most importantly Armory has seamless integration for signing transactions completely offline.This offline transaction signing can greatly reduce potential attack vectors and there is no other wallet which offers this type of security in as easy to use implementation. This feature should not be underestimated!The Armory client has no networking functionality and requires the Satoshi client to be running at the same time to interact with the blockchain. This can put strain on an older computer and even with the latest hardware there is significant startup time because it uses the Satoshi Bitcoin client for transaction data and therefore needs to download the entire blockchain.But this is the only major downside we could find in this particular bitcoin wallet review of the Armory client. And if your use case requires storing significant amounts of bitcoins that you do not want compromised then the Armory client is the best choice.BitcoinQtTHE BREAKDOWNEase of use: 2/5 Security: 4/5 Advanced features: 3/5TOTAL: 9/15Originally developed by Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008-2009, and continuously worked on by the core Bitcoin development team since then, this is the first Bitcoin client ever created. The client is a fully fledged node of the Bitcoin network, meaning that it can connect to other nodes and help verify and relay transactions, although it cannot mine.Because it is a full node, the client must download the entire (currently 6 gigabyte) blockchain to operate, which can take up to a few days the first time you start the client and several minutes to an hour every time you start the client afterward if you do not keep it running constantly. Your private keys, the mathematical data that makes it possible for you to spend the bitcoins that have been sent to one of your Bitcoin addresses, are stored in a \"wallet.dat\" file on your computer (which users are encouraged to back up), and the client offers the option of keeping your wallet.dat encrypted.This client is arguably the most trustworthy, since its development is certainly the most heavily scrutinized and is overseen by very well-known and established members of the Bitcoin community. So the probability of it having security holes is pretty low and one reason for it being so popular in the bitcoin wallet reviews.Its features include the basic sending and receiving functionality, as well as a feature that allows you to digitally sign a message with one of your addresses, allowing anyone who knows that the address belongs to you to verify that the message was not modified or forged (the verification functionality is also present in the client).ElectrumTHE BREAKDOWNEase of use: 3.5/5 Security: 3.5/5 Advanced features: 3.5/5TOTAL: 10.5/15Electrum is a solid lightweight desktop client, meaning that it does not download the full blockchain. Instead, it relies on servers to do much of the work. It performs well in the bitcoin wallet review because it empowers you to send and receive transactions, but also has some advanced features: it can generate wallets deterministically from a seed, create and sign transactions offline, sign and verify messages (compatibly with the Satoshi client's implementation), export a 'root public key' that allows applications like AcceptBit to monitor, but not spend from, the wallet, and it can import and export private keys.Unfortunately, these advanced features are only accessible through the command line. Those who only wish to send and receive bitcoins, however, need not worry about the advanced features. If one wishes just to send and receive bitcoins, Electrum offers the most simple, easy-to-use and minimalistic interface of all the online and desktop wallets.MultibitTHE BREAKDOWNEase of use: 3/5 Security: 3.5/5 Advanced features: 3/5TOTAL: 9.5/15Like Electrum, Multibit is a lightweight client, although it is perhaps one step below Electrum in the regard. Unlike Electrum, Multibit does not need to rely on servers; instead, it connects directly to the network, using a new feature known as bloom filters implemented in BitcoinQt 0.8 to only download a small subset of the Bitcoin blockchain, and thus avoid the 6 GB download that the Satoshi client and Armory require, while still keeping track of all transactions that are relevant to the user. MultiBit is also known for having translations into dozens of languages worldwide, as well as having the ability to manage multiple wallets.Mobile Bitcoin Wallet ReviewsMobile Bitcoin wallets are specifically targeted for mobile phones and offer a different array of features to consider in the bitcoin wallet reviews. Advanced private key importing and message signing functionality is out, but features such as the ability to create payment requests in the form of QR codes, and scan such requests made by others, are included in all the options, making sending and receiving bitcoins on a smartphone much easier. Note that this page describes wallets for Android only, as Apple does not allow Bitcoin applications on its platform to offer sending and receiving features.Blockchain.infoTHE BREAKDOWNEase of use: 3/5 Security: 3/5 Advanced features: 2/5TOTAL: 8/15Blockchain's mobile wallet is similar to its desktop wallet in operation, but it only offers the simplified interface of receiving and sending bitcoins, as well as the standard mobile QR code functionality including importing of private keys. The mobile wallet and the desktop wallet can be made to point to the same account. This empowers you you to spend your bitcoins anywhere.Just like in the browser wallet, transaction signing is done client-side, so Blockchain themselves never gain access to your wallet. Like the other major mobile wallets, it does offer the ability to set a PIN for security, but the feature is hard to find it requires adding a second password from within Blockchain's desktop browser interface, which will then be required on both your smartphone and your desktop.Bitcoin SpinnerTHE BREAKDOWNEase of use: 3/5 Security: 3/5 Advanced features: 2/5TOTAL: 8/15Bitcoin Spinner differs from many of its alternatives in that it does everything client-side; transactions are signed and received locally on your phone, and your private keys are never sent over the internet, even in an encrypted form. Spinner does rely on a server to function, but its role is limited to simply relaying transaction data and it has no way to gain access to your wallet.However, with greater power comes responsibility. If you forget to back up your private key and your phone breaks or is lost, your funds are gone forever. Fortunately, Spinner does make the backup process fairly easy; all you need to do is go to Settings-> Backup Wallet in the menu and you will be able to QR scan the key or copy it to your clipboard.Andreas Schildbach's Bitcoin WalletTHE BREAKDOWNEase of use: 1/5 Security: 3.5/5 Advanced features: 2/5TOTAL: 6.5/15The original Bitcoin wallet for smartphones and written using Mike Hearn's BitcoinJ Java library. It is by far the most independent of all mobile wallets, requiring no third parties whatsoever to continue functioning; the client connects to the Bitcoin network directly and stores a small portion of the blockchain locally to verify incoming transactions.Like Bitcoin Spinner, however, it does require the user to take care to manage their own backups. Until very recently, the wallet was very slow and data-hungry due to its need to process the entire blockchain, but its latest version and the advent of BitcoinQt 0.8 means that it can now download transactions much more quickly which is positive for the bitcoin wallet review.",

    "text": "Bitcoin is a new kind of digital currency originally created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Of course, the idea of digital money is not new; for many years now we have had Paypal, credit cards, WebMoney dollars and even the virtual gold in video games like World of Warcraft. What makes Bitcoin different from anything that came before it, however, is that Bitcoin exists only on the internet, and is not dependent on any government or corporation. Instead, the Bitcoin system is collectively maintained by thousands of computers owned by various individuals around the world. Because of this, Bitcoin is able to offer a number of advantages over other methods of digital payment:1. Bitcoin has very low fees. Technically, you do not need to pay any fees at all, although if you do not include a small fee of about 0.0001 BTC (~$0.01) transactions below 0.01 BTC (~$1) will be processed more slowly.2. Your Bitcoin wallet cannot be frozen or seized. Some kinds of organizations – particularly political organizations, must frequently deal with Paypal or credit card companies refusing to process payments for them and even freezing their account, leaving their owners to maintain them out of pocket. With Bitcoin, there is no way for anyone to block or reverse transactions.3. You have increased privacy with Bitcoin. Although all transactions between Bitcoin addresses are public, you do not have to tell anyone which Bitcoin addresses belong to you (to further increase privacy, most Bitcoin wallets give you a new address every time you receive money), making it very difficult for anyone to link you with your transactions.4. Bitcoin transfers are nearly instant. When someone sends you bitcoins, you will see the transaction within five seconds, and it will usually be “confirmed” by the network within ten minutes. Accepting transactions without confirmations is sufficiently low-risk for nearly all applications, so many merchants will accept your payment immediately.5. Bitcoin is international. Paypal is unusable in 60 countries around the world, and international payments often charge hefty fees, but with Bitcoin sending money from Kyrgyzstan to Guatemala is exactly as easy, quick and cheap as sending money to your own neighbor.Essentially, Bitcoin does to finance what email did to our communications.Bitcoin WalletsIn order to use Bitcoin, you need to have a Bitcoin wallet. The purpose of a Bitcoin wallet is, as the name implies, to let you receive, store and send bitcoins. To receive bitcoins, you need to have a Bitcoin address; this is a series of numbers and letters like “1McqmmnxRwZRCpD2VoGEMzCYcdeXYvCBsB” that is essentially the equivalent of a bank account number – you give your Bitcoin address out to people so that they can send you money. Your wallet will generate Bitcoin addresses for you. When you want to send money, your Bitcoin wallet will have a form where you can paste in the Bitcoin address you want to send to, enter the amount, and hit “Send”. It’s just like email or a bank account; if you just want to use Bitcoin to send and receive money that’s all there is to it.Bitcoin wallets can be desktop programs, smartphone apps (Android only so far unfortunately; blame Apple’s policies) or websites. Here is a page listing the more popular ones.Transactions: the Technical DescriptionThere are three numbers connected to each Bitcoin address:1. The private key. This is needed to sign transactions (more on this below).2. The public key. This can be derived from the private key, and can be used to verify that a signature made with the associated private key is legitimate, without actually knowing the private key.3. The Bitcoin addreess itself. This is the hash (a mathematical one-way compressing function) of the public key.Here is one example of such a triple:·Private key: c4bbcb1fbec99d65bf59d85c8cb62ee2db963f0fe106f483d9afa73bd4e39a8a·Public key: 0478d430274f8c5ec1321338151e9f27f4c676a008bdf8638d07c0b6be9ab35c71a1518063243acd4dfe96b66e3f2ec8013c8e072cd09b3834a19f81f659cc3455·Address: 1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1TIn order to send money to someone, you (or rather, your Bitcoin wallet) must create a file called a Bitcoin transaction and publish it to the network. A Bitcoin transaction contains five basic parts: (1) the previous transaction that originally gave you the money that you are trying to spend, (2) the public key associated with the Bitcoin address that the previous transaction was sending money to (ie. your address), (3) the destination Bitcoin address that you are sending to, (4) the amount to send and (5) a digital signature of the rest of the transaction signed by the private key associated with the same address whose public key you included. To verify that a transaction is legitimate, the Bitcoin network does the following:1. Check the signature to make sure that (i) the transaction was signed by the private key connected with the public key included in the transaction and (ii) the transaction was not tampered with.2. Check that the public key included in the transaction matches the receiving address of the previous transaction.If you know (1) and (2), you know that the transaction was signed by the owner of the private key connected to the receiving address, and so they are entitled to spend the money. Every “full node” in the Bitcoin network makes this calculation, and if everything checks out the transaction is accepted.MiningMining is the other important part of Bitcoin’s underlying cryptographic mechanism. The transaction system solves one major problem of security: it ensures that no one can spend other people’s money, either by making transactions themselves or by modifying other transactions in transit. However, there is still another attack that the transaction system by itself does not solve: the double spending attack. The attack works like this:1. Alice sends 10 BTC to Bob, and publishes the transaction.2. Alice waits for Bob to give her some product (in order to be effective, it must be some instant-transfer digital good, like a one-time code or another cryptocurrency)3. Alice makes a transaction sending the exact same 10 bitcoins to herself, and publishes that transaction. She then floods the network with this second transaction with thousands of computers, hoping that the majority of computers will accept her transaction (thus nullifying the conflicting transaction to Bob) even if Bob’s came first.The naive way to resolve this is by saying that the first transaction always wins. However, the problem is that this can easily fragment the network; for example, evil Eve might send a 10 BTC transaction to Alice to one half of the network and a 10 BTC transaction to Bob to the other half, and then watch in glee as Alice and Bob make further transactions and the Bitcoin network splits in half over the disagreement. To ensure consensus, Bitcoin uses the mechanism that is known as mining.Roughly every ten minutes, Bitcoin transactions are gathered together and published in what is called a “block”. A block has certain mathematical properties that make it very hard to create – so hard, in fact, that it takes the entire Bitcoin network an average of ten minutes to create one (the difficulty of the mathematical property in question is deliberately adjusted to ensure this). The only algorithm for making blocks is basically to change around insignificant details in the block until the mathematical property checks out. This is what Bitcoin miners do – they keep on trying different values until eventually one gets lucky, creates a valid block, and the process continues from there. Note that each block also contains a pointer (technically, a hash) to the previous block, so if someone tries to change one block in the middle then the next block will need to also be re-created (there are no shortcuts here; this is just as hard as creating that block was originally), and from there the block after that will also need to be re-created, and so on. Now, what happens if Alice wants to carry out her attack?1. Alice sends 10 BTC to Bob, and publishes the transaction.2. Bob, being a particularly security-conscious merchant, waits for three confirmations, and sends off the good. This means that he waits until his transaction was put into a block and then two further blocks were published after it.3. Alice sends 10 BTC to herself. This transaction will not be accepted by the network, because a conflicting transaction was already made three blocks ago. She cannot simply modify a block in the middle, because of how the blocks are linked to each other. Thus, her only choice is to replace every single block after the one that she wishes to change.4. Even though Alice spent $100,000 on Bitcoin mining hardware, she still has a hundred times less computing power than the rest of the Bitcoin network put together. Thus, in the time that she creates the three blocks needed to catch up, the rest of the network will already be three hundred blocks ahead. Once Alice catches up to there, the rest of the network will be thirty thousand blocks ahead, and so on.Thus, Alice’s situation is hopeless. The only way she could possibly catch up to the rest of the network is if she had more computing power than the rest of the network combined – perhaps the weakest security assumption in the entire Bitcoin system, but nevertheless a very daunting task. To date, no one has managed to do such a thing and it is getting harder for an outside attacker to pull this off every month. Since the more legitimate miners there are, the harder this gets, the Bitcoin network incentivizes mining by giving every miner that creates a block 25 BTC plus all transaction fees (about 0.25 BTC per block right now).Should I Mine?Probably not. Mining these days is done by computers with specialized chips known as ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), which are hundreds of times more efficient than the average CPU. If you have a computer with a powerful graphics card, you may or may not be able to profitably mine with your GPU; you may want to check your local electricity costs, get a Kill-A-Watt to measure your electricity usage and try it out for yourself. You may also wish to consider mining Litecoin instead; there are currently no Litecoin ASICs (and when they do come out they will have less of a speed advantage), so the situation is stacked somewhat more in your favor. If you wish to own bitcoins, it is probably a better idea to buy or earn them instead.",

    "text": "NSFW-Disclaimer: some all of the links in this article might contain material not suitable for viewing in a workplace environment. If you don’t want to look at porn, don’t click any links.Girls Gone WildTo enjoy this little story that has developed over the last few days, one should probably first understand a reddit subcommunity called “/r/gonewild”. If you’re so inclined, take a look: [NSFW] /r/gonewild. The description reads:Gonewild is a place for open-minded Adult Redditors to exchange their nude bodies for karma; showing it off in a comfortable environment without pressure.The basic action the boys can take in this subreddit is to give the girl some love in the form of upvotes (reddit karma) and positive comments. As for the motivation of the girls, let us quote LadyBytes, whom we interviewed for this story: “I have posted, just once before. I did it because I felt beautiful, and I wanted to explore my sexuality in a new way.”Girls Gone BitcoinIntrigued by this, a group of Bitcoiners following the reddit subcommunity suggested the idea of giving some additional love to the girls in the form of Bitcoin tips. This could be done by simply having them overlay a Bitcoin address on the pictures they post. It is up to the reader to judge for himself whether or not it was the intention to provide an additional incentive to reveal a little more in the photos.Given the historically poor reception of Bitcoin in the general reddit crowd, it was decided that a new separate sub-community would need to be established. And thus, the subreddit [NSFW] /r/girlsgonebitcoin was born. The description reads:“Girls Gone Bitcoin is a place for open-minded Adult Women to exchange their sexy photos for Bitcoin and Karma. If you don’t know, Bitcoin is a virtual currency that can be exchanged for just about any fiat currency like Dollars, Yen, or Euro.”A bounty (the typical term used in the Bitcoin community to describe a reward for completion of a task) was collectively offered by various Bitcoiners in the community; half towards making a tutorial for the sub-community to follow, and half towards the first ten girls to post at least partially nude pictures featuring a Bitcoin address in the form of a FirstBits address or QR-code.The first half of the bounty was quickly claimed by the aforementioned redditor. She published a simple tutorial on how to receive bitcoins that is also rewarding to look at in other ways ([NSFW] Video, [NSFW] step by step instructions). As for LadyBytes’ (that is her handle on reddit) motivation to do this, let’s hear her own words again: “I was turned on by the idea of creating a video that would teach women (especially women) a little bit about Bitcoin, and how to use a new currency to their advantage. Also, I’ve never had the chance to make a video before…I thought maybe I’d be good at it. The video I posted was my first take, and I even surprised myself I also saw the potential for employment. Work anonymously…no taxes, no work visa? Yes please…”The Show must go onBy word of mouth the message started to get around about how Bitcoin could make what these girls were already doing much more exciting, and a few girls began to wander their way in from their previous stomping grounds of /r/gonewild. Despite the obvious taboos and learning curve involved, it has worked out quite well. At the time of writing totaling an equivalent of USD 424.27 in Bitcoins shared among 9 redditors.Unfortunately our front-girls money got snatched by a thief. She had used an online wallet service that puts the full credentials into the wallet access url, no additional password. She had masked out the URL-bar, but had unfortunately forgotten about the “Welcome to your Wallet” box on the site which also shows that URL ([NSFW] compromizing picture). The thief must’ve managed to read that and stole almost all the coins. LadyBytes: “pride and confidence momentarily waivered”.Conclusion and OutlookLadyBytes wraps it up nicely: “I think the hate is derived from confusion and lack of knowledge. A lot of people don’t know what Bitcoin is. My response to them: Get used to it, this is the future of porn.”She also shared her more general view on Bitcoin with us: “On a broader note, I fully support Bitcoin as the decentralized anonymous currency that it is meant to be. I think we humans should be able to monetarily support whomever we want, whatever activist groups we want, regardless of any government opinion or non-consensus among peers. I believe the power of Bitcoin goes far beyond nude photos and illicit substances.”",

    "text": "While the Bitcoin community has been quick to replicate many industries found in the real world, so far one has been rather lacking: business-to-business services. Bitcoin venture capital has existed in some form for a long time now with various GLBSE-based assets like the (now defunct) LIF-A fund and, more recently, muBit as well as the more professional Islamic Bank of Bitcoin, and many Bitcoin businesses rely on BitPay for their payment processing, but outside of the financial industry business-to-business services have been rather lacking, with only a few abortive attempts in 2011 that even most hardcore Bitcoin users have never even heard of. Helpcoin.com seeks to change this. The site seeks to do for B2B what Bitmit is doing for auctions and Coindl is seeking to do for digital downloads: do what has already been done before, but do it right.The site offers support in three areas: consulting, support and marketing. \"A lot of sites have attempted to create their own support teams,\" the site's front page explains, \"but end up getting discouraged because of the high overhead.\" When the Bitcoin community was much smaller than it is now, marketing was not a problem as two forum posts would reach almost everyone. More recently, however, as the Bitcoin forum sees 1500 posts a day establishing a brand name in such a vast swamp is much more difficult, and the barriers to entry have been raised considerably due to the competition. The issue of support has also undone many; it's no longer feasible to see and reply to every forum post as it once was, and in the Bitcoin community a business with inadequate support leads to quick associations with MyBitcoin and scams. As HelpCoin's own website states, \"the best form of marketing is customer support.\" The need for a Bitcoin business to offer professional service and professional support has never been greater, and will only continue to rise, and to that end Helpcoin offers a compelling solution: leave it to the experts.The business is so far only starting, and as of April 8 its team of experts is only one in number: Stefan Thomas. Nevertheless, his credentials are more than adequate. He is the developer of bitcoinjs, a Javascript Bitcoin library, and WebCoin, a Bitcoin wallet based on bitcoinjs, created WeUseCoins, the famous Bitcoin introductory site and spoke at the Bitcoin Conference in Prague in November. It already boasts two clients: WeUseCoins itself, which uses HelpCoin's live help project, and Coinabul, the Bitcoin gold and silver selling site. As for what happens beyond that, their success or failure hinges on one key factor: as a business that sells not a clear, fungible product for a fixed price but a vaguely defined service where their customers have no idea what to expect, can they create a service that matches the Bitcoin business community's needs and can they convince the Bitcoin community to give them a chance? In short, this budding crew of marketing experts' greatest challenge will be to market themselves.",

    "text": "Of all the formalized monetary systems that have ever been used by mankind, Bitcoin is unique in the fact that it exists entirely as pure information. The blockchain, the database storing Bitcoin transactions so the system can figure out who owns what, it stored simultaneously on tens of thousands of computers and servers around the world. The system’s equivalent of “accounts”, Bitcoin addresses, are also really nothing more than 160-bit numbers, and the private keys that allow withdrawal access are 256-bit numbers themselves. The result of this is that we can literally store our money in whatever way we want, and people have picked up on this: we have QR code wallets, paper wallets, coins with private keys hidden behind a hologram, etc. However, the most interesting of all the alternatives is the place where humans have been storing most of our information for the past 100,000 years: in our brains.A “wallet” is a collection of two types of numbers: addresses, typically rendered as 33 or 34-character strings like 13ignD31FysQbaBBVJUzffcQoFxxEuEcbE that allow deposit access to the address’s associated account and private keys, slightly longer numbers that allow withdrawal access. Technically, you do not need to remember your address as you can always derive it from the private key, but it is better to as you do not want to be typing in your private key all over the place. Thus, the simplest wallet that can be memorized is just one address and one private key.The major insight that gives us all the various different options to help us remember an address and private key is that addresses and private keys are ultimately not strings of digits and letters – they are numbers. A number is a mathematical entity that we can choose to represent in our traditional base 10 (called “base 10″ because it relies on ten symbols to represent all of our numbers: 0123456789) as, for example, “3022885”, in base 16 (“2E2025″), in base 2 or binary (“1011100010000000100101″), as a product of prime numbers (5 * 89 * 6793), in base 58 (“GVbi”) or in any other way that we see fit. Bitcoin uses base 58 because it is a reasonable compromise between brevity and readability – lower bases are longer since you can pack less information into each symbol, but upgrading to a higher base like 60 would introduce distinctions between the letter O and the number 0 and capital I and lowercase l and thus potentially lead to mistakes. You can memorize an address or private key in any base you see fit, provided that you have a base converter to bring it back to base 58 when the time comes to give out your address or use your private key.Base 58 is the easiest option, and will have you memorizing a fairly reasonable 51 characters for the private key and 34 more for the address, although if you do not want to memorize the address you can also just memorize the first few characters and let firstbits.com retrieve the rest for you (paste the address into firstbits to find out just how much you need to memorize; usually it’s 6 characters). Note that firstbits recovers the address by searching for the chronologically first matching address in the blockchain, so you will need to have sent a transaction to the address, but the upside of firstbits’ algorithm is that your firstbits abbreviation will be valid forever. In terms of raw information content (or, as information theorists refer to it, entropy), the simpler solution is equivalent to memorizing fourteen 7-digit phone numbers, something which those of us who have not yet been drawn in by the seductive allure of storing everything on our smartphones have likely aready done anyway. The full solution of memorizing all 51+34 brings that up to 21 phone numbers. However, the nature of base 58 makes this job considerably easier for us as the presence of letters and numbers triggers auditory and visual memory at the same time, and the pronounceable letter combinations, short words and acronyms that sometimes pop up trigger a mental phenomenon known as clustering where we remember multiple symbols as one unit – think of how you remember “Smith”, not “S…M…I…is that D or T again…H”.Smaller bases are more difficult to use because of how many characters you will need to memorize, but if you prefer a mix of more numbers and some letters base 16 is a reasonable option, and it has the advantage that private keys can be imported from that format automatically just as easily as base58 keys. Another possibility is, interestingly enough, base 1751, using not letters as digits but words. Grondilu’s Bitcoin Bash Tools convert back and forth for you automatically, giving you a string of words like this:THE BLOT SET TWIT BARE LEER WAGE LILT LIND CORK GOAL OFT REAR VOTE FLEW WAD KEYS GAVE SEES WAGE EAR YOGA VAST POT BIRD FAKE BEEIt’s up to you to decide if this form of base 1751 is easier than base 58 by a sufficient margin to warrant having to deal with an extra non-standard software package. There is, however, another solution that is even easier to memorize. In the ECDSA cryptographic system that Bitcoin relies on almost any 256-bit number can be a private key, so you can make your private key as memorable as you want – you can even make your private key “0101010101010101….” and generate a bitcoin address from the key and everything will work just fine, although you can’t control what the address looks like so you will have to memorize at least 6 random base-58 characters for firstbits to do its job. For security purposes though, it’s better not to make the private key itself memorable but to make the private key generated using a standard function using a phrase or password as a “seed”. The SHA256 cryptographic hash function is generally preferred for this, as it outputs pseudorandom data of exactly the right size from any input and online utilities to compute the SHA256 of any string are easy to find (note that if you’re using the Linux command line, use echo -n rather than echo to pipe into sha256sum; otherwise, you’ll get a different result from other utilities since echo adds a trailing newline by default). After hashing, the seed “correct horse battery staple”, for example, becomes:“c4bbcb1fbec99d65bf59d85c8cb62ee2db963f0fe106f483d9afa73bd4e39a8a“Then, go to bitaddress.org in private browsing mode, turn off your internet and input the private key that you just generated into the box under the “Wallet Details” tab to get the address out:1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1T. Notice how little you really need to memorize to have a brain wallet with this method: following the same process with a much smaller seed and using an address shortener, (\"123\",\"1Bfvq2ap\") is a brain wallet all by itself.Next comes the question of how you can actually use a brain wallet once you have created one. Seeing how much your balance is is fairly easy: go to any blockchain watching site like blockchain.info or blockexplorer.com and search for it. You will be able to see the address’s total current balance and all the transactions that have ever come in or out of it. If you memorized just the first six characters, both services will search for and find your full address automatically. To spend your bitcoins, there are two paths that you can take. The first, easier, option is to import the private key into a wallet or client when you want to use it and simply proceed to send a transaction normally. There are three major clients that allow you to do this: Armory, blockchain.info and Electrum. Armory is a fully fledged Bitcoin client with many features, althought it does have the disadvantage that it requires a powerful computer to run as it currently stores the entire blockchain in memory (you need at least 4GB of RAM). Blockchain.info is a web application that requires no installation, which is much more convenient but slightly less secure because you’re essentially re-downloading the application from the server every time. The other major online wallet, Strongcoin, is also an option, although with it the functionality for generating a private key from a phrase is built in, but it charges a small fee for outgoing transactions. Blockchain.info and Armory, if their respective weaknesses are acceptable to you, have graphical interfaces that are very easy to use and self-explanatory. Electrum requires some basic command line use but it also not very difficult. Once you’ve created an address and private key, to import it into Electrum open up a command line, navigate to the directory Electrum is located in and type in:./electrum import 1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1T:5KJvsngHeMpm884wtkJNzQGaCErckhHJBGFsvd3VyK5qMZXj3hSAnd there you go. You can now send transactions with your Electrum wallet, and for added security you can delete the electrum.dat file (located at ~/.electrum/electrum.dat on Linux) when you’re done.However, if you are storing your wallet in your head because you are paranoid, you may instead prefer the second option: offline transactions. This approach is more secure as it allows you to send transactions without ever having your private key touch a computer that is connected to the internet, so that even if both your computers have viruses on them your bitcoins are still secure. To do this with blockchain.info, you will need to take the following steps:Create a blockchain.info account and log in.Import just your address into your wallet.Log in from a secure computer in offline mode, making sure to use private browsing mode (incognito mode in Chrome). When the system asks you to turn off your internet connection, do so.Import the private key. Your address will automatically appear in your wallet along with it.Click “send money” and follow the onscreen instructions until you get a base 16 number a few hundred characters long. Copy this string down on paper or with a USB key and close the browser window.Copy this string over to the tool at http://blockchain.info/pushtx and send the transaction.With Electrum, the procedure is slightly more complicated:On an offline computer, import the address:Locate the electrum.dat file on the offline computer. This file should be atC:UsersYourUserNameAppDataLocalElectrum on Windows Vista and 7 and ~/.electrum on Linux (sorry, no Mac version as of the time of this writing). Note that for the next step to be valid, the file should be unencrypted. If it’s encrypted (ie. is just a jumble of random data, without any kind of structure), remove it and generate a new wallet (with ./electrum create or the graphical interface) with no password.Make a copy of the file. In that copy, look for the private key that you imported and take it out.Take this neutered wallet and copy it over to your online computer, and wait until the client detects and collects the references to the 5 bitcoins’ worth of transactions that you need to spend.Copy the wallet back to your offline computer and put it back where the original electrum.dat file was.Put the private key back in.Create the transaction offline:./electrum mktx -s 1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1T -c 1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1T 13ignD31FysQbaBBVJUzffcQoFxxEuEcbE 5.00From there, proceed as before. This is one of the highest levels of paranoia that you can possibly reach with Bitcoin, but it is worth it if you are handling large amounts of money. Electrum has three advantages over blockchain.info that may make up for the increased effort. First, you do not have to pay the 0.01 BTC fee per transaction. Second, since Electrum is a desktop application you can keep the computer that handles private keys off the internet 24/7, while with blockchain.info this is much harder as it is a web application – with the blockchain.info wallet you are actually downloading the program that runs within your browser every time you use it. The third problem is another consequence of this fact: if blockchain.info is hacked, the transactions that it generates might be compromised and you would not even know it until the intended recipient tells you that they never got the transaction and you realize that you’ve sent off your precious electronic cash to some teenager in Ukraine. With Electrum, you only download it once, you can check it once if you desire and you do not need to worry about such security issues.Note that Electrum also has a “brain wallet” functionality of its own that offers a compromise between memorizing a premade key and making a key from something you memorized: a 12-word base 1600 “wallet seed” from which Electrum generates five addresses and private keys. You can use roughly the same process as above to send transactions with such a wallet, but removing the seed instead of the private key when copying the wallet over to the online machine.If your goal for having a brain wallet is not security but either as a backup, for the convenience and versatility of having your wallet literally always on you no matter where you are or what you have with you or just to impress your friends, though, you do not need to bother with offline transactions and simply using it in conjunction with other Bitcoin wallets is enough. Just like Bitcoin in general, the concept of a brain wallet is extremely flexible; you can make whatever tradeoff between convenience and security that suits you best.",

    "title": "The last few days have unfortunately brought one piece of grim news after another to the Bitcoin community. As if",
    "text": "The last few days have unfortunately brought one piece of grim news after another to the Bitcoin community. As if the 43000 BTC Linode theft in March was not enough, another 18457 BTC was stolen from Bitcoinica’s reserves, and Zhou Tong was barely able to prevent the thief from getting his hands on 30000 more. Unfortunately, given the financial stress that Bitcoinica was already in after the Linode theft two months ago, even this smaller loss turned out to be the straw that broke the camel’s back. The site was immediately shut down for security reasons, and less than one day later Zhou posted another message compounding the bad news: “It’s more serious than we thought. We need some additional time to come up with a compensation proposal – Likely we will either shut down the platform or re-develop entirely (which will take months instead of days).”Bitcoinica users who have a balance in the service are likely safe. Bitcoinica’s staff is building an account claim page, and the latest news is that users will receive all of their money back, with their US dollar balance liquidated at a settlement price of 4.94-4.98. Bitcoinica itself has, as of two weeks ago, been taken over by Intersango, and the use that the new leadership will put the platform’s code to, if any, is not yet certain.As for Zhou Tong himself, he has decided to leave Bitcoin entirely. The main reason that he gave for leaving is not any lack of confidence in Bitcoin itself – as he himself writes, “I always believe in Bitcoin, or simply anything that brings people financial liberty. I have heavily invested in Bitcoin (I purchased one 1,000 BTC gold coin from Casascius and will keep it for as long as I can).” Rather, he is leaving because he feels that Bitcoin is not his destiny. “I failed at one thing though,” he writes, “that is generating value for the society. Bitcoinica did create a place for people to trade more efficiently and provide liquidity to the market. However, speculation is a zero-sum game (or negative-sum, strictly saying). I know there can be many justifications for Bitcoinica’s value, but all of them are against my intuition and values. With the confidence and the innate intuition to build wonderful things for a better world, I decided to move on.”Many will disagree with him about the social utility of financial speculation services; there is an argument to be made that it promotes price stability and, as the wide array of Bitcoin casinos shows, even negative-sum gambling has value in itself. But where Bitcoinica and Zhou brought the most value to the community has nothing to do with the service itself. Rather, Zhou showed us that the world of Bitcoin is a world where freedom and opportunity reign supreme, and where even a 17 year old with no prior connections can make a difference by virtue of his talent alone. In many ways, he represents Bitcoin’s everyman; the largely self-educated, highly independent individual with a wide variety of interests ranging from computer science to finance and economics to politics to philosophy seizing upon a chance to apply his talents to the world. One could even argue that he is an echo of Satoshi himself.Despite his position as the creator of a financial speculation service and his strong belief in libertarian capitalist ideals, Bitcoinica to him has never been about the profit. “Bitcoinica is not a money making machine,” he writes. “It’s just a product that sets a high standard for the Bitcoin community.” This is something that we all lose track of from time to time. The polarized political dialogue that we are forced to listen to every day on the mainstream media often forces those of us who support financial freedom to at least subconsciously align ourselves with the likely nonexistent ideal type of an individual who cares about nothing but short term wealth, but ultimately, as none other than Ayn Rand pointed out, money is only a tool. It is indeed a very good tool, allowing us to enjoy the products that come out of a highly specialized economy characterized by the division of labor, command services from individuals halfway across the world with whom we have had no prior contact whatsoever and invest for the future without tying ourselves down to a specific project, but it cannot replace the personal drive and vision that is at ultimately the core of both great businesses and projects like Linux, Wikipedia and even Bitcoin itself.Zhou Tong has often been reviled as a scammer, and this crisis has, predictably, only amplified such cries. But his actions over the past eight months do not paint the picture of a man who consciously set out to defraud the public with a Ponzi scheme or an arcane system of liquidation rules; rather, they paint the picture of a teenager, still uncorrupted by the rigidities of the status quo, ready to discover the world and find a place where he can make a difference. Of course, Bitcoinica’s history is marked by security blunders and telling signs of Zhou’s inexperience. However, failure is an inevitable part of learning and innovation, and if the Bitcoin community begins to treat failure as an unforgivable sin and every blunder as proof of moral turpitude, then it will cease to be a community that values learning and innovation at all. Instead, it will become yet another manifestation of the inflexible and bureaucratic status quo. The Apollo program killed three people before it got a single one on the moon, and Socrates’ contributions to philosophy would never have appeared had he listened to his detractors’ complaints that he was corrupting the youth. Rather than disparaging Zhou for being too inexperienced to succeed, we should be praising him for daring to try. While his first endeavor has now failed, and even his second may fail too, perhaps his third might succeed, and in our world of unlimited growth and infinite possibility the amount that we all gain from one great success outweighs the disappointment of even a hundred failures.Lastly, although this first implementation of Bitcoinica may have died, the idea has not. The demand for a service like Bitcoinica has been proven to exist, and it’s only a matter of time until it resurfaces in some other form. Ringcoin’s new Kronos.io will soon provide an even more secure alternative by using its ZipConf instant Bitcoin transfer technology to remove the need to have a potentially vulnerable “hot wallet” at all, and more competition may be around the corner.",

    "text": "This article was originally written on March 28, 2012Following the recent Linode theft, in which over 43000 total bitcoins were stolen from Bitcoinica, MtGox enacted a new policy in an attempt to help stop the thief get away with his illicit gains: they began freezing accounts with bitcoins that could be traced back to the theft and demanding that they submit identification to regain access to their accounts.MtGox has admitted that they are cooperating with the Japanese CyberPolice in an attempt to determine the identity of the thief, and it is possible that their strategy will help achieve such a goal. Even if someone trying to sell the tainted bitcoins through MtGox is not the seller himself, a fact that even MtGox themselves have admitted is almost certainly true in every case, they would likely know something about the person who sent the coins to them, and the police, working with MtGox and other Bitcoin services, could theoretically trace their way back through each link, asking the receiver of each transaction who sent it to him, until they arrive at the original thief. It’s hard to tell how practical such a strategy actually is, although if it is possible at all it is the largest heists, those whose value swamps any mixing pool that the thief tries to use, that would be the easiest to unravel.However, some suspect that there may be motives at play beyond simply wanting justice for Bitcoinica. Over time, MtGox has built in more and more authentication features, first requiring email addresses for accounts since last June, and later requiring identification for accounts handling large amounts of bitcoin, and this too may be part of a long-term plan to slowly get the Bitcoin community used to accounts being linked to their owners’ legal identities. Anti-money laundering law requires businesses transferring significant quantities of money to “know your customer”, and MtGox may have realized that they are bound by such laws and are currently not in compliance with them, so they are doing their best to become legal without clamping down too hard all at once. During the security crisis and the media attention on illegal uses for Bitcoin last June, MtGox stated their willingness to work with law enforcement authorities to track down criminals and resolve legal issues, so it has for a long time been known that those interested in using Bitcoin as a tool to fight against government surveillance and probihitions should not look to MtGox for aid. And this is arguably the most logical position for them to take; since they are such a central entity to the Bitcoin economy it would hurt the economy, both legal and illegal, far more if they were shut down than if they enacted some authentication requirements that can still be bypassed simply by going through less prominent exchanges instead.Others accuse MtGox of simple theft, but this seems highly unlikely. MtGox has no way of knowing if a frozen account will ever be claimed, so if they were to cash out on their gains they would effectively be operating under a fractional reserve, a policy which, if it were ever leaked or otherwise revealed, would effectively destroy MtGox’s reputation and seriously hurt Bitcoin’s public image, both of which they have already demonstrated a willingness to sacrifice short-term profits for when they bailed out the hacked exchange bitomat.pl in August.MtGox’s move raises other concerns too. The most common is that it undermines the fungibility of bitcoins; the idea that one bitcoin is one bitcoin, no matter which bitcoin it is and where it came from. By flagging 43000 BTC as tainted, MtGox is substituting this model with one where some bitcoins have more value than others. Some have suggested that this is a good thing, and the Bitcoin community can expand upon the idea and adopt a self-policing mechanism by which most clients are configured to reject bitcoins that have been confirmed as stolen. However, there are many ways to criticize such a system. First of all, such a scheme would rely on a centralized authority, which Bitcoin was designed to avoid. A polycentric system may be possible, but if one authority becomes accepted by the majority of users the system will fall into a stable equilibrium of centralization which is so hard to get out of that it would be easier to create a new currency. Once the mechanism is in place, governments can easily take it over and gain the power to penalize whomever they want and make any bitcoin-handling service unusable. Second, the thief will most likely exchange his stolen coins immediately, before the community even finds out what’s going on, and it would be average users, not the thief, who are inconvenienced when they discover that a fraction of their money is suddenly worthless. The system would essentially serve as a chaotic transaction tax, not affecting those who simply hoard their bitcoins but adding an element of fear to every transaction as the coins that the receiver received may suddenly become worthless. The end result would be an undermining of the trust and integrity of the Bitcoin system as a whole.Fortunately, MtGox is not confiscating tainted coins or declaring them worthless; for now they are simply requiring identification for a few accounts. The move should be interpreted not so much as MtGox asserting themselves as a government of the Bitcoin world, but as a step toward the legitimatization of the currency. MtGox is not mandatory; those who prefer not to be tracked in their bitcoin usage can always go to one of the many secondary exchanges or even arrange a physical transaction and throw potential investigators even further off their tracks by depositing and withdrawing their coins through Silk Road. If we want to restrain MtGox’s power to decide how the Bitcoin economy functions, perhaps it is most appropriate look not at each specific move that they are making, but at their near-monopoly 86% market share, and question why they have so much power in the first place.",

With high tech payment methods available such as NFC by phone that works on all forms of public transportation and usable at convenience stores as cash, and instant and free for same-bank transfer wire transfers by phone app, many Asian countries such as South Korea already have a favorite digital payment method supported by the government and numerous technology firms.This did not prevent interest in Bitcoin from cropping up as far back as the $30 days of July 2011, and since then more and more students and businessmen alike have been looking into Bitcoin to see what all this noise was about.In an effort to further educate and provide a strong resource for interested consumers and merchants, Bitcoin Magazine is seeking major distribution in the country through Kyobo bookstores, the Korean equivalent of Barnes & Noble bookstores.While the Korean distribution contracts are planned through Amazon and Kyobo, Bitcoin Magazine has already found its first home in Suji, a moderately new bustling city right smack dab in the middle of the oldest and richest cities in the Gyeonggido province, between Bundang and Yongin.The first store to carry the Bitcoin Magazine is 용인수지문고 (“Yongin Suji Books”), a bookstore with a built in a Natuur ice cream shop lounge for easy reading and relaxation as can be seen in the photos below.

    "text": "For better or for worse, Silk Road has been a fixture in the Bitcoin economy ever since the currency first caught the attention of the mainstream media in early 2011. The service is an online black marketplace for goods such as drugs, pirated digital goods, books on topics such as computer hacking and drug manufacture, counterfeits and forgeries, complete with an Ebay (or Bitmit)-style user interface, an escrow system and a Bitcoin wallet that mixes all incoming and outgoing coins so as to obscure their origin. It operates completely anonymously, existing to the outside world only as a so-called “hidden service” on the Tor network, run by a user who is known to others only as “Dread Pirate Roberts”. It maintains the secrecy of its operators and location by combining two technologies: Tor, the largely US military-funded internet anonymizing service intended to help dissidents in authoritarian regimes evade the prying eyes of their governments, and Bitcoin. The former makes it extremely difficult to trace buyers and sellers’ communications, and the latter, combined with Silk Road’s proprietary mixing system, their financial trail.Silk Road attracts people for many reasons. Some are simply interested in having a safe and easy place to buy and sell illegal items, of which drugs are by far the largest category. Others cite costs as a factor. One writer, Gwern, claimed in his review of Silk Road that he was able to find Adderall on sale for a “price per pill far superior to that I was quoted by one of my college-age friends (less than 1/3 the price) and also better than the Adderall price quote in the New Yorker, $15 for 20mg”. For others, Silk Road is an ideological mission far more than it is about the goods. Dread Pirate Roberts frequently promotes libertarian political principles on his own forum, and there is a common consensus that fining and imprisoning people for putting substances into their own bodies is morally wrong. The crypto-anarchist movement, which seeks to remove the potential for individuals and institutions to exert power over others by moving key social institutions onto mathematically secured, and often anonymous, internet-based protocols, also finds the service attractive. As governments continue attempting to push restrictive internet legislation such as SOPA and ACTA into law, the allure of using Tor to make such government machinations simply irrelevant will only continue to increase. Finally, there are some legal products available for sale on Silk Road, and even for those who are not interested in using Silk Road to circumvent the law the service provides an active community in which entrepreneurs can nurture their online business and potentially develop a second income from the comfort of their own homes.Silk Road first truly broke into the public view on June 1, 2011, when an article on gawker.com made a detailed review of the service, and membership quickly jumped by an order of magnitude to over ten thousand. A few days later, the US government caught on, and senators Charles Schumer and Joe Manchin called for the website to be shut down immediately, proclaiming that “Never before has a website so brazenly peddled illegal drugs online” and “by cracking down on the website immediately, we can help stop these drugs from flooding our streets.” Since this brief spark, however, Silk Road has faded somewhat into the background. On June 9, the Bitcoin price bubble finally popped, and attention quickly turned to first this, then to further negative attention on Bitcoin’s economic properties, and finally a security crisis involving a series of unrelated events in late June, continuing in August as bitomat.pl was hacked and the first online Bitcoin wallet, MyBitcoin, disappeared with 51% of its users’ deposits.Silk Road suffered as the price fell from $31 to $2 between June and November, making it difficult for sellers to make money, but the service retained a loyal following and its users were eventually rewarded with the price rebounding and stabilizing in early 2012. The number of accounts is currently at about 22000, and the largest number of people online at any given time is 126 – a stable community, but much smaller than those who see Silk Road as being the single shadowy force keeping up the Bitcoin economy behind the scenes imagine. About three quarters of its users are from the United States, although British and European users are a sizeable minority. One reason for this is the relative ease of buying bitcoins in the US, as well as the higher interest in drugs there, but the divide is also because Silk Road does little to cater to its non-US customers. For example, Silk Road users have the option of seeing prices in BTC or USD, but not any other currency. This is particularly of concern for non-US sellers, because they, unlike sellers who are based in the US, do not have the choice of setting a price for their goods that is fixed in their local currency. Language is another concern; foreign language support is nonexistent, and even dedicated subforums for second-tier languages are lacking.So far, there have been no reports of anyone being arrested as a result of Silk Road activity, and there are good reasons to believe that while the DEA may find Silk Road worth keeping an eye on, they are not actively attempting to identify buyers or sellers. As one Silk Road user, vlad1m1r, who confines himself to the strictly legal activity of selling bitcoins in exchange for cash in the mail in the UK, writes, “I find it implausible that they are monitoring it on a daily basis as it’s simply not an effective use of resources due to the anonymous nature of the Tor network and the use of GPG encrypted messages to exchange personal information. Users occasionally speculate that this vendor or that may be LE (Law Enforcement) but I doubt very much that a Police officer would sell drugs in order to make arrests as this would be textbook entrapment.” The last claim, that a police officer selling drugs constitutes entrapment, is a legally complicated one; USLegal defines entrapment as being “when [a person] is induced or persuaded by law enforcement officers or their agents to commit a crime that he had no previous intent to commit”; someone actively searching drug listings on Silk Road would likely not fall under the definition. Nevertheless, the argument that it’s not worth it to spend the resources going after Silk Road is a valid one, and law enforcement officials who are more interested in mitigating the social consequences of drug sellers and gangs on the streets than in pursuing a prohibitionist agenda as an end in itself may well decide to leave Silk Road alone simply because buying drugs on the internet is much safer than the alternative.The relationship between Silk Road’s users and its management tends to be a positive one. As vlad1m1r describes it, “we do get the occasional malcontent who complains that their thread was arbitrarily deleted or that the creator of Silk Road himself DPR hasn’t deigned to address their particular concern, but people are generally polite when asking for new products or help with using the site, and the admins largely reciprocate.” One of the factors contributing to Silk Road’s cohesive community is the high level of trust. Scams are a serious problem on the darknets because of the anonymity of the participants and the fact that going to the police for help necessarily implies confessing to a crime, and Silk Road is one of the few places that attempts to counteract this with a reputation system and a built-in escrow service.However, there are problems. One major controversy among the service’s users is that of morality. There have been instances of people putting up images which constitute child pornography in some jurisdictions but are acceptable in others, and the Silk Road administration tends to stick to its own moral philosophy in such cases, not taking down consensual images which are slightly underage but strictly prohibiting products of genuine abuse. There have also been requests for credit card skimming devices, which are not allowed under Silk Road law, but which some people believe are no more immoral than counterfeits and drugs. Weapons were another concern, and Dread Pirate Roberts eventually resolved that particular concern with the middle-of-the-road option of banning them from Silk Road itself but allowing them on a specifically designed sister site called The Armory. Services such as theft and contract killing are banned from Silk Road and The Armory entirely, although some Silk Road users point buyers interested in such goods to a competing site with no moral restrictions at all, Black Market Reloaded.The other issue, although not a controversy, revolves around the escrow system. The default way of making transactions in Silk Road is for the buyer to send his funds not to the seller directly, but to the escrow system, which notifies the seller that it received and is holding the funds. When the buyer receives his product, he notifies the escrow system that the transaction was successful, and the seller gets his money. Some sellers, however, ask their buyers to bypass this mechanism and send directly to them for convenience, a practice which is heavily frowned upon by the Silk Road administration and community, but is nevertheless sometimes done. On April 20, many sellers on Silk Road celebrated the service’s first birthday by hosting special sales of their products at reduced prices, and one established vendor, Tony76, used the opportunity to sell a large number of orders and ran off with the money. There is some speculation as to just how much Tony76 was able to steal, but it is known that he transferred at least $30,000 worth of bitcoins off the site. Since then, the use of escrow has gained in popularity once again, and the possibility of making escrow mandatory, while not currently implemented, is always under discussion.Outside opinion on Silk Road is split. Some believe that the Bitcoin economy would be better off without such services tarnishing its reputation, as it would be better able to market itself as a currency with legitimate uses, while others openly embrace the underground economy either seeing its liberation as an end in itself or respecting its potential to act as a bootstrapping mechanism for Bitcoin. In terms of its size, Silk Road is currently Bitcoin’s largest e-commerce platform, having about twice as many products as its largest legal competitor, bitmit.net, but it is far from being Bitcoin’s economic powerhouse, a title to which businesses like Butterfly Labs and BitInstant hold a much greater claim. Both supporters of Silk Road’s particular brand of crypto-anarchic freedom and people concerned with Bitcoin’s public image can rest assured that Silk Road is nowhere near taking over the Bitcoin economy, but neither is it going away.",

    "text": "Bitcoinica has fallen far in these past four months. The margin trading service that was once hailed as a revolutionary margin trading service and a shining beacon of success in the Bitcoin economy has become a locus of scandals and thefts, as skilled online intruders continue to peck at the now defunct service's diminishing million-dollar supply of customers' funds and its operators continue to struggle to pay users even a 50% share of what they are owed.Bitcoinica's downfall started on March 1. Linode, a web hosting provider then used by Bitcoinica, Slush and the Bitcoin Faucet, was hacked by an unknown intruder, who proceeded to empty all Bitcoin wallets that were running on the service, taking 5 BTC from the Bitcoin Faucet, 3,000 BTC from Slush and 43,000 BTC, then worth about $220,000 USD, from Bitcoinica. The loss was a large one, but the site nevertheless kept running and was able to guarantee its users' deposits. Then, however, came a second attack. On May 11, an intruder managed to break into Bitcoinica through a compromised email account, and proceeded to lift 18500 BTC from Bitcoinica's hot wallet. This time, the site could not keep operating, and it shut down and opened up a claims process through which users could petition for a refund on their deposits. However, the intruder also managed to delete Bitcoinica's account registry, leaving the team in charge of the claims process no way to verify user account balances was to look through a collection of various trading records, causing the claims proceedings to slow down to a crawl.Now, Bitcoinica has been struck yet again. On July 13, another thief withdrew the maximum possible from the MtGox account that was holding the remaining portion of Bitcoinica users' funds, clearing out 40,000 BTC and 40,000 USD, or a net total of $350,000 USD at the time of the breach. The attack was possible because the LastPass account that was storing the passwords needed to access the MtGox account was set to the same password as the MtGox API key used by the Bitcoinica server to access funds when Bitcoinica was still running. While the original thief had the opportunity to steal these funds at any point after the breach on May 11, the opportunity became accessible to anyone a few days before this latest theft, when the Bitcoinica server's source code was publicly released to the internet. The API key was stored in the source code, and another thief discovered that the key was also the LastPass password, and that no form of additional second-factor authentication was required to use the Last Pass account, and proceeded to log on to MtGox and withdraw the funds.Regardless of his level of responsibility for earlier breaches that had to do with the security of Bitcoinica itself, this time Zhou Tong is clearly innocent. He writes in a thread on Hacker News on the subject: \"I didn't set the password. I didn't have the power to change the password. I shouldn't have access to the account. The root cause is LastPass account being stolen.\" And the other parties agree; both Bitcoin Consultancy and Tihan Seale, Bitcoinica's secretive investor, much prefer to blame each other, the core issue being who is responsible for setting the two passwords to the same value. As Bitcoin Consultancy's Amir Taaki writes, \"The breach today occurred because the password for LastPass was in fact a duplicate password which had been compromised during the hack. Unbeknownst to us, Tihan was using the mtgox api key as the password for a website called LastPass.\" Tihan, on the other hand, showed himself for only the third time so far on the Bitcointalk forums and wrote :\"I claim no expertise to judge the security of the master password but it was very long. Its status as a master password and its use in all respects were fully understood by the Consultancy upon acceptance. If the Consultancy deemed this password to be unfit for ongoing use, they certainly had the opportunity and the duty to change it.\" This miscommunication appears to be the core of the problem, regardless of whether the greater problem was Tihan not clearly speaking or Bitcoin Consultancy not clearly listening.As for what this means for the users, the result is that claimants will be forced to take a 30% cut on their deposits. Because of the difficulty of figuring out some users' exact balances, the claims fund had settled on a strategy of paying claims in two stages - 50% as soon as the claim is processed, and the remainder of the claims fund proportionately to all depositors once all claims are processed. About 40% of claims have been processed so far, and, as far as can be determined for certain, so far no one has received more than 50%, so the general strategy for determining and paying claims is expected to hold even if the second round of payments will be in the form of 20% of claimants' funds rather than the entire remaining 50%. However, the implementation of the strategy will be a problem - Amir Taaki reported in his post on the subject that “The payments process was looking good, but now Patrick [the sole individual responsible for handling claims up to now] has walked away and I'm unsure what happens next.” Meanwhile, Zhou Tong has come up with his own solution: he created his own claims processing service, voluntarily contributing 5,000 BTC out of his own profits from running and selling Bitcoinica to spread among all claims that he deemed valid. Over 80,000 BTC worth of claims were filed, and claimants received a 6.239% share of their losses. Zhou Tong emphasizes that his process was independent from Bitcoinica, and that both his claimants and those who missed the opportunity should seek their 70% payment from the official claims process as well.Many victims of the crisis have already written off the situation as hopeless and are content to simply wait and see if they ever do get any of their money back, but others are not so willing to back down. The possibility that there will be a lawsuit against Bitcoinica is very real, and what will happen to the claims process in that case is unknown - Bitcoinica Consultancy’s Patrick Strateman, at least, believes that “if anybody decides to file a criminal complaint you will effectively guarantee that it will be months or even years before anybody sees their funds.” Whatever direction Bitcoinica Consultancy chooses to take the claims proceedings from here, one can only hope that depositors will be able to collect the remaining portion of the funds from Bitcoinica's supply faster than the thieves will.",

    "text": "Last November, Mitchell Bourne, with the aid of the Bitcoin Consultancy, organized a highly successful Bitcoin conference in Prague, featuring speakers from both inside the Bitcoin community, like We Use Coins creator and BitcoinJS developer Stefan Thomas and Bitcoin Consultancy member Amir Taaki, and outside of it, like Pirate Party founder Rick Falkvinge and digital money theorist David Birch. This year, the Bitcoin Consultancy intends to hold a conference again on 15-16 September, this time in London. The last conference was held in Prague because the venue was less expensive and it was not clear how many people would attend, but with the Prague conference behind them this time, the team is more certain that the conference will succeed, and are expecting over 300 attendees.Hosting the conference in London will have a number of advantages. London is the home of the Bitcoin Consultancy, as well as many of the speakers that are invited to the conference, and even for those who do not live in the United Kingdom, London is much easier to reach than Prague is, with several international airports around the city allowing for direct flights from many cities around the world.The list of speakers is already a long one, and includes a number of individuals from within the Bitcoin community. This year’s selection is heavy on the technical side, featuring Mike Hearn, developer of the Java-based Bitcoin platform BitcoinJ, once again the BitcoinJS developer Stefan Thomas, Patrick Strateman, Bitcoin Consultancy member and the chief technology officer of Intersango and Jim Burton, lead developer of the Bitcoin client Multibit. On the less technical side will be Max Keiser, in charge of his finance-oriented show on Russia Today, the Keiser Report, and Matthew N Wright, who is involved in a number of Bitcoin-related projects, including Bitcoin Magazine itself.However, what is more impressive are the non-Bitcoin speakers. Looking at the list of speakers, the conference can just as easily be described as a Linux conference as a Bitcoin one. On the list are many developers who are focused on Linux and Bitcoin at the same time, although typically with more attention toward Linux, as Linux offers more opportunities for developers to express themselves than Bitcoin, where the technical side is already largely settled. Among these are Dennis Rolo, also known as Jaromil, both an advocate of underground economies and a developer of Linux multimedia systems, Nils Schneider (tcatm), known to the Bitcoin community for Bitcoin Watch and Bitcoin Charts but also the creator of the iPod Linux project, Jeff Garzik, a prominent Linux kernel developer who also spends time on Bitcoin development, and, most important of all, Richard Stallman, the free software advocate who created the GNU operating system that forms the basis for most of the Linux distributions that we use today.There will also be several speakers outside of both the Bitcoin and Linux communities. Once again on the technical side, there will be Andrew Miller, co-founder of a computer vision consulting firm and contributor to OpenKinect and the decentralized file storage system Tahoe-LAFS. On the non-technical side, David Birch, who spoke at the 2011 Prague conference, will once again be attending, and from the civil liberties community there will be a new guest: Birgitta Jónsdóttir, the Icelandic parliament member responsible for creating the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative, which introduced anti-censorship, freedom of information and whistleblower protection laws that have placed Iceland at the top of the Press Freedom Index in the world.To the Bitcoin Community, what this conference signifies most of all is the growing integration of Bitcoin into the larger technology and civil liberties community. Even one year ago, Bitcoin was largely on its own, and the rest of the technology community was largely watching the currency from the sidelines. The only prominent individual who made a serious attempt to conceive of Bitcoin as being part of a larger philosophy of individual empowerment was arguably Rick Falkvinge. After surviving a bubble and crash and continuing to attract more attention, however, a growing number of people are realizing that Bitcoin is only one tool in a much larger arsenal, and this year’s list of speakers reflects that reality. Hopefully, this conference will prove to be of major benefit to both the Bitcoin Consultancy, desperate to recover its public image after the Bitcoinica fiasco, the Bitcoin community, as the event has the potential to bring Bitcoin considerable media attention, and the free software and civil liberties community as a whole.",

    "title": "The Middle East and North Africa remain one of the more difficult parts of the world in which to acquire",
    "text": "The Middle East and North Africa remain one of the more difficult parts of the world in which to acquire bitcoins. Although largely justified by the region’s low GDP, the concentration of Bitcoin clients in the region is low, and options for exchanging the local forms of digital money for bitcoins were hard to find – until now. Bitcoin Nordic recently introduced CashU as a payment option. Bitcoin Nordic is a Bitcoin exchange based in Denmark launched on April 2 with its main feature being instant delivery of bitcoins for payments by credit card. This activity was soon suspended by Visa and MasterCard, but the company remained, and continues to offer bitcoins for bank transfers (and vice versa) and anonymous cash in the mail, expanding their range of payment offers with this new addition.CashU is a popular online and mobile payment method in North Africa and the Middle East, as the region’s large and young population currently has very limited access to credit cards. It works as a prepaid system, allowing users to top up their CashU accounts through CashU prepaid cards sold in the Middle East and Africa, Ukash vouchers which can be found around the world including the UK, mainland Europe, South Africa, South America, Canada and Australia, and a number of other methods. Users can then spend their CashU account balance at a number of online sites. Bitcoin Nordic claims that by introducing CashU as a payment option, they will have made Bitcoin accessible to over 300 million people who did not have a convenient way to buy it previously.Bitcoin Nordic’s prices are steep; they charge a 15% commission on top of the 24-hour average MtGox price, higher than the 10% that they charge for cash and check payments, and much higher than the 0-7% fees typical for cash deposits and wire transfers in the United States. However, relative to other fees in the CashU market, Bitcoin Nordic’s rates are hardly exceptional. Although credit card payments and some other methods like Fawry and BEE are processed with a fee of 5-7%, UKash vouchers take 9% plus foreign exchange rates. Comparing these rates to Google’s baseline rates, we see that this constitutes an additional commission of roughly 5% – in total a 14% fee, almost exactly as much as what Bitcoin Nordic charges for converting CashU to Bitcoin.Nevertheless, even with net fees of 20-30%, Bitcoin Nordic has potential to carve out a viable niche for itself for one simple reason: it has no competition. Although CashU is the established payment method of the region and is already used by much of the population, the range of sites that accepts it is fairly small. Though many major products like World of Warcraft and iTunes gift cards can be bought with CashU, the majority of the products and services that we are used to in Europe and North America do not support it. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does – both by itself and as a gateway to other stores through services like SpendBitcoins, which offers gift codes for stores like Amazon, the Apple store and Thinkgeek for bitcoins and even features a Buy Anything service that allows you to use Bitcoin as a proxy for any purchase online.In the past few months, Bitcoin has seen a massive increase in its reach all across the world. Chinese adoption spiked rapidly in May, BitInstant added 700,000 locations to buy bitcoins in the USA, Russia and Brazil, and, although with no evidence of success so far, efforts to bring Bitcoin into Africa are underway as well. With this move by Bitcoin Nordic, the Middle East and North Africa will now be able to participate in Bitcoin’s worldwide growth in adoption, and millions of people will gain access to products and services that they had no way of getting to before, both inside the Bitcoin community and outside of it.",

    "title": "Much has happened since the first Silk Road report that we released a month ago. In mid-July, a Silk Road",
    "text": "Much has happened since the first Silk Road report that we released a month ago. In mid-July, a Silk Road user was arrested by Australian police for allegedly transporting unspecified narcotics into the country. The event attracted considerable attention within the Bitcoin community as it was the first “Silk Road-related” arrest ever to take place, and the Australian police eagerly took the opportunity to warn Australians that law enforcement is “well aware of this method of drug procurement” and that “persons who buy or sell through online marketplaces, on so-called ‘anonymous’ networks should understand that they are not guaranteed anonymity.” However, it is important to point out that neither the anonymity of Tor nor that of Bitcoin was compromised. Rather, all evidence points to the seller being caught through the international mail system. It is also well understood that island nations have an easier time controlling their borders, whether against illegal immigrants, drugs or guns, than most others, so on the whole the event is not particularly surprising.Soon after, Dread Pirate Roberts, the mastermind behind Silk Road, announced that Silk Road’s illegal gun-selling sister site The Armory would be closing. To justify the decision, Roberts wrote in a post on the Silk Road forums (original accessible only through Tor) that it simply was not popular enough to justify the expense; in his own words. “The volume hasn’t even been enough to cover server costs and is actually waning at this point. I had high hopes for it, but if we are going to serve an anonymous weapons market, I think it will require more careful thought and planning.” Unlike its larger cousin Silk Road, the Armory was never well received by the Bitcoin community or the media; many to whom the thought of legalizing all drugs is not even controversial, particularly those in Europe, find the prospect of psychopaths being able to anonymously buy guns much more worrying. The one major article covering it in the news came only weeks before the announcement, in the form of a piece on Gizmodo titled “The Secret Online Weapons Store That’ll Sell Anyone Anything“. The article did misrepresent the Armory to some extent, the largest offense being a claim that its cryptic garbled sixteen-character URL was part of a deliberate strategy of obfuscation (in reality, the Tor protocol offers no way, except perhaps extreme repeated trial and error, to choose one’s URL, as the generation process is a pseudorandom process somewhat similar to that used to generate Bitcoin addresses), but it did provide the Armory a last chance at acquiring a foothold in the illegal arms market. However, even that failed to reignite attention; at the time of this writing, the number of products available is less than sixty, and the Armory will soon be gone entirely. Weapons will not become allowed on Silk Road as a substitute.The Australian arrest may shed some light on why Silk Road, the anonymous illegal drug store, has been able to succeed and the Armory, the anonymous illegal gun store, has not. The major bottleneck of both is the postal system, and drugs are much easier to sneak through than guns are. The former usually comes in the form of small tablets or a powder which can be reliably placed in vacuum sealed bags, while the latter, even if disassembled into its constituent parts, is made up of large pieces, any of which can trip a metal detector. The requirement for the customer to assemble the weapon also hampers usability, and the requirement for the seller to disassemble and spend more time packaging it drives up costs, which are another major reason why many potential customers opted to continue purchasing their weapons through offline channels instead.Finally, a few days ago, Nicolas Cristin, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, released a detailed analysis of Silk Road in which he discovered considerable evidence that pointed to a, to some, exciting, and to others, frightening conclusion: that, unlike its arms-dealing sister site, the Silk Road is booming. According to Cristin’s paper, at the end of November 2011, Silk Road had 220 active sellers, increasing to 290 on March 1, but the number then started to quickly climb, leading to the site having over 550 active sellers at the end of July. In the previous Silk Road report it was mentioned that the majority of sellers were from the US, with a sizeable minority in the UK, a fact which Cristin’s paper corroborates: the most popular shipping origin, the USA, is the home of 43.86% of all sellers, followed by “undeclared” with 16.28% and the UK with 10.14%. Customer satisfaction on Silk Road is mostly positive, with a 97.8% positive feedback rate, although less than that on white market sites like Ebay, which boasts a positive feedback rate of 99%. But the most surprising figure of all is Silk Road’s sales volume. The volume was about 8,000 BTC daily in March, increasing to a peak of 15,000 BTC per day in May and then slowly falling to 10,500 BTC a day in July. But, as the paper points out, the fall was merely a nominal one, caused entirely by the rise in the Bitcoin price over the same period. In USD, the total sales volume in each of the past two months, June and July, exceeds $2 million. And, as Cristin points out, that does not even include the hidden listings.For comparison, BitPay processed $170,000 in May and hit a record of $250,000 in one day with Butterfly’s ASIC launch. BitInstant transferred $1.1 million in April, and MtGox had a trading volume of $18 million these last 30 days, although the latter figure is hardly comparable to the others because the vast majority of Bitcoin exchange trading volume is a result of arbitrage and speculation. Silk Road’s revenue compares even better: while BitPay’s commission of 0.99% brought in $1,700 and BitInstant’s 0-5%, at most $60,000, Silk Road’s average commission of 7.4% nets the site over $180,000 USD per month, exceeding even the $45,000 to $108,000 earned by MtGox.Given Silk Road’s low-profile stance in the Bitcoin community, these figures come as a shock. Far from being an easily ignorable sideshow, Silk Road is, in fact, a mainstay of the Bitcoin economy. Furthermore, Silk Road is not merely a particularly popular toy. Dividing Silk Road’s monthly volume of $2 million by its 550 active sellers gives an average revenue of $4500 per month, strongly suggesting that there are dozens of individuals earning a living largely or exclusively using the website. On the one hand, Bitcoin advocates can rejoice; there is now definitive proof that Bitcoin has found a stable and serious niche, one that is not merely a byproduct of novelty or community patriotism, and there are individuals beyond infrastructure providers like BitInstant and MtGox who are employed in the Bitcoin economy full time. But at the same time, as the law is beginning to turn its eyes toward Bitcoin with Brazil’s securities commission targeting a Bitcoin investment group and two legal actions being brought forward around the events of the Bitcoinica crisis, one cannot help but worry about the effect that this will have on Bitcoin’s public image in the months and years to come.",

Always tread carefully when trading on the Bitcoin markets.Ever since Bitcoinica shut down following the hack on May 11, the Bitcoin economy has lacked a way of betting for or against the Bitcoin price at leverage. While it is always possible to buy bitcoins and sell them, what Bitcoinica allowed users to do was to use a small quantity of bitcoins as collateral to hold a much larger quantity of virtual bitcoins or USD, balanced out with a negative balance in the other currency, allowing anyone to realize much higher losses and gains off of a limited amount of capital than can be achieved through simple trading, and also allowing traders to change their positions in any direction instantly without having to wait days for deposits at Bitcoin exchanges to process.Furthermore, because margin trading allows users to hold a negative quantity of bitcoins, Bitcoinica allowed users to profit when the price dropped – a possibility which many believe had a valuable dampening effect on potential Bitcoin bubbles by providing an economic outlet for traders to express their caution. Almost immediately after Bitcoinica shut down, the three-month period of extreme price stability that had prevailed since mid-February ended, and the Bitcoin price began slowly rising. Some are concerned that without the economic tools that Bitcoinica offered, there was nothing to prevent the current rally from turning into another bubble and crash like that seen last June. Also, margin trading tools have another valuable use: they allow merchants to cancel out the exposure to Bitcoin price movements that they naturally get from holding currency for operational purposes, and with no such service available managing risk for Bitcoin merchants becomes considerably more difficult.However, for the past several months, a new competitor has been slowly growing to fill the niche: icbit.se. Icbit was first launched in November 2011 with little fanfare, as the original margin trading service, Bitcoinica, was in full swing at the time. Throughout winter and spring 2012, the site continued to slowly and progressively add features, and it was not until July that the number of users started to pick up. Since then, growth is once again at a relative standstill, and the site is processing a relatively steady 2000 BTC per day on its exchange and 1500 BTC per day in the “futures” section, the part that allows Bitcoinica-like margin trading.The site differs from Bitcoinica in two key ways. First of all, while Bitcoinica dealt directly in bitcoins and USD, allowing users to hold positive and negative quantities of each one, icbit.se accomplishes the same functionality using contracts called “futures”. Technically speaking, a futures contract is an agreement between two parties that one will sell a quantity of an underlying asset to the other at a given price at some pre-determined point in the future. For example, one might have a futures contract between A and B stating that A will sell one bitcoin to B for $13 on January 1, 2013. If the price of a bitcoin is $18 by then, A will be forced to buy the bitcoin on the open market and sell it at the reduced price, taking a loss of $5 that B will receive as a profit. For assets with low storage costs (a classification which Bitcoin fits perfectly), the price of futures closely follows the price of the actual asset, as when the two veer too far apart, it opens an opportunity for anyone to make a profit from arbitrage by buying one and selling the other at the same time.Icbit allows users to do all of this using a very simple interface. The buying and selling is abstracted away and the future is defined as a “difference contract”: if the price of a bitcoin is above $13 on the expiration date, A simply pays B the difference directly, and vice versa if the price drops below. Buying a future constitutes making a bet that the price will go up, and selling a future constitutes making a bet that the price will go down. Just like at a Bitcoin exchange, to buy a future on Icbit, one can either place an offer himself, which will remain on the orderbook until someone accepts it, or one can match someone else’s offer already on the books. When the order is filled, he and the other party are locked into the contract, and the process is complete. Selling a future follows the exact same process.It is possible to buy futures with a higher total value than the amount of BTC that you have deposited or sell futures without buying them first – the only limit is a requirement to have enough BTC deposited to be able to pay for a 10% change in the price – similar to Bitcoinica’s limit of 10x leverage. If the price rises or falls enough that your account’s net worth falls below zero, Icbit attempts to liquidate your position by making automatic transactions on the market, and if there are no asks or bids available the algorithm moves to a last resort of closing your futures early, forcing your counterparties to accept a limited, albeit generous, profit.There is currently only one futures contract sold, “BTCUSD-12.12″, which expires in December, but most users do not wait that long. If one holds a positive number of futures, he can liquidate his position by selling them, reducing his next exposure to zero and unlocking his margin balance, allowing him to immediately withdraw. If he holds a negative number of futures, he can buy futures to cover the difference to the same effect. Icbit automatically rearranges the counterparties behind the scenes so that when you liquidate and withdraw, the rest of the users can continue trading without disruption.The futures model can be applied to much more than trading bitcoins, and Icbit already has plans to that effect. Eventually, BTC-denominated futures contracts will be able to be made with not just BTC as an underlying asset, but also major indices and commodities like the S&P 500 and the Brent crude oil price. Theoretically, any stock, commodity, index or even arbitrary variable like the temperature can be used as a basis for futures contracts, so if the site continues to grow, it has plenty of room to expand.There is also one other key difference between Icbit and Bitcoinica: on Icbit, all transactions are made between the users themselves. While Bitcoinica had users trade with the service, employing an algorithm to buy and sell on MtGox to cover its users positions, Icbit allows the trades to happen by themselves, and only takes a flat fee of 0.005 BTC per 1 BTC in each contract as revenue. This model ensures that Icbit will be able to operate with less financial risk, a problem that Bitcoinica struggled with as its profits went from $100,000 per month to near zero in March due to a problem with the algorithm. The model will likely also ensure higher security, as the service can run without leaving as much money in a potentially vulnerable “hot wallet”. The problem with this setup is that liquidity is not guaranteed, a problem which Icbit is currently forced to alleviate by operating an algorithmic trader on its own service as a “market-maker”, but that is an issue that will resolve itself as more traders start using the site.Legality is another concern. Icbit is currently not registered anywhere as a financial services provider, and its operators would prefer keeping away from the eyes of the law entirely. The site’s front page features the cryptic phrase “ICBIT is not a place for money laundering, so we are not going to enforce any AML measures like ID verification requirement”, a claim which its operator clarified on a Bitcoin forum with the statement “Indeed it makes me quite worried if a bitcoin exchange becomes a central war place for money laundering practices. Officials should catch offenders at other places before they reach exchanges. Like, when they actually steal money, not when they try to launder.” There is reason to believe that the site will be able to maintain this position for some time. Icbit is still relatively small, and the service itself never handles any financial instruments other than bitcoins and AurumXChange voucher codes, making any attempt to shut the site down through the banking system unlikely. The GLBSE, which is much more prominent, has much higher volumes and has been around much longer than Icbit, still survives with its lax verification policies. However, it remains to be seen how this policy will survive its first major trial, whenever that may come.Icbit is still relatively small, and the high spreads that appear on the futures exchange as a result are a hump that the site will have to get over if it intends to see greater adoption. If it does, then it will be well on the path to becoming a fully fledged replacement for Bitcoinica, hopefully with greater security due to its more safety-oriented design. And if it does not, others will soon take its place. Icbit already has many challengers, and although none of them has managed to overcome the rigorous security and trust requirements of running a margin trading service, it is only a matter of time before one comes along that does. Regardless of which service, or services, become dominant in the end, one thing is clear: having been introduced to it once with Bitcoinica, margin trading is a service of which the community is unwilling to let go.",

    "text": "Laying rest to one and a half weeks of suspense, yesterday pirateat40, the pseudonymous operator of the Bitcoin Savings and Trust investment scheme, has officially announced that he is in default1. BST was a high-yield investment scheme that opened in November 20112and offered its customers interest rates of up to 7% per week, claiming to be able to offer such returns by “selling BTC to a group of local people” – ie. arbitrage. Since then, the scheme has grown rapidly, and Pirate claims3(and independent estimates agree) that over 500,000 BTC, or $7 million USD at the time, were deposited in BST at its peak.For months, the main question that has been asked about the scheme is: is it a legitimate investment? Proponents argue that it is, and justify Pirate’s pseudonymity and secrecy as being necessary to both protect him and prevent others from replicating and diluting the effctiveness of his business model, while detractors believe that Pirate’s unwillingness to further elaborate on the sources of his income is a sign that these underlying sources do not exist at all; in short, that BST is a Ponzi scheme. A third possibility is that BST is itself a pass-through for another Ponzi scheme, such as Sergey Mavrodi’s MMM-2011, although that possibility has become a remote one since MMM defaulted in June and BST continued operating for two months afterwards.The first shock to BST came on August 14, when Pirate lowered the maximum interest rate on his accounts from 7% to 5%4. Whether the scheme was legitimate or not, it was clear to everyone that an effective interest rate of 3313% was unsustainable and Pirate would have to reduce interest rates at some point. And, at some point this summer, the time finally came. At first, Pirate tried to continue his prior rate of growth and keep attracting new investors by attempting to increase investors’ confidence in himself; he announced on July 25that he, under a newly disclosed supposed real name of “Trendon Shavers”, would be attending Defcon in person on July 27-29, and invited investors and curious Bitcoin users in general to meet him in public – “look at a pirate, eye to eye if you dare”, the forum thread read. There have been no confirmed reports that anyone actually saw Pirate at Defcon, but the announcement alone restored confidence at least for a short time. However, even then, BST was simply growing too large and too quickly to last, and on August 14, Pirate was forced to contain his growing debts by shifting down his gears. However, Pirate’s measure utterly failed in its intent; as Pirate himself describes6, “In a perfect world this would allow me to hold more coins in reserve outside the system, but instead it only exponentially increased the amount of withdrawals overnight causing mass panic from many of my lenders.” And thus, on August 17, Pirate was forced to finally shut down.Since then, following the tradition started by the July 11 Bitcoinica thief donating 100 BTC to a claims fund7, Pirate has paid back 106.92 BTC8to one of his depositors, and has only been claiming to make progress toward repaying any others. At first, Pirate promised that all BST depositors would be paid back including interest up to the last hour – a promise which many pointed out would be very difficult to fulfill even for a legitimate business, as he would be accruing over $50,000 USD of new debt every day, but many believed that he would be able to manage the feat. On August 28, however, Pirate announced that he would not be able to pay back his depositors after all, and that he was officially in default1. He has nevertheless made vague promises that depositors would be partially paid back, requiring operators of so-called “Pirate pass-through” bonds on the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange to report a list of their customers9to Pirate by Friday if they want to be refunded.The consequences of this are far-reaching. Almost immediately after Pirate announced BST’s closure, the Bitcoin price ended its three-month long rally after briefly spiking up to a one-year high of $15.4 and began a precipitous decline, losing slightly over half its value over three days9before recovering to what appears to be a stable level at $10-$11. It is unclear if a Pirate default is good or bad for the Bitcoin price; on the one hand, it reduces confidence in Bitcoin as a whole, while on the other hand, it means that many wealthy depositors suddenly have far fewer bitcoins than they thought they would have, and would thus need to buy more (or sell less) to compensate. Many bets have also been made10,11over whether Pirate would pay back; these bets have not yet closed, as the deadline for Pirate to pay in full is still over one week away. In the long term, it remains to be seen how this incident changes both the public attitude on the outside to both Bitcoin itself and the financial freedom that it offers and how the Bitcoin community will perceive any new lucrative Bitcoin investment, legitimate or not, that presents itself in the future. For now, many are relieved that this chapter in the Bitcoin community’s life is finally drawing to a close.A more detailed version of this article will appear in an upcoming issue of Bitcoin Magazine in print.Sources",

    "text": "As many have predicted was an inevitable future, the man known only as Pirateat40 on bitcointalk.org announced the closure of his investment service, the Bitcoin Savings & Trust, earlier today, citing complications in performing larger transactions as the primary reason. The interest rate given to investors was a staggering 7% per week for large investments, a number that could not have been sustainable in the long run and could only be matched in non-Bitcoin economies with ponzi schemes and similar cons.Although it remains unconfirmed as of yet whether Pirateat40’s proposed investment service was or was not in fact a ponzi, the truth will undoubtedly be more clear next week: he has promised to pay back all of his users within a week, and begin those paybacks starting on Monday. We will find out very quickly whether he has the ability to repay all customers, or if those words were the last we’ll ever hear from him.After briefly touching $15/BTC prior to the news of the shutdown, the market had a stark reaction when the announcement was made, as it is fairly well known that deposits with pirate exceeded at least several hundred thousand BTC, if not more, and could be used to greatly affect the Bitcoin price. Within an hour, the price per bitcoin had dropped to almost $10 before stabilizing around $12.50. Two trains of thought dominate recent market discussions: either Pirateat40 will be able to repay all of his investors, flooding the market with BTC that had been previously locked up and driving the price down as some of the investors cash out, or Pirateat40 was running a ponzi and will simply run with the currently-held funds, leaving no potential for cashout in the immediate future, and potentially more buying, as investors seek to replace the lost BTC. Even the latter scenario does legitimize a price drop; if such a large con was to be revealed, it could shake confidence in Bitcoin considerably, and that uncertainty could lead to further price drops.Many investors in the program shared the belief that it was a ponzi scheme, but openly admit to investing in it (or pass-throughs made for smaller investors) anyhow. If reinvested, the return on investment at 7% interest rate would mean a doubling of one’s account balance about every 10 weeks. And, given that the service has been running since early November 2011, a user could have conceivably seen an increase in their account balance of 700%. These extravagant returns attract investors who believe they will be able to pull out of a scheme before it collapses, even though they might know it is a scheme to begin with.Keep a watchful eye on bitcointalk.org come Monday - it should be very telling as to whether investors will be seeing a bitdime of their money back or not.Do you expect Pirateat40 to pay back his customers?

    "title": "One of the lesser known features of Bitcoin is that the private keys, which form the basis for a Bitcoin",
    "text": "One of the lesser known features of Bitcoin is that the private keys, which form the basis for a Bitcoin address, do not need to be generated randomly; instead, one can generate a Bitcoin address, fully compatible with Blockchain.info’s wallet and Armory, using nothing but standard easily available cryptographic tools and a password of your choice. If you ever lose access to your client or account, or if you are using a brain wallet and don’t ever store your wallet electronically or on paper at all, you can always fully recover the ability to use your address simply by repeating the procedure you used to create it with the same password.The trick is a simple one: open this web page or this new tool by Ubaidullah Butt in a new tab in private browsing mode (Shift+Ctrl+N in Chrome and Shift+Ctrl+P in Firefox), turn off your internet connection for security reasons, input the password into the larger textbox at the top, hit “Calculate SHA-256 hash,” and copy it down somewhere. Close the tab, turn the internet back on, and follow your wallet’s instructions for importing your own private key. It just so happens that the output of the SHA256 hash function is in exactly the right format to be a private key under Bitcoin’s elliptic curve cryptography system. You don’t have to use online tools to find the SHA256 hash; on Linux, for example, the command echo -n 'password' | sha256sum | grep -o '[0-9a-f]*' does the same thing and is more secure.However, while this is a convenient way of reliably generating addresses, it is important to be extremely careful when using it. Recently, a Bitcoin user attempted a dictionary attack against addresses generated in this way, generating addresses from millions of passwords found in a leaked password database from an unrelated source, and ended up randomly guessing the backdoor keys to addresses that, at their peak, contained a total of seven bitcoins. Of course, this sum is a small one, but as the number of Bitcoin users increases and alternative wallet generation strategies become more popular, it will only increase, and there will be more incentive for someone with access to greater computer power to attempt this feat once again. Given that Bitcoin mining companies are developing computers thousands of times faster and more efficient at the task of calculating SHA256 hashes than anything else available today, they will be able to get much further.So, how can you protect yourself? The most basic option is to use a strong password, and not something like 12345678, to secure your private key. However, the stronger the password the harder it will be to both input and remember, so stronger passwords, while being a necessity, need to be complemented with other strategies. One option is to use a hash function deliberately designed to run slowly. One popular option is bcrypt, of which a single hash takes a few hundred milliseconds to calculate. The wait is an insignificant one when you’re trying to create or recover your address yourself, but becomes prohibitive to any attacker wishing to attempt hashes by the millions. The simplest implementation to use is python-bcrypt; after installing it, open a Python console, type import bcrypt followed by x = bcrypt.hashpw ('password',bcrypt.encode_salt('0000000000000000',12)) (you can replace the empty salt with a second password if you wish). You will then need to apply SHA256 to the result to get the correct format for private key insertion, but what matters is that you have a very slow function forming the bulk of the generation process. Another possibility is to apply SHA256 a hundred thousand times (the python for which is import hashlib, followed by x = 'password', then for i in range(100000): x = hashlib.sha256(x).hexdigest() and finally print(x)) or, for added security against specializing mining computers, apply SHA512 a hundred thousand times instead and then only take the first half of the output.However, there is also another option. Consider how password authentication works for normal websites: logging in to one’s Google, Twitter or Bitcointalk account does not simply require typing in a password to authenticate yourself, you must type in a username as well. And for good reason, too – rather than being able to pull off a dictionary attack and make off with thousands of accounts in one fell swoop, attackers are forced to try every password in their dictionary for each and every username that they come across, and they may not even have the database of usernames to work with. The solution to the Bitcoin address cracking problem is thus to replicate the username/password model for your private key. Rather than hashing “password”, I might hash “vbuterin:password” instead. As long as you remember your username and don’t have a complex convention for stringing the two together, this doesn’t harm memorability at all, but does severely hamper an attacker’s ability to unlock your address for his own use.Creating your own addresses deterministically from a password is a powerful feature, and has many unique and powerful uses. It allows you to use your Bitcoin wallet with the reassurance that, even if you lose everything you have, you will still be able to recover it. It allows you to use Bitcoin without relying on any software except at transaction time. Combined with other advanced elliptic curve mathematical techniques, it can also be used to generate complex hierarchical wallets with a root password. However, passwords have their risks, and when money is at stake, doubly so. For this reason, it is important to understand passwords’ limitations, and use them with a healthy dose of prudence.",

    "text": "If you have been following Bitcoin closely the past couple of days, you may have heard about MtGox trading bitcoins at $1B a piece.Though all evidence of the event has been erased from Mt.Gox and BitcoinCharts history, Mt.Gox briefly showed a high of $1B per Bitcoin on the 9th of August, 2012. Market depth on the ask chart was also incredibly low, showing a fraction of what might be considered normal.Some users speculated that Mt.Gox’s live data stream had somehow been hacked to display incorrect data. Ultimately, it was confirmed by Natalie on the Mt.Gox support team to be the result of a technical glitch, not a hack or any other sort of malicious behavior. Reportedly, Mt.Gox’s creator MagicalTux stated that a 0-amount trade “triggered an old bug in the trade engine we’ve been tracking for a while”.Witnesses to the incident uploaded a variety of screenshots highlighting the vast discrepancy from normal trading operations (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).The full statement posted by Mt.Gox’s support team is shown below.[divider]Hello Mt.Gox Users,Trading was unavailable for a short period of time today. There were invalid trades taking place as well as trade orders that could not be cancelled. Therefore we had to halt the trading engine and consequently, most ask orders were cancelled.However, we have resolved this issue and trading has now resumed. Invalid trades have been cancelled and trade orders can now be cancelled. Users who have had their ask orders cancelled are kindly requested to place their orders again.We apologize for the inconvenience caused and we will make every effort to prevent this from happening again in the future. Thank you for your continued support to Mt.Gox.UPDATE: After investigating, we found out that the issue is likely due to an old piece of code in the trade engine that checks for bid/ask cross (i.e. negative spread). This piece of code would check for bids and asks differences, but did not make sure that both were in the same currency.To prevent this bug issue from recurring, we have placed some extra checks to halt trading automatically should a similar issue happen again. Thank you once again for your kind understanding in this matter.UPDATE 2: It appears that some new trade engine features that were rolled into production earlier today caused this bug to become possible. We have now found the exact cause and resolved this bug.We now are 100% confident that today’s problem was due to a technical glitch and we would like to assure that it was not caused by any malicious attempts.[divider]Image Copyright 2006 (CC BY-SA 2.0) hashashin",

    "text": "As was previously reported, Bitcoinica was shut down on May 11th, 2012 as a result of a hacker stealing 18,547 BTC (then worth about $92,500) from the service’s hot wallet. Two months later, while the service was in the midst of rebuilding user data to issue refunds, a malicious entity was able to gain access to Bitcoinica’s MtGox account and withdraw 40,000 BTC (then worth about $310,000) and $40,000 USD.After Zhou Tong, the creator of the service, sold Bitcoinica to Wendon Group, the Bitcoin Consultancy was hired to be responsible for maintaining the service. Once the service was shut down, they were also responsible for refunding the service’s users. Recently, the three members of the Bitcoin Consultancy have allegedly ceased all communications, and have stopped refunding users entirely. Due to this deafening silence from the Bitcoin Consultancy, Tihan Seale has stepped up, and begun the process of liquidation via receivership in New Zealand. Seale has claimed responsibility to Wendon Group for monitoring past investments, which evidently can include cleanup of failed investments.Evidence made public by a variety of Bitcoin users seemed to indicate that Zhou Tong himself was responsible for at least the most recent hack. Within hours of this information coming to light, Zhou Tong claimed to identify the third hacker instead as Chen Jianhai, a previous business associate of his. After Zhou Tong supposedly confronted Jianhai with evidence of his theft, Jianhai agreed to return at least some of the Bitcoinica funds. Zhou states that he can recover, at most, about $330,000 worth of combined USD and Bitcoins from Jianhai, leaving the users short $42,000.User deposits at Bitcoinica at the time of shut down have been estimated at just over $1M USD of total valuation. With $442,500 of those funds stolen, but 15,000 BTC (currently worth about $140,000) recently returned by Zhou Tong on behalf of Chen Jianhai, 38% of the funds paid out so far, and the $92,500 hack apparently being too much for Bitcoinica to pay out of its own pocket, it seems reasonable to estimate that Bitcoinica only holds around $390,000 to $490,000 in remaining assets with which the receiver of a liquidation might be able to pay back to users of the service. Assuming this estimate holds true, it would mean that users of the service could expect, at the maximum, to receive around 75%-80% of their account balances at the time Bitcoinica was shut down. If Zhou Tong is able to recover the additional $190,000 from Chen, it would mean that users of the service could expect, at the maximum, to receive over 95% of their account balances at the time Bitcoinica was shut down. Legal fees or other currently-unknown creditor claims could further erode this eventual payout percentage.Have you been affected by the Bitcoinica debacle? ",

    "text": "Bitfloor, the fourth largest exchange dealing in US dollars, has just announced[1]that it has been hacked, and the service has taken a loss of 24,000 BTC, worth about $250,000 at the time of the theft. As Roman Shtylman, the founder of Bitfloor, describes it, “last night, a few of our servers were compromised. As a result, the attacker gained accesses to an unencrypted backup of the wallet keys (the actual keys live in an encrypted area). Using these keys they were able to transfer the coins. This attack took the vast majority of the coins BitFloor was holding on hand.” As a result, BitFloor has paused all exchange operations and, depending on the effect that this will have on BitFloor’s finances, BitFloor may take one of two options. They may either take the loss and continue running in an attempt to eventually earn the money back or, in the worst case, shut down entirely and begin an account partial refund process out of the available funds.The unencrypted backup that allowed the thief to carry out the attack was made when Shtylman made a manual upgrade earlier and put the data into an unencrypted partition on his disk; Shtylman has so far declined to comment further on the details of the attack, saying that “my current focus is on the future and not the past.” As Bitcoin security experts point out, Bitfloor made not one but two errors that were both necessary to lead to such a severe loss; the first, leaving data stored unencrypted, was an honest and perhaps unavoidable mistake, but it would not have had nearly as much of an effect if there had not also been the second error of leaving so much money in an online-accessible “hot wallet”. Since the Bitcoinica Linode theft, in which an unknown attacker made off with $222,000 worth of bitcoins from Bitcoinica’s hot wallet in March, it has been generally understood that any Bitcoin-holding service should keep the vast majority of its funds in “cold storage”, a term referring to a setup where the private keys never touch any computer that is accessible from the internet.ThomasV, the lead developer behind the Electrum client, lists some security recommendations for Bitcion exchanges here; his seven key points are:Don’t store more bitcoins outside of cold storage than you can afford to lose and remain solvent. This ensures that your business will be able to financially survive a hack.Deposits should be sent to cold storage addresses directly.Transfer from cold storage to hot storage should be manual only.An attacker should not be able to disguise a theft as a series of withdrawals from customers.If a withdrawal request exceeds the amount available on the hot wallet, the customer should have to wait. Receiving coins 24 hours later is better than not receiving one’s coins at all.Clone your database to a place where an attacker cannot irreversibly modify or delete it from the server.Send digitally signed account statements to customers regularly, using a key that is not on the public server.Taking greater care to protect one’s server from being hacked in the first place is of course the best defense. However, any single layer of defense will invariably make mistakes, and sound Bitcoin service security requires a strong and detailed strategy for mitigating losses based on a defense in depth. Not following proper security procedures may mean seeing your prospering Bitcoin business meet a sudden and untimely end. Given the amount of information and experience available on such matters, not taking the most trivial standard precautions may even open one up to liability due to gross negligence. No matter how big, small, young or established your Bitcoin business may be, it is better to be prepared earlier rather than later.Sourceshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=105818.0&action=printpage",

    "text": "An animated short film that informs about the digital currency Bitcoin with typical German humour will be publicly presented in Berlin (Germany) on Thursday, September 6, at 7 PM Central European Time. The premiere’s venue is the Kreuzberg-based bar Room 77 at Graefestraße 77 – the only place in Germany (so far) where you can pay for your snacks and drinks in Bitcoin. Being part of the monthly meeting of the Berlin Bitcoin Community, the film’s producers will present their work and answer questions.“As a German company working for a global market, we have decided to play with our ‘German-ness’ and the stereotypes that come with it”, says Oliver Flaskämper from Bitcoin.de, the Bitcoin market place, which has commissioned the film. “The main characters — a rather moony scientist and his robot — speak English with a heavy German accent and treat things with German accuracy.”“We have produced the film with animators from India whom we met through our international film festival”, explains Aaron Koenig, MD of Bitfilm.com and the film’s director. “Through this connection we can offer high quality for a relatively modest budget. Of course we paid our Indian animators in Bitcoin: the wire transfer only took a few seconds and there were no fees involved.”Bitcoin is a digital, decentralised, peer-to-peer-based currency that works without a central bank and knows no inflation. Security is guaranteed by advanced cryptographic methods. Bitcoin is also a new global payment system, which enables its users to pay globally, for free and anonymously over the Internet, rendering banks, credit card companies and other middlemen obsolete.The market place Bitcoin Germany: http://www.bitcoin.dePress contact: Aaron Koenig (aaron@bitfilm.com)",

    "text": "As of 18:36:30 GMT on August 2nd, Bitcoin broke the $10 price barrier on MtGox for the first time in 2012. Bitcoin closed at $9.35 at the end of the day on July 31st, and, as of 1:54 GMT August 3rd, is currently trading at $10.65, indicating a rise of almost 14% in just two days. The trading price hit a new 2012 high of $11.00 around 22:00 GMT.Some are suspicious of the recent run-up in price over the last two months, and do not believe it will last. The price at the start of 2012 was only $4.72, and, with the current trade price of $10.65, shows a whopping gain of 126% over eight months. Most of that gain was only seen over the most recent two months – June and July – of 2012, amid concerns that this is yet another bubble-based rally, with the potential for a mirroring of the boom and bust of the summer of 2011.Others are more optimistic, giving reasonable explanations for the rally, such as the potential that investors with high net-worth are beginning to invest significant funds into bitcoins, or conducting market trend analysis to legitimize the price increase. The lack of increased activity shown on Google Trends also helps bring security to the idea that the current rally is sustainable, and not a bubble. An increase in Google Trends activity tends to indicate hype, and a rally without hype might indicate a rally with legs to stand on, instead of a rally built on a group of get-rich-quick speculators.While it is certainly impossible to predict the future price of bitcoins, the steady 3-month rally with every week ending at a higher price than the last does seem to bode well for those who believe the rally is sustainable and will continue.[UPDATE]: As of 8:00 PM GMT on August 3rd, Bitcoin is trading at $11.08, continuing the rally with a rise in price of 18.5% in less than 3 days.Are you making bank on the current rally?",

    "text": "Following the success of the first Bitcoin conference in 2011 in Prague, another conference organized by the Bitcoin Consultancy has just finished in London. This conference was much larger than the previous, with hundreds of attendees present, and individuals prominent in a wide variety of fields shows up to speak. A wide range of topics was discussed, ranging from Bitcoin itself to open source projects like mesh networking and 3D printing and even underlying social and political themes.Particularly unprecedented was the level of interest coming in from outside the Bitcoin community itself. Although the last conference in Prague did bring in Pirate Party founder Rick Falkvinge, Russia Today journalist Max Keiser and electronic payments expert David Birch, the amount of interest coming from outside this year was much greater. Almost as many speakers at the conference came from the Linux community as from Bitcoin, and there were many speakers who were heavily involved in both. Other open source projects were also represented, and the conference even featured the founding father of the free software movement itself, Richard Stallman. This level of outside involvement, combined with the highly interactive nature of the conference, created an opportunity for the world of Bitcoin to integrate into the larger free software, cryptography and free culture community as a whole, and paves the way for greater cooperation between all of the various movements that are seeking to use technology to empower the individual in the digital age.Among the speakers were:Richard Stallman – creator of the GNU project, a key precursor to modern GNU Linux operating systems, and world-renowned free software advocateDennis Roio (Jaromil) – long-time activist within the free software movement, and significant contributor to the development of multimedia applications for the Linux platformAmir Taaki – the main organizer of the conferenceBirgitta Jonsdottir – a member of the Icelandic parliament largely responsible for bringing the country to the top of the Press Freedom Index in the world.Tony Gallippi – CEO of BitPay, the Bitcoin merchant platform which handles payment processing for over 1000 Bitcoin-accepting merchantsMike Hearn – the primary developer of BitcoinJ, a Java implementation of Bitcoin, who is also involved in researching the idea of cryptographic contractsCaleb James Delisle – developer of the cjdns mesh networking systemCody Wilson – founder of Defense Distributed, a group that is attempting to design functional 3D printable firearms for self-defenseMihai Alisie – editor-in-chief of Bitcoin Magazine itselfThe Bitcoin Magazine team has taken a large number of pictures and exclusive interviews, and some of these will become available in an upcoming issue of the magazine.",

Roman Shtylman, the founder and operator of Bitfloor, wrote a blog post[2]promising that he is still working to return users Bitcoin funds, but that it was important to get the exchange back up and running quickly so as to not erode confidence in the continuation of the exchange any further.Currently, any Bitcoin balances held prior to the hack are on “hold” status within the exchange. They cannot be traded or withdrawn.The plan to return users funds currently rests on the profitability of the exchange – as profits are generated, Shtylman plans to distribute some or all of them towards releasing the Bitcoin balances currently on hold. Each user will have the same percentage of their balances released any time a dispersal is made.Shtylman also mentioned he was pursuing potential options with investors to pay back users sooner rather than later, though no specific timeline was given in either case.The security of Bitfloor has reportedly been heavily solidified. No longer will any customer funds be risked in a hot wallet on the server – 100% of customer funds will be placed in cold storage. Bitfloor will still operate a hot wallet, but it will only risk its own funds, not any customer funds. The REST API has been bulletproofed with a secondary passphrase to prevent unauthorized withdrawals from customer accounts. Bitfloor’s servers now reside in a PCI-compliant data center, with disk encryption making the drives useless to anyone attempting a theft while physically at the location. And, perhaps most importantly, all backups are now encrypted.Roman ends his blog post with the following message to his customers:“I am committed to keeping Bitfloor alive, strong, and growing for the bitcoin ecosystem. I would like to say thank you to all of the support I have received pressing for the return of Bitfloor and the service it provided. Bitfloor will continue to excel in both service and quality as it goes forward.”Do you have Bitcoin balances on hold at Bitfloor? Do you expect Roman to keep his word and pay them back? Sources:",

    "title": "Last week, the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange, for a long time the leading investment platform in the Bitcoin economy, suddenly",
    "text": "Last week, the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange, for a long time the leading investment platform in the Bitcoin economy, suddenly and unexpectedly shut down.  There has been much speculation about what has happened, as GLBSE founder James McCarthy (Nefario) maintained relative silence on the Bitcoin forums, and fears multiplied that government law enforcement agencies were behind the shutdown. Just like in the Bitcoinica case, there is also a substantial sum of Bitcoin deposits stored with the site, and so thousands of Bitcoin users around the world have a significant financial stake in the matter. In this interview, McCarthy will discuss the reasons behind the GLBSE's shutdown, the historical background to the disagreement with his former business partner and currently most vocal opponent Theymos, and his perspective on the legality of Bitcoin services as a whole.Vitalik: So, to start off, the main question that we're all wondering about is: what happened? Why was the glbse shut down?James: Well, after getting involved with Pirate, I lost nearly all the bitcoin that GLBSE users had left with us.Vitalik: What do you mean \"getting involved with Pirate\"?James: I kid, I kid. So basically, when I started GLBSE bitcoin was still considered very experimental. It wasn't too long after that Pizza had been bought for 10K BTC. And for a long time GLBSE itself was very much a toy. We didn't reach any sort of success until Feb/March this year. I've heard people asking why didn't we involve a lawyer when the whole thing started, but the truth of the fact is that this was just a fun cool project, and it only became an issue when we became succesful. Also, at that time Intersango had just gotten a letter from the FSA stating that they didn't consider bitcoin as currency.Fast forward to just after the Bitcoin2012 conference in London, which was an awesome event with some amazing people. I had just moved to London and the decision was made to make GLBSE a legitimate company. We were succesful enough that it was certainly worth our while getting a solicitor. After spending some time I'd found what I consider to be a pretty good one. This being London, we've got some of the best securities solicitors in the world, so another part of that was my location - I couldn't really find anyone while I was based in China, or even Manchester. So I spoke to the solicitor and explained everything to him, bitcoin, GLBSE, and the community. The solicitor went and spoke to some other people, got a second opinion, and went to the FSA. Keep in mind that this was after BitcoinGlobal had already had a shareholder meeting and the step to become a legit company had been discussed and approved.Fast forward to last week, and the FSA and others finally get back to us. And things have changed. They were now unsure as to what they would consider bitcoin. Regarding the GLBSE, they believed that what was being done is very much a regulated activity. But this isn't the largest problem.Vitalik: You said on IRC that is was anti-money laundering (AML) first, then tax, then the regulations, right?James: Yes. Money laundering and the finance of terrorism became the largest concern. Due to the properties of bitcoin, it's very attractive for criminals, money laundering etc. Also due to the properties of bitcoin, it's especially difficult to detect any relationship between accounts. So, for example, if you put requirements for AML on transactions over a certain size, you have no way to know if smaller transactions are linked. So for AML purposes bitcoin is exceptionally risky.Long story short, the GLBSE was shut down because:a) It was performing a regulated activityb) I, being the operator, would be liable for the lack of AML provisions. Essentially I would go to jail if GLBSE continued to operateVitalik: The exchanges seem to be dealing fine with the AML stuff though, is your situation different?James: Yes and no. All existing bitcoin exchanges that are not doing AML on all accounts (even bitcoin only ones) are at risk. In the event that bitcoin is considered a currency (which is highly likely), all existing regulations would then be retro-actively applied depending on jurisdiction. Also, for bitcoin exchanges who are dealing with bank deposits the depositors are somewhat known - as in, they have to transfer in from and out to a bank account, and those are linked to a persons identity.Vitalik: Would you have to AML all accounts or just those above a certain threshold? Because I don't know any exchange that doesn't let you be anonymous for small values.James: The GLBSE was bitcoin only. With bitcoin, it needs to be AML for all accounts. And that's a risk the exchanges are taking. It's not possible to tell if one bitcoin only account is connected or not to any other. A person could split one bitcoin transaction across several accounts, keeping the amount under the AML required level. In fact, this is what some users were discussing on bitcointalk , specifically to avoid the requirement for AML. That's a big risk for exchanges to take and it grows as the popularity of bitcoin grows.This is not just my opinion, this is what the solicitor has told me, and since it's my neck on the line regarding the GLBSE and all it's activities I'm much more inclined to listen to the solicitor - otherwise, why bother getting one?Vitalik: What about the tax issues?James: Very simply, the tax man will want their cut of bitcoin activity. Right now people might be able to get away with just by saying that their business is that they sold bitcoins, but once the amounts become worth while tax agencies everywhere will start asking how people managed to aquire those coins in the first place, and this is partly where the money laundering side of things comes in as well. Unless you're are doing business with bitcoin anonymously you will have to follow all the existing rules and regulations of the jurisdiction you are based inVitalik: you said that you might try to make a legal exchange in the future. What would have to be done for that?James: The initial plan was to make GLBSE itself a legal entity that met all the regulatory requirements, with the hope being that it would be something we could ease into. But it became very clear that this was not going to be possible. Plan B was to shut down GLBSE and start a new company, which from the begining followed all the rules.Vitalik: And that turned out to be impractical too?James: Not at all. Really I don't have a conclusive answer on that, yet. Things in the non-bitcoin economy take a hell of a lot longer to get done than in Bitcoin land; people were complaining about why GLBSE wasn't able to give them their bitcoin back right away (and started freaking out on the forums, in a large part thanks to theymos), really things don't move that quickly offline.Vitalik: Anyway, what are the difficulties with getting users their money back?James: And I wasn't going to do anything without the legals giving the me go ahead to do so. Users also need to keep in mind that it's only been a little over a week since GLBSE shut down. I'm currently wading through the 800+ closed accounts for returning bitcoin and assets. A lot of that has to be done manually. Also, you can't just withdraw your assets since they're something that existed solely on GLBSE.Vitalik: But isn't transferring assets just a matter of telling the issuer who has how many?James: Not exactly. When signing up users never agreed to have their contact details given to the issuer, and most of the issuers need a bitcoin address for them to payout to. Once the form went up, the whole process for closing your account is very very smooth and simple.Vitalik: OK, you have a form up now, asking for email and BTC address. So, if you're fine with giving your contact details to the issuers, the issuers can contact you by email from there. What happens if you don't want that?James: Then you're choosing not to continue your relationship with your issuer. I'm sure your shares will still exist, but your issuer won't know who you are, so you won't be able to collect them.Vitalik: so what is the plan for BTC deposits, if you're not just sending them immediately?James: As you may be aware, there are internal disputes in Bitcoin Global. I was hoping to get them sorted quickly. Since I don't hold all users funds, but I do hold most of them. I'm not sure exactly how much Theymos holds, but it's not what he publicly stated In July/September I had sent Theymos 3K BTC to be able to top up the hot wallet when I was on the road (I was going to be traveling for a few days). Last I remember he had about 1500BTC. Those were users' deposits.Vitalik: but if you have most of the money, would it be possible to do something like returning half pro rata immediately, and then returning the rest when you can?James: I could probably do that. As I said earlier though, I need to go through the 800+ accounts first. Obviously not all of them, do them in batches. The first batch will be getting their coins either later today or early tomorrow.Vitalik: Anyway, what is the internal situation of the company at the moment? I can see theymos is not really on your side anymore.James: He hasn't been on my side for some time. About 2 months ago, I had made a number of technical changes to GLBSE to bump up the speed. This ended up introducing a vulnerability, which was on the site for all of three days before I had found it and fixed it. It was a parallel programming issue. So the result was one user had discovered this vulnerability and had taken advantage of it. The user had gotten away with about 2500BTC. This was a big hit to GLBSE's profits, but we had enough to handle this. After investigation I'd learned the user had a bitcointalk account, naturally with Theymos being the admin (and a BitcoinGlobal shareholder, as well as treasurer) I went to Theymos, provided him with the proof both in the block chain and from our records, to get the guy's personal details. He flat out refused, under no circumstances would he release that information. At that point I thought that this was it and we'd have to just take the loss.Vitalik: Did he say why he was refusing?James: Said he couldn't trust any information or records from GLBSE, or something along that line.So he was a shareholder of glbse but didn't trust the rest of the company? Sounds like that wasn't the first disagreement.Not just a shareholder, the treasurer. It was the first disagreement over anything GLBSE related. I'd given up my position as a moderator on bitcointalk about a year earler over him allowing someone to be hounded off the forum over their sexuality, it wasn't acrimonious though. So really this incident was the first.Moving on from that, I'd gotten the thief's information through other means about a month later (from the theft) and got him to return all of the funds about 2 weeks ago. No easy task getting the information or getting him to return the coins.Vitalik: Congratulations, I think that deserves a story in itself :)James: Meh. The fact that Theymos was not willing to help with the theft wasn't brought up in the next shareholder meeting. I was going to, but on the news that GLBSE was going to go legit he said that he would resign and sell out. He didn't like the idea, but thats fine. Not a problem with people disagreeing. So he wanted to sell his (very small) share in GLBSE. After that information I thought the point about the theft was moot.Vitalik: Well, I could understand that - he would need to stop being pseudonymous if btc global became an actual company, right?James: Yes, which was fine. This is why they were going to sell their stake in the business, and I was ok with that. But then, he wasn't happy with my choice to remove Goat from GLBSE. And then with the closing of GLBSE, a shareholder meeting happened on the Friday after it was closed. Theymos put forward a motion to remove me as CEO, but it did not even get 30%. It was him along with two others. We're very unhappy with this course of events.So right after he lost the vote (remember, Theymos never invested anything in GLBSE) he made that post on the forum, and he's been on a quest to do as much damage to me and any GLBSE operations ever since. The others who were with Theymos are the ones who have been posting on the forums.I'd explained since the begining of the meeting that if GLBSE continued I would end up in jail. He didn't care. He was perfectly happy for that to happenVitalik: You did say at the conference in London that you were willing to relocate to another country if necessary.James: Yes, but we've not exhausted the options in the UK at all.Vitalik: So you would prefer a tightly regulated, possibly full AML on every issuer and buyer, UK exchange over the status quo someplace in Asia?James: I would prefer to have an exchange/service where real businesses can raise capital for starting or growing without the fear of being arrested.Vitalik: Is it true that the glbse bylaws disallow shutting down the glbse?James: No. The purpose of the bylaws is to maintain and run GLBSE. If GLBSE is to close, then the bylaws have no purpose. Nothing states that GLBSE can't be shutdown.The purpose of this document is to codify the governing bylaws of BitcoinGlobal, whose initial stated purpose is the development and maintenance of the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange trading platform, but whose operations may extend to other areas with approval of the Members.This is what he is using as his main argument. He interprets this as a ban on the shutdown of GLBSE, when it really states that the purpose of BitcoinGlobal is to run and maintain GLBSE. No GLBSE means there is no purpose in BitcoinGlobal. It's on those grounds he had me labelled as a scammer on the bitcointalk forums. He's also put my life in danger by whipping up members of the forum. I've gotten several phone calls usually at 3-4am in the morning with death threats, one of which knew my address. I've only been living in this address a little over a week.Vitalik: So, is there anything else that has happened this past week?James: In terms of the scandals not so much. I've not been talking to anyone else much if anything at all, Bitcoin Global shareholders included. With the exception of the solicitor - since theymos and other shareholders have decided to selectively release information to the forums from the meetings and emails, I need to make sure all angles are covered. As far as the Bitcoin/legal situation, having a trading platform/secondary market where users can re-sell shares or assets they own is pretty much illegal unless you set up a registered stock exchange which would take tens of millions to do. However...Vitalik: A crowd investing service like Prosper?James: That is where we're looking, crowd funding and the regulations around that area. Can there be a second market for that kind of thing? Sure, but that is something thats not going to be exactly legit.In the long term, and speaking more about Bitcoin rather than the GLBSE specifically, if the largest proportion of the bitcoin economy is made up of black market goods and services, it's going to eventually result in govenments around the world shutting down all the exchanges. This equates to economic sanctions on the \"nation\" of Bitcoin. So technically you can't stop people using Bitcoin and trading with it, you can choke off the entry points into the economy. Without exchanges Bitcoin for the average person becomes pretty useless. We're nowhere near the point when bitcoin can be self sustaining exchange free. The more legitimate businesses that use Bitcoin, not only will the overall Bitcoin economy grow in general, but the more difficult it will become for governments to cramp down on the exchanges as it will have a legitimate use.So, I guess that's it. Any more questions?Vitalik: No, I think that's all. Thanks for your time!",

    "text": "For those who have bought or earned their first supply of bitcoins, no matter how large or how small, the first question that often goes through people’s minds is: what can I do with them? The Bitcoin community focuses heavily on the various ways that users can mine, buy, sell, or invest their bitcoins, and it is easy to forget that one of the key purposes of any kind of currency is, ultimately, to be able to spend it. However, Bitcoin does have a substantial underlying economy with a growing number of merchants participating; BitPay alone has over four thousand merchants using their payment processing system, and many more use competing services or manage their own sales platforms. A long, but even still only partial, list can be found on the Trade section of the Bitcoin wiki, featuring businesses offering all kinds of products. Particularly interesting are the low-end offerings; one of the advantages of Bitcoin is that it makes it much easier than almost any other consumer e-commerce system to manage very small amounts of money, and so the Bitcoin community has a number of offerings that take less than a few dollars, or even cents, to get started. No matter how Bitcoin-wealthy or poor you happen to be, the following list will provide an overview of some of the things that you can do with your hard-earned digital cash.$0.01 – $2.5Bitcointip – the Bitcointip Reddit bot allows you to support your favorite contributors on Reddit by tipping them bitcoin. Once you create a Bitcointip account and send your bitcoins to the deposit address, all you need to do is reply to any post with something like “+bitcointip 0.05 BTC”, and the funds will immediately be transferred to the recipient’s account, from which they can then withdraw the bitcoins at any time. If the recipient does not yet have an account, an account will be created for him.Rugatu – Rugatu is a Bitcoin-based paid question-and-answer board. If you have a question that you want answered and are willing to pay ten cents to a few dollars for an answer, simply submit it to Rugatu and deposit your bounty. Once someone provides an answer which you find satisfactory, you will be able to release the bounty to that user.SatoshiDice – if none of the other options in this category satisfy you, you can always gamble for a chance at increasing your supply of bitcoins to a level where you can buy something more respectable. SatoshiDice offers a wide range of probability distributions, returns an average of 98.1% of what players send in, and requires no account to set up – just send bitcoins to one of its addresses, and perhaps you will receive an even larger sum back. See also: Satoshi Circle, Satoshi Roulette.Coindl – the iTunes of the Bitcoin world, Coindl specializes in digital goods. On Coindl, you will be able to find a small but unique collection of songs for 0.001-0.089 BTC each, as well as books, games, art and software. If you do not have that much, some items are even available on a pay-what-you-want basis.$2.5 – $15Bitmit – the Bitcoin-based auction site has products listed for as little as two dollars, and is very easy to use. At the low price range, you will be able to buy electronics like USB keys and headphones, books and, in the digital goods, section, even one-month premium subscriptions to various online services.Ogrr – if you spend a lot of time playing online games, Ogrr is a trading forum that allows you to buy and sell your in-game virtual goods for bitcoin. Ogrr has subforums for a large number of games, including Diablo, World of Warcraft and Runescape.Bitcoin swag – if you want to show off your Bitcoin pride, there are many places that offer you the gear to do just that. BitcoinPride sells T-shirts, BTCTrinkets sells various pins and keychains and CryptoAnarchy offers a large variety of shirts, keychains, magnets and more for sale.Bitcoin Magazine – what better thing is there to spend your bitcoins on than a copy of the Bitcoin Magazine? Each copy of the print edition is sold for $8.88, free shipping included, although if you are looking for past issues you can often find them bundled for even cheaper.Reddit Gold – Reddit’s premium offering offers some extra features on top of the usual Reddit experience, and access for a month can be bought for $3.99VPN services – for less than $10 worth of bitcoins, you will be able to buy a month or two of access to services like ExpressVPN, Mullvad, SecurityKiss, BolehVPN and privateinternetaccess.com, which allow you to route your internet traffic through them to bypass country-wide internet blocking (both Chinese-style censorship and even in some cases country restrictions on services like Hulu and Pandora) and protect your privacy. In fact, Bitcoin is the perfect currency to buy privacy-protecting VPN services; the privacy that it offers, especially when combined with mixing services like that integrated into Blockchain.info’s wallet, ensures that when you are purchasing your anonymity you are anonymous to the provider as well. A more complete list of VPN options can be found here.VPS and domain registration – if you are looking to start your business, one of the first things that you will need is a website, and that usually entails having a domain and a server to serve your website from. Fortunately, Namecheap, VPS6, BitVPS and many more exist to help you get just that – all payable with BTC.OkCupid – it’s a common meme that computer nerds can never find love, but if you’re in that situation you are now one step closer to breaking the trend. OkCupid, a popular online dating site, is now accepting Bitcoin for its $10 per month premium service “A-list”, which offers a number of additional features including no advertising, filtering and better search options.$15 – $100File sharing – Bitcoin now lets you buy premium access to two of the world’s biggest names in online file sharing: Usenet and Mega. Usenet is the world’s oldest widely known internet discussion and file sharing service, with subdivisions called “newsgroups” for hundreds of different topics of discussion and files that are difficult to find anywhere else, and to Usenet can now be bought at bitusenet.com. Mega is a more traditional centralized file upload/download service created by Kim Dotcom, albeit with client-side encryption, and although Mega does have a limited tier of free service it also has multiple levels of premium access, which the officially endorsed bitvoucher.co sells for BTC.Local businesses – a number of cities, particularly in the US and Europe, have at least one local restaurant that accepts Bitcoin. Going to such places offers benefits beyond just the food – it can also be a great way to meet other people who are part of the Bitcoin community.Clothing – CryptoAnarchy, Bitmit, BitcoinPride and others all offer Bitcoin-branded clothing in the 1-2 BTC range, if you wish to take your enthusiasm for Bitcoin to a new, and much more visible, level.Employment – ultimately, you do not even need a third party service to make your bitcoins worthwhile. Bitcoin is a free market composed of people around the world, and if you have a job that needs to be done, whether it’s art, translation or programming, just post it on any Bitcoin forum and you will quickly get people eager to work for your bitcoins so that they can spend them in turn.Domain name hosting – if you want to set up an online presence for your business or even just have a personal website that you fully control, there are plenty of providers who will sell you a domain name for bitcoin. Some providers, like BitDomain.biz, are even willing to work with you if you wish to remain anonymous – something which is impossible for those providers that only accept credit cards.Anything – many large merchants do not officially accept Bitcoin, but the Bitcoin community has come up with a collection of services that allow you to spend bitcoins with them nonetheless. The most popular is Bitspend, which has a form into which you can enter your shipping information and the product URL, which Bitspend’s staff then use to pay for the order with their credit card. There are also more specialized proxies available: BTCBuy offers Amazon, ThinkGeek, Sears, NewEgg, drugstore.com and Barnes and Noble cards from $10 to $350 in value, GamerKeys, which sells many popular PC games for bitcoins and Steambits, a proxy for the gaming service Steam.Home accessories – there are many stores listed on the Trade section of the Bitcoin wiki which offer various electronics, tableware and home appliances, and a large selection of goods can be found on Bitmit as well.$100 – $1000Electronics – the Bitcoin Store, Bitmit, Bitcoinblaster.com and many other sites offer both low-end and high-end, new and used computers, tablets and phones for sale at similar prices to what can be found elsewhere. The Bitcoin Store’s prices are in fact usually even cheaper than leading traditional retailers like Amazon and Newegg, often to the point that it can even be more efficient for those who who have never used Bitcoin before to buy bitcoins through an exchange just to immediately spend them at the Bitcoin Store rather than buying the equivalent goods elsewhere with a credit card.Precious Metals – if you want to convert your bitcoins to precious metals, Amagi Metals or Coinabul is the place to go. Recognized even outside of the Bitcoin community for their reliability and ease of use, these two stores are the easiest way to buy gold and silver coins for BTC. Note that if you want to convert your gold or silver into bitcoins to spend on any of the other options in this chart, Coinabul can do that too. Aside from the bullion sellers, there is All Things Luxury, which offers a large collection of gold and silver jewellery.Travel – if you’re travelling to any city around the world, you can avoid currency exchange difficulties by carrying over your money in the form of bitcoin instead. Several cities have bed-and-breakfasts and taxis that accept Bitcoin, and even for your everyday use, you can always make a deal on Localbitcoins to exchange your bitcoin for local currency when you get there. For those who prefer a more structured tour, Bitcoin-friendly travel companies and private tour guides also exist.Rental – real estate companies such as Finextra in Germany and Fat Property in Houston are now allowing you to pay for rent in BTC, and artists, developers and entrepreneurs in San Fransisco may be interested in 20 Mission, a living community designed for startups.$1000 and aboveThis page is, and will always be, a work in progress, and we would gladly welcome your ideas on what we can add. Your suggestion may appear in an upcoming issue of Bitcoin Magazine.Thanks to everyone in the comments so far for your ideas!",

    "title": "About a month ago, New Hampshire State Representative Mark Warden pushed forward the legitimacy of Bitcoin in two very significant",
    "text": "About a month ago, New Hampshire State Representative Mark Warden pushed forward the legitimacy of Bitcoin in two very significant ways. First, he was the first major political candidate to accept Bitcoin for political donations. This was a significant milestone, both because the regulations around political donations make utilizing Bitcoin a much greater challenge than for any other kind of charity, and because it means that Bitcoin has support “within the government.” Eric Olson, a Libertarian candidate in North Dakota, had been accepting Bitcoin for months before[1], but the Libertarian party, like most other third parties in the United States, is much too small to attract significant media attention. Secondly, when New Hampshire’s Deputy Secretary of State approved the arrangement, the event marked the first official ruling of any kind in favor of Bitcoin’s legality.But in the three weeks since, signs are showing that Mark Warden was not simply the first to reach a milestone; he may well have been the first to break a dam. Less than a month after Warden’s move and weeks after the New Hampshire Secretary of State’s approval, Jeremy Hansen, a professor of computer science and independent candidate, has just announced[2]that he also intends to accept Bitcoin donations. Hansen does not have a political platform of his own – he strongly supports direct democracy, and intends to simply serve as a conduit for direct democracy if he gets elected. Barring constitutional objections, on each bill he would simply vote the way the people want him to. Although, like Olson, Hansen is not a mainstream candidate, unlike Olson he has also managed to get formal legal approval from both the Vermont Attorney General and the Vermont Secretary of State.But Josh Jones, creator of Bitcoin Builder and developer of the custom system which Hansen uses to accept donations, intends for Bitcoin to go even further. He believes that “Bitcoin is perfect for campaign contributions because of its ability to do micro-transactions at low-to-no cost”, and to that end, has offered Hansen’s system to any candidate wishing to accept Bitcoin. “The system up now at http://www.bitcoinbuilder.com/donate/,” he writes, “allows political campaigns to create donation forms in one click that comply with the legal requirements Jeremy and I have identified.” And indeed it does. Going to the link, visitors are immediately presented with a form that allows them to create a donation campaign, whether for political purposes or otherwise, set or modify some basic settings like what personal information to require (the default is name, email, phone and address), click “Start Donation Campaign,” and have a link to a form which anyone can use to donate right away. If other candidates are interested, they now have the tools to start accepting Bitcoin far more quickly – Jones’s form is far easier to set up than even BitPay. The work of determining what kind of donation system works best has already been done by Warden and Jones, and getting approval for each additional state will only be easier with the weight of two established precedents in Bitcoin’s favor.Sources",

    "title": "After the collapse of Bitcoinica six months ago, the business of margin trading, a service which at Bitcoinica’s peak attracted",
    "text": "After the collapse of Bitcoinica six months ago, the business of margin trading, a service which at Bitcoinica’s peak attracted a trade volume almost as large as that of MtGox itself, disappeared from the Bitcoin ecosystem almost entirely. Since then, there have been a number of disparate efforts to bring margin trading back. Almost as soon as Bitcoinica fell, a company named RingCoin announced Kronos.io, a product which looked like it could be a superior upstart competitor that would not suffer from the security faults of its predecessor. However, kronos.io was never completed, and RingCoin is now defunct. Another alternative was icbit.se, a service which has been trading options between BTC and USD, gold and even crude oil for months, and is still active now, but has not had anything close to the level of success reached by Bitcoinica. Finally, there is the Bitcoin stock exchange MPEX, which also offers USD/BTC options for trade.Aside from these three, a number of other minor attempts have been made, some of which turned out to be fraudulent, and none of which successfully brought back what the Bitcoin ecosystem lost when Bitcoinica fell.The idea behind margin trading is simple. If you have an account at a traditional Bitcoin exchange like BitStamp of MtGox, you have two balances: a BTC balance and a USD balance (or perhaps a CAD or EUR balance, or some other currency, depending on what country you are in). Apart from depositing and withdrawing, the only operation available to you is trading one currency for another, reducing the BTC balance by some value and increasing the USD balance by that value multiplied by the current price (or vice versa), also paying a small spread and commission. If you are participating in the exchange as a trader, your goal is to convert to BTC before the exchange rate goes up, and convert to USD before the exchange rate goes down, slowly increasing the net worth of your account over time. The benefit to society from such trading is that it stabilizes markets; a successful trader who earns a profit will, in doing so, prop up the valleys and dampen the peaks of the Bitcoin price, ensuring a more stable exchange value for all. Margin trading services add only one feature to this model: the ability to have one of your balances go negative. That is, if you have 10 BTC and 0 USD, and you are really sure that BTC will go up in the near future, you can buy more BTC on the market, and have a balance of, say, 15 BTC and -$55 USD. The attraction of doing such a thing is simple: if the value of a bitcoin shoots up by 10%, then the net worth of your account will grow by more than 10%. However, there is also a risk: if the value drops by 10%, the net worth of your account will drop by more than 10% as well. If you are really unlucky and the price drops by so much that the net worth of your account becomes negative, then your balances are “liquidated” and you lose everything. The ratio between the change in BTC price and the change in the net worth of your account is called the leverage, and there is typically a maximum leverage, which in the Bitcoin economy has historically been about 10:1.This is the service that Bitcoinica was providing for eight months before its shutdown in May. Now, it looks like another competitor is positioning itself to take this niche: Bitfinex. The service that BitFinex is providing offers a number of advantages over what Bitcoinica provided. First, the security that they claim to be offering is much higher. Unlike Bitcoinica, whose online-accessible “hot wallet” was hacked for $222,000 in March, Bitfinex plans to have no hot wallet at all, processing withdraws manually at the end of each day. The API keys that they use to deal with exchanges will be limited to trading, and will not have the ability to withdraw, averting a mistake which proved ruinous to Bitcoinica when $320,000 was stolen from their MtGox account in July. In terms of account security, Bitfinex once again beats Bitcoinica, offering two-factor authentication right from the start.More interestingly, BitFinex will trade with a number of exchanges, offering spreads lower than those that can be found at any single one, and there is even the option to make a special “routed order” which will never be passed on to exchanges and instead attempt to eat up an opposing BitFinex order. As exchanges are bypassed, the fee for taking this option will only be 0.1%. Finally, just like Bitcoinica in the later months of its operation, an interest rate system is in place with which users can deposit money and earn an interest of currently 16.5% annually in exchange for providing liquidity.However, there is also much to worry about. The BitFinex source code is based on the notoriously insecure Bitcoinica source code that was leaked in July, and one forum poster, Davout, found that one could use one of the same exploits against Bitfinex that worked against Bitcoinica when it was still operational: set the leverage to 10,000, put in a small amount of money, and wait for the price to move. If it moves even slightly down, the leverage effect ensures that the result will be immediate liquidation. If it moves up, however, the size of the account balance will jump up by ten thousand times the increase in the underlying BTC price, securing a profit margin far above 100%. Other issues, such as the use of floating point numbers (a form of binary scientific notation typically used to represent non-integer values in computers but known for their inexactness when trying to store decimal values) to store account balances, were also discovered. Even though Bitfinex’s creator Raphael Nicolle claims that “Bitfinex is now much more powerful and robust”, the discovery of such flaws so soon after Bitfinex’s beta release bodes ill for such an otherwise promising startup.Secondly, the “no hot wallet” setup that is at the core of BitFinex’s design, although admirable, has a problem of its own: if, over the course of one day, it happens that users are consistently buying more BTC than selling, or vice versa, then in order for BitFinex to be able to honor all of its users’ positions it needs to step in and act as the counterparty to some of its users itself. This kind of setup is known as a bucket shop and is heavily frowned upon (and in many jurisdictions even illegal) because it creates perverse incentives – the shop can potentially make an order on the markets large enough to significantly bump the price up, liquidate all of its users who had opposite positions at high leverage, and keep all of their funds as profits. Even if Nicolle does not want to create a bucket shop, given a no hot wallet setup Bitfinex may have no choice but to periodically temporarily become one.Also questionable is the founder, Raphael Nicolle, himself. Fortunately, this is not another attempt at an anonymously run financial service; Nicolle has provided a LinkedIn profile which confirms his involvement in BitFinex, and has plans to register the company when they settle on the best jurisdiction to locate their service. However, he was also involved in the Bitcoin investment scheme craze that had reached its peak in the Bitcoin community this summer, strongly supporting the (then only suspected) Bitcoin Ponzi scheme operator Pirateat40 in August, stating “now that Pirateat40 closed down his operatations thanks to all the fud that was going on and growing on the forum, I expect everyone that spreads this fud, accused and insulted Pirate and the people that supported him to apologize.” He even tried to open a 2%-per-week investment scheme of his own in September. Of course, all this does not nearly suggest that Nicolle was, and is now, attempting to defraud; 2% weekly interest rates, or 180% annual, are actually quite reasonable in a volatile startup economy where Bitcoin itself can easily rise and fall by much more than a factor of 2.8 within the same period. His endorsement of Pirateat40 too may simply have been a misguided expression of group solidarity and his ardent support of capitalism. However, for those who are concerned above all with the safety of their money reputational factors are an important consideration, and Nicolle may do well to find some trusted members of the Bitcoin community as partners if he wishes to quickly secure the community’s trust.Perhaps BitFinex will indeed do what Bitcoinica, Kronos.io, and Icbit could not and provide a secure and lasting margin trading service for the masses. But perhaps this platform too will fail in the same way that Bitcoinica did. When Zhou Tong first released Bitcoinica to the public, he received what proved to be a prophetic reply on the Hacker News message boards: “systems that work with money are attacked hard and often, by intelligent skilled people. Spectacular failure is your destiny if you don’t work very hard to prevent it. Spectacular failure may be your destiny even if you do work very hard to prevent it. You should plan accordingly.” The quote applies just as strongly in this case. Nicolle is clearly trying hard to create a strong security setup for BitFinex so that it can avoid the security pitfalls that so ruinously struck Bitcoinica earlier this year. Given some of his security decisions, however, the question is: will he be able to?",

    "text": "Roger Ver, known in the Bitcoin community for operating Memory Dealers and for a number of efforts marketing Bitcoin including a billboard and a radio ad, has announced that he is starting a new Bitcoin business: an all-purpose electronics store. The Bitcoin Store is already online, with thousands of products available for sale ranging from three dollar USB keys to thirty thousand dollar servers and everything in between. Of course, Bitcoin electronics stores are nothing new; Bitcoin Blaster has been selling electronics for bitcoins for months now, and Bitcoin stores with even larger offerings, such as the now-defunct Bitcoin World Market, have been popping in and out of existence for over a year. However, the Bitcoin Store has one feature that gives it staying power that no other such business has ever had in the Bitcoin world: it is cheaper than the competition.Roger Ver’s announcement provides some examples: a 60-inch TV which can be found on Amazon for $1,397.99, NewEgg for $1,437.99 but on the Bitcoin Store costs only $1,367.48, a laptop whose Amazon price of $2,266.66 and NewEgg price of $2,317.00 is beaten considerably by the Bitcoin Store’s price of $1985.51, and a laser printer which costs $202.01 on Amazon, $204.99 on NewEgg but $175.66 on the Bitcoin Store. As for how the Bitcoin Store manages to do this, the answer is simple; Roger Ver writes “we have partnered with the worlds largest wholesale technology distributor, and avoid traditional merchant fees because we accept Bitcoin only.” Such relationships are difficult to come by; Roger Ver was only able to achieve this because he already operates Memory Dealers, a store which has an annual sales volume of over $10 million USD (although, Ver laments, almost none of it in Bitcoin). “It remains to be seen,” Ver adds, “if Bitcoinstore.com will be able to have enough volume to keep all the distributors happy and willing to give good prices.”Shipping is currently set at a fixed $4.99 USD for orders within the United States (although the fee is waived for orders above $100), and a variable fee based on destination and weight internationally. Even at this rate, domestic shipping is usually cheaper than that available at Amazon and NewEgg, where shipping on low-cost products is often even higher; a sample selection of adapters on NewEgg shows shipping costs ranging from $6.99 to $9.99. There are places in the Bitcoin economy where shipping is even cheaper. Some goods on Bitmit offer even expedited international shipping for as little as $2. However, no other bitcoin business offers nearly as expansive an array of goods as the Bitcoin Store does. If volume picks up, even the $4.99 shipping fee may disappear. “Ideally, everything will have free shipping inside the USA,” Ver writes, “but it will take a little more work. If I can guarantee $300K in sales a month, then I can do it for sure.” Even without that much volume, there is a possibility, although far from a certainty, that shipping costs will soon come down to $1.99 regardless.For now, the Bitcoin Store is still in a beta stage, with a $1,000 minimum on purchases. The user interface is still being finalized, and international shipping costs are currently very high; some report costs as high as $90. However, if everything goes according to plan all of these issues will soon be resolved. The minimum is only there to keep usage down while the site is still being finalized, and Jon Holmquist expects that it will be removed within the next few days. The Bitcoin Store team also reassures potential customers that the current international shipping costs should be disregarded, and much cheaper options will be introduced once the rest of the site is complete.Because of its low prices, if the Bitcoin Store is successful, it represents another chance for a large increase in Bitcoin adoption in the near-to-medium term future. The Bitcoin Store’s prices are in fact low enough for it to even be worth it to pay the 5% fee to buy bitcoins from BitInstant to shop there rather than using a credit card, so the potential audience of the site extends far beyond those who already have bitcoins to spend. Like all Bitcoin businesses, the main challenge that the Bitcoin Store will have to face is marketing. Roger Ver and Jon Holmquist are already marketing the site on all channels within the Bitcoin community as well as social media channels, but a much stronger and concerted marketing effort will be required for the store to achieve the sales volume that it needs. If it does, this may be one of the best things to happen to Bitcoin yet.",

    "text": "A number of prominent businesses in the Bitcoin community are participating today in the first promotional event of its kind in Bitcoin’s history: Bitcoin Friday. To celebrate the second anniversary of the Bitcoin project being registered on Sourceforge in November 2010, MtGox, BitPay, WalletBit, Coinabul, PrivateInternetAccess, BitMit and many smaller shops and services both online and offline (complete list here or here if the first link is inaccessible) are offering discounts on their products just for today.The event was originally conceived and organized by Jon Holmquist, head of marketing at the precious metals seller Coinabul which recently celebrated its first anniversary. The intent was simple: to introduce more people to Bitcoin and to reinvigorate consumer spending from existing Bitcoin users; as Holmquist wrote, “With news reports of 78% of bitcoins not being spent, we need to do something.”Among the established Bitcoin businesses offering sales are:Coinabul offering $1 off silver and $10 off goldMtGox halving exchange fees for 48 hoursThe merchant platform WalletBit is reducing processing fees by half (0.89% -> 0.445%) and BitPay is waiving theirs entirely.The Bitcoin Store offering free shipping for purchases over $100Also from the elctronics department, Bitcoin Blaster and wtcr.ca are offering up to 15% off and 30% off, respectively.Private Internet Access, Mullvad and CryptIP all offering about 25% off on their VPN offeringsCanadian Bitcoins is offering 10% off on buying bitcoins (effectively almost 100% off of their commission) for cash in the mail.BitBrew and Bitcoin Coffee offering 15% and 20% off, respectively.SatoshiDice donating all of today’s profits to the Bitcoin FoundationThere are also several surprise deals that have appeared today. The startup car manufacturer WIKISPEED, whose cars can drive 100 miles on a single gallon of gas (that’s 2.14 L per 100 km) while remaining completely street-legal is offering 20% off on its cars and T-shirts for one day. If anyone is thinking of ordering a WIKISPEED car, by buying today they can save thousands of dollars. Also, Bitcoin Pride, selling Bitcoin promotional clothing, has chosen today as the day to announce their grand opening, offering free shipping for anyone who buys today.Local businesses too have joined in the sale, and to them Bitcoin Friday is more than a sale; it’s also an opportunity to bring their local Bitcoin communities together. Room 77, “the restaurant at the end of capitalism” in Berlin, is offering 23% off on everything and free drinks to people paying in Bitcoin, but has also invited anyone to come to a day and night where anyone can learn about Bitcoin, get help getting software installed and, obviously, buy bitcoins. Bitcoin users outside of Berlin with friends there are encouraged to invite them to visit and pay for them in Bitcoin remotely. Room 77 is also announcing Bitcoin Kiez (Bitcoin Neighborhood), a project to help other businesses in the neighborhood start accepting Bitcoin as well. Joerg Platzer writes [German] that “at the end of Bitcoin Friday one will be able to not only eat and drink for Bitcoin in the Graefekiez area at Room 77, but also, for example, munch at Primo Maggio Pasta or slurp fabulous cocktails in the bar… In the next few weeks the experiences of the participants in this public beta phase will be taken into account to further adapt and optimize the Bitcoin infrastructure. During this time more retail stores and restaurants will announce their acceptance of Bitcoin to the point that in December you will be able to go shopping for Christmas gifts and eat in many cafes and restaurants and pay for everything in Bitcoin. We are calling it ‘an alternative local currency with global reach'”.And, of course, Bitcoin Magazine itself is participating in the Bitcoin Friday bitcoinfriday.com sale with a 25% off limited time offer. You can buy issues #2 #3 #4 for only 20.00$ at bitcoinmagazine.com/subscribe.",

    "text": "Today, WordPress, an extremely popular blog hosting site and framework and the 22nd most accessed site in the world, has announced that they are going to be accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment. The press release reads: “at WordPress.com, our mission is making publishing democratic — accessible and easy for anyone, anywhere. And while anyone can start a free blog here, not everyone can access upgrades (like going ad-free or enabling custom design) because of limits on traditional payment networks.” The main reason why WordPress has decided to start accepting Bitcoin is that a core part of WordPress’s mission has always been promoting freedom of information, and Paypal and credit card companies’ restrictive policies prevented users from buying WordPress’s services in exactly those countries where they were needed most. “PayPal alone blocks access from over 60 countries,” the release continues, “and many credit card companies have similar restrictions. Some are blocked for political reasons, some because of higher fraud rates, and some for other financial reasons. Whatever the reason, we don’t think an individual blogger from Kenya, Haiti, Cuba, or Iraq should have diminished access to the blogosphere because of payment issues they can’t control. Our goal is to enable people, not block them.”Another argument which WordPress did not mention is anonymity. Many bloggers that operate in restrictive regimes do so using pseudonyms for their own protection, and traditional payment methods like credit cards and PayPal are unusable for those bloggers because they expose the payer’s physical identity. Bitcoin, on the other hand, offers its users a large degree of anonymity, giving bloggers, dissidents or simply people trying to live their lives in authoritarian regimes a much greater chance at evading persecution.Aside from going ad-free and custom design, the paid services that WordPress offers include the ability to use WordPress on your own domain name, buy extra storage, customer service offers like a guided transfer of a blog from wordpress.com to self-hosting and even a wide variety of premium themes. However, it is important to note that not everything will be purchaseable for BTC immediately; domains and individually purchased themes (ie. bundles are fine) will not be accepting Bitcoin payments for a while. Nevertheless, WordPress promises to make Bitcoin available as a payment medium for all products “within two or three months.”As a content-publishing platform, WordPress is already a very attractive choice for Bitcoin users. There are many e-commerce plugins for WordPress, and one of them offers support for BitPay. As a result of WordPress’s ease of use, Bitcoin Magazine itself uses WordPress as its content publishing back-end. For those who are not yet Bitcoin users, WordPress provides yet another reason to become one. WordPress is a rapidly growing platform, with over 100,000 new blogs created daily, and is showing no signs of slowing. And, more recently, WordPress is being used for more than just blogs. Thanks to its extendable plugin-based infrastructure, WordPress is being used for company websites, news sites, social networks and even in e-commerce applications. Being the 22nd most popular site in the world, WordPress is by far the largest website that had started accepting Bitcoin to date (although by financial size it is arguably beaten by Wuala‘s parent company LaCie), and its acceptance will hopefully provide confidence to many other large businesses that may be contemplating accepting Bitcoin but so far have not been willing to be the ones to make the first move. Now that WordPress has given the green light, potential adopters like Reddit, and perhaps many others that we have not even heard were considering accepting Bitcoin, may be soon to follow.",

    "text": "A few hours ago, a poster on the Bitcointalk forum announced that he was able to successfully reverse an unconfirmed transaction against the popular Bitcoin gambling site SatoshiDice. The attacker’s strategy was simple. First, he sent a 0.25 BTC bet against SatoshiDice with no transaction fees, which he lost. Immediately after receiving the notification of his loss from SatoshiDice, he sent another 0.25 BTC transaction to himself – this time with a transaction fee, encouraging miners to confirm the second over the first. However, this strategy as is turned out to be unsuccessful, and so the attacker was forced to introduce another tactic: make the transaction “spammy”. The standard Bitcoin client has a number of rules about accepting transactions that take up a large amount of disk space as one of its measures to prevent people from sabotaging Bitcoin by filling the blockchain with hundreds of gigabytes of transactions, and a general principle is that transactions which deviate from the model of having only a small number of standard inputs and outputs are much less likely to get accepted quickly, or in some limited cases even propagated, without fees. So the attacker deliberately made his second attempt a 0.20 BTC transaction which split up the funds into twenty inputs of 0.01 BTC each, and then attempted to overwrite the transaction with a 0.20 BTC transaction to himself with a generous 0.004 BTC fee. This time, the attempt worked. The mining pool BTC Guild confirmed the second transaction over the first, and the attacker’s original loss disappeared forever.It is very important to note that this does not undermine the security of Bitcoin as a whole, outside of a very limited number of applications. There are two forms of “confirmation” in the Bitcoin system. The first, which takes about two to five seconds to complete, is simple network propagation; a valid transaction will find its way through the Bitcoin network and make its way to the node controlled by the merchant. The second, which takes about ten minutes, is a block confirmation; here, the miners that maintain the Bitcoin network place the transaction in a block and perform a proof of work computation on the block, which takes a massive amount of computing power to forge. Most Bitcoin-accepting businesses wait for one block confirmation before releasing the product, and this attack does nothing against transactions that have a block confirmation. In the case of vendors selling physical goods and online services, a fraudulent customer’s product can easily be cancelled even hours after the original notification of payment is made. In the case of consumable digital goods like gift codes and wireless refills, this is not the case, but even there the process of sending the code to the customer typically takes up to 30 minutes, so providers either already check for one confirmation or could easily be patched to do so without adding much inconvenience. For usability purposes, the current paradigm of instant confirmations can even still, from the customer’s point of view, appear to remain in place; the instant confirmation still performs its function of reassuring the customer that the transaction has successfully reached the merchant just fine. Waiting an extra ten minutes is a process that can simply happen behind the scenes.Surprisingly, digital download stores that offer instant downloads for instant confirmations are also protected; Coindl does not need to change its business model. It is indeed possible to force a refund from such a business using this technique, but they are still protected from incurring any significant monetary loss from the act by economics. Digital goods like books, movies and songs have essentially zero marginal cost, meaning that, for example, Apple has to pay less than a penny in extra electricity and bandwidth costs when you download an album from them for $11.99. Using this technique to coax a digital download site into giving you a free song or book is thus essentially equivalent to downloading it through a torrent network; even if half the people in the world start doing it, the honest customers and artists can still continue to carry out their business in peace.As for solutions, the simplest, and guaranteed to be sufficient, patch is to simply wait for one confirmation before doing anything irreversible. Of course, there are some business models for which this is simply not acceptable; the whole attraction of SatoshiDice was instantly getting one’s money back if one wins. SatoshiDice themselves have already solved the problem; they now require all incoming bets to include transaction fees. Even if sites do not want to introduce such a complication, however, there are still other options. About eight months ago, a now-defunct company called RingCoin released a product named ZipConf, with the intent of supporting merchants accepting instant confirmations by making it more difficult for transactions that have not had a block confirmation to be reversed. Zipconf’s software stack attempts to prevent such attacks in two ways. First of all, it broadcasts the first transaction to as much of the network as possible as soon as its gets it, so that nodes will ignore any transaction that follows it seeing that it conflicts with an existing transaction. Second, Zipconf was willing to compromise slightly on being instant, waiting a few extra seconds after receiving a transaction to listen for fraud attempts before finally accepting it. By then, the transaction will have spread to much of the network and, the theory went, it would be nearly impossible for a second transaction to gain a foothold.Such an approach can be implemented by businesses like SatoshiDice, although it can be combined with other techniques. For example, SatoshiDice might consider immediately re-sending the output of any transaction that they receive to themselves with a fee, encouraging miners to quickly confirm both the new transaction and its parent over any conflicting transactions. Another layer of defense would be refusing and immediately returning overly large or non-standard transactions. A third strategy would be cooperating with the miners and the Bitcoin developers themselves, getting them to include a patch that does not accept conflicting transactions over older ones even if the new transaction is much smaller and has a higher fee. Individual “selfish” miners may take the fee, but the majority of mining is controlled by mining pools, which are large enough that the public good of the utility of the Bitcoin network itself outweighs any personal cost to them of not accepting such transactions. Thus, on the whole, although this is one of the larger speed bumps the Bitcoin protocol has had to deal with, especially as it is a zero-day vulnerability, it is still only a speed bump. The community will simply need to make an earnest effort to make sure that all businesses and miners are patched to address the issue, and even instant confirmations will still likely continue to exist.",

    "title": "This Friday, Bitcoin Central, a Bitcoin exchange based in France, announced what has already been hailed as a major step",
    "text": "This Friday, Bitcoin Central, a Bitcoin exchange based in France, announced what has already been hailed as a major step forward for Bitcoin: they are now licensed to perform many of the same functions as a bank. Soon, a Bitcoin Central account will have all of the core features of a standard bank account in Europe. Each account will have its own international bank account number (IBAN) with which anyone will be able to send money to that account via bank wire. On the withdrawal side, Bitcoin Central will soon issue debit cards similar to those now in the works by BitInstant that would automatically convert the holder’s BTC balance to euros on the fly. And, finally, the euro balance of a Bitcoin Central account will be federally insured up to $100,000 by the French “Garantie des depôts” (roughly equivalent to FDIC insurance in the United States). Furthermore, these features will not just be available to residents of France; anyone in the world will be able to open a verified account if they are willing to provide proper identification.If all goes according to plan, Bitcoin Central’s announcement will mean a lot for Bitcoin integration in the years to come. Acquiring bitcoins in the first place has always been the most difficult part of participating in the Bitcoin economy, and now, anyone with an account at Bitcoin Central will be able to, for example, have their salary paid into that account and automatically converted to Bitcoin. Bitcoin enthusiasts will be able to get pretty close to abandoning the traditional banking system entirely, storing their funds in BTC and using a Bitcoin-denominated debit card to pay for their purchases when they interact with businesses that do not use Bitcoin. As more people start accepting and spending Bitcoin, this opens up a path for the currency to gradually enter the mainstream world; if some businesses realize that some of their employees are converting their salaries to Bitcoin and some of their customers are paying them with Bitcoin debit cards, they may wish to cut out the middleman entirely and allow both sides to pay and receive bitcoins directly.Another important aspect to highlight is what this means for Bitcoin’s legitimacy. There have been a considerable number of legal concerns around Bitcoin in the past few months. In September, the now-defunct Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange’s James McCarthy, in an interview explaining why he shut his platform down, claimed that the regulatory standing of Bitcoin exchanges is much more treacherous than many assume, and that “all existing bitcoin exchanges that are not doing AML on all accounts (even bitcoin only accounts) are at risk” of being shut down. In October, the European Central Bank released a report entitled “Virtual Currency Schemes” which, although in many ways positive to Bitcoin, ended with the ominous words “Further action from other authorities can reasonably be expected in the near future.” Legal concerns have been cited by many as a major factor hindering Bitcoin adoption, and the fact that the banking system is now willing to deal with Bitcoin in this way will do much to alleviate other organizations’ fears.There has also unfortunately been a considerable amount of miscommunication both within the Bitcoin community and outside about this deal (in which I admit to participating myself), and Bitcoin Central has deemed it fit to release a public message clarifying the facts. The misconception started with the headline of the forum thread making the announcement, “Bitcoin-Central, first exchange licensed to operate as a bank. This is HUGE” This was widely misinterpreted to mean that Bitcoin Central will have the power to act as a bank themselves, but Bitcoin Central’s David François (also known in the Bitcoin community as Davout) clarified: We said “licensed to operate as a bank” which we mean as ��open accounts to third-parties and hold fiat currency on their behalf in compliance with the regulatory framework’. The headline has since been corrected to instead say “operate with a bank.”In fact, Bitcoin Central (or rather its parent company Paymium) has a deal with Aqoba, an institution which is already licensed to operate as a “payment services provider”, a status which David François describes as “exactly what a bank does, minus the issuing of credit”, and Bitcoin Central will be able to perform the same actions as a payment services provider by doing everything through Aqoba. Aqoba itself is partnered with Crédit Mutuel Arkea, an actual bank (or, more precisely, a banking and insurance cooperative), which is where the euro portion of Bitcoin Central account balances will be held. Thus, it is only the euro balances that are federally insured; BTC balances are protected only by good old-fashioned “cold-storage and extreme security paranoia.”Some are worried about the potential legal issues surrounding what Bitcoin Central is doing. A number of Bitcoin exchanges, including, Intersango in the UK,Bitcoin Mercado in Brazil, and even MtGox in France iself have had their banking partners abandon them, and some are worried that, despite the Paymium team’s careful legal research particularly around the MtGox case, the same will happen to Bitcoin Central as well. Mike Hearn raises the concern that Bitcoin Central may be forced to close its doors to US residents in the future due to US foreign tax regulations. Others have raised the opposite argument: that, like Tor, Bitcoin is a vital tool in maintaining one’s privacy against the state, and regulation will only be harmful to Bitcoin achieving what they consider to be its primary purpose.To those who are concerned about Bitcoin Central’s legal situation, François’s response so far can be summarized in one comment: “I hear you and that makes sense, I guess we’ll find out.” To those who see Bitcoin as a way of fighting against the traditional banking system and government regulation, François has one simple reply: “If you don’t see value here too bad, just don’t use us. We’re an option, not an obligation. We won’t force anyone.” All in all, Bitcoin Central’s new offering will only expand the range of choices that Bitcoin users have available to them.",

    "title": "Although the problem is now considerably smaller than it was one year ago, a significant amount of misinformation about Bitcoin",
    "text": "Although the problem is now considerably smaller than it was one year ago, a significant amount of misinformation about Bitcoin continues to float around the internet. Part of the problem is that the concept of Bitcoin is so unlike anything seen before; decentralized currencies that have no offline presence were not exactly a common sight before Bitcoin came along. Bitcoin is also unusual in that it is a high-tech subject which has consequences reaching far outside the technology world, leading to under-educated journalists churning out sentences like \"the Bitcoin program is under licensing by MIT, the globalist-controlled think-tank college\". In reality, the MIT license used by Bitcoin does nothing more than give anyone the right to freely use, modify and redistribute the software, and has as little to do with MIT itself as Arabic numerals do with Al Qaeda and the governments of Syria and Iran.Another issue is the natural desire to write an interesting story; a story about the average suit-and-tie businessman using Bitcoin to quickly and cheaply move money across international borders is far less likely to generate pageviews than an \"underground website where you can buy any drug imaginable\". Thus, a natural bias exists in favor of the latter over the former.Major news claims about Bitcoin spread like memes, only serving to compound the problem. For example, after the Financial Post claimed on June 8 that \"Europeans were moving their money out of their banks and dumping it into ... Bitcoin\", a flood of other similar articles followed. On June 11, Business Insider ran an article based almost entirely on the Financial Post article claiming the same thing, and Betabeat and variousblog sites followed. One of these sites in turn catapulted the story onto Slashdot, and ZDnet and Daily Finance ran their own articles on the subject soon after. In reality, however, the story of investors flocking from Euros to Bitcoin en masse turned out to have been grossly exaggerated - Amir Taaki reports that \"the only thing thatâ€™s happened is that the euro has increased in price vs the dollar slightly.\"Even in the case of stories that are essentially true, the effect can still manifest itself; when Bitcoin Central announced that it was partnering with a registered banking partner in France, the erroneous claim that Bitcoin Central was itself becoming a licensed payment services provider rather than simply partnering with an existing one was so mercilessly copied throughout the internet that Bitcoin Central was forced to release a statement clarifying the facts.The following are some clarifications on the major misconceptions that have surfaced regarding Bitcoin over the past one and a half years.Bitcoin does not have a central organization or authority. This feature of Bitcoin is among the least understood among people who are new to the currency, and perhaps the hardest to wrap one's head around. A recent article by Occupy Corporatism stumbled around this difficulty considerably, making claims like \"Bitcoin has been given that status of a 'payment service provider'\" and \"Bitcoin now has an International Bank ID number\". Although the Bitcoin community does include organizations with names like the Bitcoin Foundation and Bitcoin Central, none of these are anything close to central authorities for Bitcoin with inherent power over Bitcoin as a whole. Bitcoin Central is only one Bitcoin exchange among many - and not even the biggest one. The Bitcoin Foundation is simply an organization consisting of highly respected members in the Bitcoin community and developers of a particularly popular piece of Bitcoin client software. Anyone could potentially create their own exchange and their own foundation and displace either of these outright. Rather than thinking of Bitcoin as a product released by a traditional corporation, it is more appropriate to think of it as a self-sustaining digital commodity, similar to gold. It has a healthy satellite industry that provides products and services based around it, and it has its own business and advocacy organizations, but there is no central Gold Corporation. The databases that show Bitcoin addresses with a given bitcoin balance are all collectively managed by the network using a peer-to-peer network, similarly to the peer-to-peer networks used by file sharing services.The Bitcoin price did NOT fall to $0.01 in June 2011. The backstory behind this myth is an event in June where an administrator account at MtGox, a Bitcoin exchange which had over 80% market share at the time, was hacked, and the attacker managed to manipulate MtGox's database tables to create a balance of 2 million bitcoins within his account and immediately sold them, consuming all of the buy orders that had been placed on the site in the months before going from $17.50 all the way down to $0.01. However, what sank to $0.01 was not the actual Bitcoin price, but rather a MtGox representation of the price. A price is, by definition, a value in exchange for which something is being bought and sold at a given time. In this case, however, MtGox later rolled back all of the trades that had happened during the event, so no lasting purchase or sale was actually made at anything less than $10. MtGox's price charts show no transactions happening on the day. Aside from the attacker, no human being was, at any point, willing to sell bitcoins at anything close to $0.01 - the orders that were processed were all made weeks and months before the event, and at exchanges other than MtGox, the price generally remained at a healthy $13-$18. And, most importantly of all, the 2 million BTC that were sold were not even real bitcoins - they were simply fraudulent entries in MtGox's database. Although it is understandable how some can interpret the event as the price dropping to $0.01, pointing to this incident as a sign of Bitcoin's price instability is highly disingenuous - the root cause was a security mishap at a third party service, not a sudden loss of confidence in the currency. Incidentally, if the MtGox hack does count as the Bitcoin price dropping to $0.01, then another, less known, MtGox glitch deserves to count as the Bitcoin price reaching $1 billion.Bitcoin itself has never been significantly counterfeited or hacked. A number of articles over the past one and a half years have come out with headlines triumphantly proclaiming \"Bitcoin hacked\", or something similar in the introductory paragraph, and recently an article on the Washington Post claimed that in the future we would be smuggling \"counterfeit digital currencies.\" Unfortunately, Bitcoin's security reputation has been negatively affected as a result. In reality, however, stories about Bitcoin being hacked are simply instances of the central authority misconception manifesting itself once again. The Bitcoin protocol itself and the various services that have been built up by the Bitcoin economy are two completely different things; saying that the former was hacked when the real victim was one of the latter is like saying the US dollar was hacked when criminals manage to steal $10 million by breaking into point of sale terminals. Incidentally, the US dollar itself has been \"hacked\"; a large part of North Korea's revenue comes from counterfeiting hundred dollar bills; the Bitcoin protocol, on the other hand, has not had any significant security breaches. There have been a few minor incidents involving special methods of accepting Bitcoin that are known to be unsafe, but the scope of these attacks is well understood and very limited, and the average user and business is not vulnerable at all. Because all clients enforce the 21 million bitcoin supply limit, \"counterfeiting\" new bitcoins into existence is impossible outright. On the whole, the cryptographic and game-theoretical foundations behind the Bitcoin system have proven to be rock solid, and the fact that no one has yet claimed the $140 million reward for breaking these foundations is a testament to this. To the average user, there are only two ways to lose one's bitcoins to malicious activity: entrust the bitcoins a third party service that turns out to itself be insecure or fraudulent, or have your own computer get hacked by a computer virus - both of which are problems in the traditional financial system as well, costing the US economy $50 billion per year.Bitcoin is NOT (yet) seeing massive growth in usage to evade trade sanctions in Iran. Much like the Bitcoin Euro story, this is another meme that has spread around the internet all too quickly for its own good. After Business Week came out with its article on November 29, Reason, Infowars, various financialblogs and much later CNN all picked up on the story, often simply copying paragraphs while offering little or no original research of their own. In reality, the Iran story does have some grain of truth, as there have been signs of increasing activity from Iran in the past few months, but on the grand scale, Bitcoin is far from making significant inroads - on Google Trends, Bitcoin is not even on the charts for Iran. What happened here was a common journalistic fallacy: the media took a single story of an Iranian earning bitcoins by selling music on CoinDL and wrongly extrapolated to a story about Iranians switching to Bitcoin en masse. There is nothing wrong with writing an article expressing the potential for Bitcoin to be used to bypass trade sanctions on a larger scale, but one must be careful not to assert that such a thing is already happening.Bitcoin IS being used to sell illegal drugs on sites like Silk Road. However, illegal goods other than drugs - including assassinations, child pornography and even guns, are NOT gaining significant traction. The black market website Silk Road made considerable news a few months ago when a paper by Nicolas Cristin was released, claiming that the site had a monthly trade volume of over $2 million. Focusing on the black market aspect of Bitcoin is a popular habit of journalists, as shown by US senator Charles Schumer in June 2011 when he accused Bitcoin of being \"an online form of money laundering used to disguise the source of money\" when buying and selling drugs. Even now, articles are using Schumer's words as part of a two-sentence introduction to what Bitcoin is. Other articles, however, go even further; one blog piece claims that \"the fact that you can buy drugs, guns, and assassinations with Bitcoins is indisputable,\" and another video portrays bitcoins as the go-to currency for purchasing prostitution, guns, stolen art and more. These claims, however, are exaggerated. The video claims that \"at one point the Silk Road drew the line at selling products harmful to others like firearms, stolen credit card numbers and more, but as the site grew things turned for the worse,\" but this statement is factually wrong - in fact, as time went on, things turned for the better. Stolen credit card numbers, child pornography and assassinations were never allowed on Silk Road, and even the much more lax Black Market Reloaded has slowly begun clamping down on immoral activity - assassinations and child pornography can no longer be found on the site. After growing controversy among the site's users, Silk Road's mastermind Dread Pirate Roberts banned firearms from Silk Road in January 2012, moving firearms sales to a dedicated site. However, the site failed to gain traction, and Roberts closed the Armory down only six months later due to inactivity. Guns were not allowed back on Silk Road. The assassination threat is similarly overblown. If one casually scrolls through black market sites on the Tor network, there are indeed a number of sellers offering assassinations at a price anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000 USD, typically asking for Bitcoin as the payment method. However, a more detailed analysis shows a different picture. These sellers' accounts invariably have no reputation or feedback of any kind, and they never offer to use an escrow service. This can only point to one conclusion: they are all scams. It costs nothing to put such an advertisement online, and scammers can simply wait until a customer contacts them, and then extract as much upfront payment as they possibly can. Some of these scams may even be vigilantes and police, deliberately undermining any semblance of trust in markets for such services in an attempt to protect potential victims.It is easy to understand why so many writers have made these kinds of mistakes. It is easy to fall victim to the desire to come up with an interesting story that will generate pageviews, especially when there is often so little incentive to dig through to the more boring truth. To combat these myths, therefore, we must all be vigilant. Whether a given story is unfairly biased against Bitcoin, or even unfairly biased in its favor, it is important to work together to make sure that the truth always comes out - in the first case, not to needlessly scare potential Bitcoin adopters away, and in the second case, not to disappoint. Hopefully, as public understanding of what Bitcoin is continues to develop, we will be seeing far fewer outdated or inaccurate claims in 2013, and with luck, Bitcoin will be free to rise or fall - but hopefully rise - on its own merits.",

    "text": "Bitcoin continues to infiltrate and benefit numerous industries around the world. Just this past week, Vanity Cosmetic Surgery chose to accept payment for services in Bitcoin. After reading a news article on BTC China taking Bitcoin to 200USD per BTC, Vanity Cosmetic Surgery’s team decided to accept Bitcoin as a method of payment.Vanity Cosmetic Surgery issued the following press release:Miami, Florida (PRWEB) November 02, 2013Since Vanity began doing business, they have gone through extraordinary lengths to facilitate payment options for their international patients. Since they treat people from all over the world, they usually accepted most major currencies, but now with the implementation of Bitcoin they open the doors to new possibilities in cyberspace. By doing this, Vanity becomes the only medical center in the world to accept Bitcoins as an official payment method. Patients may request to pay with Bitpoints, when they call or visit any of their three centers in South Florida. These innovative services benefits anyone, especially foreigners who do not want to exchange their currency for US dollars, who already have a Bitcoin account.What does this mean to patients? They can now use their loaded Bitcoin account to pay for a breast augmentation or a nose job, or maybe a laser hair removal treatment. This will definitely transform the way people will choose their doctors in the near future.Initially any currency could be converted into this internet token, but now the other way around is possible, with the new ATM machines installed in some places across the globe. Bitcoins can usually be used to pay things with a cellphone or in certain online stores. As such, once Bitcoin’s concept becomes global, traveling around would not require monetary exchange, as more brick-and-mortar businesses start to welcome this new payment method. For users the Bitcoin website offers a lot of security measures for a minor price.About Bitcoin ExchangeBitcoin has become a universally accepted internet currency. It’s free to open an account. At Localbitcoins.com, Bitcoins can be used to buy and sell anything, as long as the information required is available. In most transactions, security fees may not be required.About Vanity Cosmetic Surgery:Vanity CS performs the most variety of plastic surgeries in all the South Coast. They have become famous for performing the most Trans-umbilical breast augmentation surgeries in the US, making them an authority when it comes to TUBA surgery. This versatility draws patients from all over the US and the world. Their large 5,000 square feet state-of-the-art facility makes them the biggest plastic surgery center in South Florida. They can be found in Miami, Hialeah and Plantation. They currently offer TUBA (Trans-umbilical breast augmentation), liposuction, butt-lift, breast reduction and many other kinds of cosmetic surgeries.Bitcoin Magazine had an opportunity to interview Carlos Yela of Vanity Cosmetic Surgery.Bitcoin Magazine (BM): When did you first hear about Bitcoin?Carlos Yela (CY): A couple of months ago I found several discussions online about Bitcoin being a new trend and how China was getting more involved in it.BM: What was it about Bitcoin that you found interesting?CY: I think that Bitcoin itself is revolutionary, It’s a total new way of creating wealth and trade, and its growing popularity rate is so extraordinary.BM: When did you first get the idea for your organization/site/services and what inspired you to create the site?CY: Vanity Cosmetic Surgery is a well established cosmetic surgery center that in only 5 years has become the largest center of its kind in the state.BM: Where do you see organization/site/services going in a year?CY: At this point we are expanding our presence in the web, this is a strategy to promote our services not only in our local market but nationally and internationally as well, this strategy will allow us to become the number 1 plastic surgery center to receive patients from other states.BM: What makes your product stand out in comparison to other products/businesses utilizing Bitcoin?CY: We are not only the largest and most comprehensive center in the state with the widest variety of procedures available, but we also have a medical team of 6 of the best plastic surgeons in the East Coast as well as the best facilities, we only use the latest equipment available for all our procedures and treatments and always in the cleanest and most sanitized environment.BM: What are your suggestions for individuals hoping to use Bitcoin in a business like yours?CY: Our suggestion for Bitcoin users is for them to make up their mind if they are thinking of getting some cosmetic procedure done, we are the best option for many reasons: price, service, quality, accessibility and most important we are located in the most touristic city of the United States; when people come to our center from other places, they don’t only receive our excellent service but they enjoy our beautiful weather and beaches here in South Florida.",

    "text": "Read the exclusive interview with Primecoin’s creator Sunny King in the issue 13 of Bitcoin Magazine.One of the disadvantages of Bitcoin that its proponents often gloss over is the fact that its mining algorithm has little real-world value. The underlying issue is this: in order to add a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain, a Bitcoin miner must include a “proof of work”, a number which has a property that is hard to find numbers that satisfy, but is efficient to verify. Essentially, a proof of work is a way of proving to the world that the miner spent a certain amount of computational effort generating the block, and is in fact a vital component of Bitcoin’s security – without proof of work, an attacker could easily pretend to be a million Bitcoin nodes at the same time, and in that way seriously compromise Bitcoin’s transaction ordering mechanisms. The canonical attack, the so-called “double spending” fraud, involves sending a payment to a merchant, later sending the same coins back to yourself and then creating a false consensus that the second transaction happened first, thereby depriving the merchant of their money. Proof of work solves the problem by making “pretending to be a million Bitcoin nodes” prohibitively expensive. However, what makes people uncomfortable is that in Bitcoin’s case the work (SHA256 computations) has no underlying value; rather, Bitcoin’s proof of work is literally nothing more than burning electricity for its own sake.It has always been thought that we could do better. Many newbies to Bitcoin immediately suggest that the mining algorithm should have involved SETI@home or folding@home, so that the computations would also help bring humanity closer to curing protein misfolding diseases or finding aliens. The problem is, however, that Bitcoin mining requires one key property that SHA256 does have but SETI@home and folding@home do not: it is efficiently verifiable. Right now, all participants in the SETI and folding networks are volunteers, meaning that they (probably) have no intentions other than the desire to actually help the project’s underlying goal. If these networks become tied to Bitcoin mining, however, participants will be motivated by profit, so there would be an overwhelming incentive for miners not to bother with the actual computations and instead provide fake data that has no value to the networks’ underlying goals but is indistinguishable from a genuine computational output.Primecoin is the first proof-of-work based cryptocurrency that has come up with any kind of workable solution. The central premise of Primecoin is that, instead of useless SHA256 hashes, the proof of work protocol would require miners to find long chains of prime numbers. There are three specific types of chains that are of interest: Cunningham chains of the first kind, Cunningham chains of the second kind, and “bi-twin” chains. The rule behind a Cunningham chain of the first kind is that each prime in the chain must be one less than twice the previous. The first Cunningham chain of length 5, for example, consists of the following six primes:1531, 3061, 6121, 12241, 24481In Cunningham chains of the second kind, each prime must be one more than twice the previous. Here, the first length-5 chain appears much sooner:2, 5, 11, 23, 47Finally, bi-twin chains are chains of pairs of twin primes, or primes that are 2 units apart from each other, with the average of each pair being twice the average of the previous pair. Each bi-twin chain must obviously have even length; the first chain six primes long is:211049, 211051, 422099, 422101, 844199, 844201Note that a bi-twin chain is essentially a Cunningham chain of the first kind and a Cunningham chain of the second kind rolled into one; the first numbers of each pair follow the recurrence that each one is one more than twice the previous (211049 * 2 + 1 = 422099, etc), and the second numbers of each pair are similarly one less than twice the previous.What is the practical utility of finding primes? Well, if the effort that we put into the topic today for its own sake is any indication, there is definitely at least something to it. The Electronic Frontier Foundation is offering $550,000 worth of prizes to the first groups to discover a prime number more than 1 million, 10 million, 100 million and 1 billion digits long. The first two awards have already been claimed. The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search has been looking for large prime numbers since 1996, and mathematicians in universities around the world are involved. The University of Tennessee at Martin provides a list of reasons why looking for primes is useful; aside from “for the glory!”, searching for primes leads to useful byproducts in other areas of number theory, provides an incentive for computational hardware development and leads to insights in the underlying workings of prime numbers themselves; the prime number theorem, for example, a theorem stating with high precision how often prime numbers are likely to occur at a given size, was first conjectured by looking at the distribution of actual prime numbers. Here, the hope is that if Primecoin takes off people will start looking for much more efficient ways of finding Cunningham and bi-twin chains, potentially leading to mathematical breakthroughs in how these chains work.Further RefinementsIn order to be a viable cryptocurrency, Primecoin needs a way to finely tune the difficulty of the proof of work; otherwise, new developments in technology or increased popularity may lead to new blocks being created too quickly for the blockchain to be stable or so slowly that transactions take hours to confirm. By themselves, prime chains do not provide enough granularity; a chain eight primes long may be a hundred times harder to find than a chain seven primes long. One option is to reward length, but that would make verification more difficult. The solution that Primecoin settled for is one based on the Fermat test. The Fermat test is a quick way of telling if a number is (very probably) a prime: raise any number (typically 2) to the power of a prime, subtract out the prime as many times as possible and see if you get the original number back. For example:217– 17 * 7710 = 2223– 23 * 364722 = 2But:221– 21 * 99864 = 8An alternative, and slightly better, formulation is to raise the number to the power of the prime minus one and see if you get one; this being true clearly implies the number passing the other test, and the other direction holds most of the time (one exception is that 3560= 375 but 3561= 3 (561 is not prime), but these become extremely rare as primes get bigger). Primecoin uses the p-1 test in combination with the Euler-Lagrange-Lifchitz test, which uses similar principles, to establish primality. So, the question is, how can one use this test to create granularity? That is, how can one distinguish between a chain 7.2 primes long and a chain 7.5 primes long? The answer is simple: look at the resulting value of the Fermat test of the first value in the chain not to be a prime; the lower it is, the larger the “fractional length”. For example, our chain of 2, 5, 11, 23, 47 has the next value 95, 294modulo 95 (modulo being the mathematical term for the process of repeated subtraction used above) is 54, so the chain would have a length of 5 + (95 – 54) / 95 ~= 5.43. However, the chain 1531…24481 has the next value 48961 with a relatively low Fermat remainder of 1024, so the length would be 5 + (48961 – 1024) / 48961 ~= 5.97. In order for a prime chain to count as a valid proof of work, it must have a fractional length at least equal to the difficulty; as of the time of this writing, this parameter is floating around 7.1.Since we do not want proofs of work to be reusable, Primecoin also adds another restriction. For the purposes of Primecoin, the “origin” of a bi-twin chain is defined as the average of the first pair, and for single Cunningham chains the origin is what the average of the first pair would be if the Cunningham chain’s twin also existed; for example, the origins of the two single Cunningham chains given above are 1530 and 3, respectively. The restriction is that the origin of a prime chain must be divisible by the hash of the block that the proof of work is for. Hash functions have the property that the only way to look for a value that has a particular hash is the computationally infeasible strategy of simply trying new values until you get a result that works; thus, the only way to generate valid proofs of work is to look for prime chains targeted to one block of which you already know the hash, and these chains would only ever be useful for that specific block.Primecoin also adds a number of other innovations on the side:Smooth difficulty adjustment – unlike Bitcoin, which adjusts its difficulty to exactly match the target rate of 1 block per 10 minutes every 2016 blocks (roughly two weeks), Primecoin adjusts its difficulty slightly every block, nudging it toward the target rate in an exponential decay pattern. For example, if network hash power (or rather, prime generation power) suddenly doubles, the next block would be 0.02 harder than the previous, increasing the amount of work required per block to 186.5 of the original after one week and 198.2 after two weeks, assuming no further mining power increases take place.Very fast confirmations – unlike Bitcoin, where transactions take an average of ten minutes to confirm (eight minutes in practice since the difficulty must constantly catch up to increasing mining power), Primecoin blocks come at a rate of one per minute. This allows secure transactions to be made much more quickly; six confirmations may take fifty minutes in Bitcoin, but they take only six minutes in Primecoin. The underlying mathematics behind why six confirmations is a fairly safe threshold is independent of block confirmation time, so the Primecoin transaction at six confitmations is no less secure (it can be argued that attackers can make double-spending attempts ten times more frequently, but going up to just seven or eight confirmations more than makes up for this).Self-adjusting block reward – Bitcoin is known for its controlled currency supply algorithm, which guarantees that only 21 million bitcoins will ever be generated, as well as specifying the rate at which these bitcoins will come out. Primecoin follows a different path. The number of primecoins (XPM) released per block is always equal to 999 divided by the square of the difficulty, a formula which should converge to some maximum if the difficulty increases linearly. Given that Moore’s Law states that computing power increases exponentially, and the effort it takes to find a prime chain is exponential in its length, that is quite likely to hold true.There are some places where Primecoin missed some serious opportunities for improvement. First of all, the self-adjusting block reward was intended to be a “more natural simulation of gold’s scarcity”. However, in practice it does the exact opposite. The desirable property that gold has is that its supply at least somewhat increases with its value; if the gold price shoots past $5,000, mining opportunities will become profitable that were not profitable before, increasing the rate at which new gold is mined and eventually making the supply go up, partially counteracting the price shock. Here, if the price goes up by a factor of ten, the difficulty will shoot up significantly as well as more miners move in, leading to… a reduction in the Primecoin generation rate. Thus, instead of adding the negative feedback mechanism inherent in gold, Primecoin instead creates a positive feedback mechanism that exacerbates the problem of volatility. Also, Primecoin could have set up its exponential adjustment algorithm to have a much longer period – reaching 86.5 adjustment after two months, for example, instead of a week. This is one innovation that would also at least somewhat stabilize the value of the currency by generating more coins when interest goes up, but unfortunately so far no currency has tried this; Primecoin, despite all of its other improvements, missed the chance to be the first.All in all, Primecoin presents itself as an extremely interesting experiment; for the first time, we have a currency whose mining algorithm has a secondary value, and at the same time Primecoin, unlike so many other coins before it, actually makes serious attempts to improve on Bitcoin in unrelated aspects. Not taking into account Bitcoin’s massive headstart, Primecoin may well be the first alternative coin to actually be better than Bitcoin, giving the currency the potential for a bright future ahead.Read the exclusive interview with Primecoin’s creator Sunny King in the issue 13 of Bitcoin Magazine.",

    "text": "The most famous torrent site in the world, The Pirate Bay, has just started accepting Bitcoin donations, placing a donation address on their front page. The initiative quickly proved to be very successful, raising over 10 BTC ($1,300) in little more than a single day, and other major torrent sites have quickly started to do the same thing. EZTV, OpenBitTorrent, PublicBitTorrent and istole.it have all added Bitcoin donation addresses onto their front pages.In terms of promoting awareness, this is a fairly large step forward for Bitcoin. The Pirate Bay is ranked by Alexa as the 77th most visited site on the internet, placing it above all other Bitcoin-accepting sites to date except WordPress at 21st. However, the Pirate Bay’s use of Bitcoin, and that of the other torrent sites that have rapidly followed suit, is much more prominent. Unlike WordPress, Namecheap and Reddit, which do not make any attempt to advertise their acceptance of Bitcoin beyond an initial press release, the Bitcoin address on The Pirate Bay in particular is immediately visible to everyone who accesses the page. The message that The Pirate Bay is sending is clear: you do not need to be ashamed about supporting Bitcoin. Sure, Bitcoin is controversial, with some mainstream economists coming out outright against it, but what revolution isn’t? As an organization whose very continued existence has come to symbolize an ongoing victory against the pro-copyright establishment, The Pirate Bay understands this better than almost anyone else – except perhaps Wikileaks, although incidentally Wikileaks accepts Bitcoin too, and are actually doing quite well with it.Of course, businesses like WordPress, Reddit and NameCheap are not charities, and essentially since have already made the bold step of accepting Bitcoin in the first place we should not demand them to more actively promote Bitcoin from the kindness of their hearts if they do not want to. Fortunately, however, at least in spirit The Pirate Bay is a charity, and as members of the Bitcoin community, we should be very grateful that such organizations exist. It is only through people and organizations continually and passively promoting Bitcoin in this way that the currency will reach any kind of significant cultural acceptance – simple news articles primarily lead to transitory interest that, in the case of the latest bubble, has already largely faded away. News promotes Bitcoin as something special; passive promotion promotes Bitcoin as something normal. The answer to which one evokes less hostile attention from regulators, more interest from casual users, and ultimately more willingness on the part of more traditional businesses to accept Bitcoin and show it, is clear.When donating bitcoins in general, there is one security reminder that is important to repeat: don’t copy a donation address from anything other than the official website, and do not post a donation address without directly linking to the page that confirms the address as being legitimate. Posting fraudulent donation addresses is very easy, and it would be a shame if the Bitcoin community’s charitable nature were to be exploited by the most trivial of scams. Stay secure, stay safe, and feel free to donate a few bitcents today.",

    "text": "If you have been following the last year of progress in Bitcoin wallet development, you will have likely already heard of one of the latest trends in backend design: deterministic wallets. Unlike old-style Bitcoin wallets, which generate new Bitcoin addresses and private keys randomly as needed, in a deterministic wallet all of the data is generated using a specific algorithm from a single seed. That is to say, if you write down the seed to your deterministic wallet, and then after six months your hard drive gets corrupted and the wallet unrecoverable, you can simply create a new wallet using the same seed and all of the addresses and private keys from your old wallet will come back again exactly as they were before. This trend in wallet development has received near-universal praise, and nearly every Bitcoin client that intends to handle multiple addresses either already has a deterministic wallet implemented or is planning to create one.However, deterministic wallets in Bitcoin do not stop there. In fact, the latest deterministic wallets go beyond the simple design described above and have two key properties that are heavily advertised by their developers. The first of these properties is the concept of a “master public key“. A master public key is a key that can be generated from the wallet’s master private key (either the same thing as the “seed” or a derivative of it) that has the power to generate all of the addresses in a Bitcoin wallet, but none of the private keys. Thus, someone with access to a master public key can look at the balance of a deterministic wallet, but cannot actually spend the balance because they have no way of generating the private key corresponding to each address. The second property is hierarchy: the private keys that you generate from a master private key are themselves master private keys and can in turn be treated as deterministic wallets in their own right.How do Deterministic Wallets Work?As it turns out, there are two major types of deterministic wallets currently in use: Electrum wallets and BIP32 wallets; they use a very similar algorithm, allowing them both to have the master public key property, although the BIP32 wallets go further by also including the hierarchy property – Electrum wallets are designed to only go down one level, although one certainly could extend the Electrum protocol to make it hierarchical as well.The master public key property is perhaps the more surprising feature of deterministic wallets, and will be explored in detail first. The reason why it works is that Bitcoin public keys – not quite the same thing as Bitcoin addresses but a closely related form – can be added and subtracted just like normal integers can (although, notably, you cannot multiply two public keys together), and thus the same arithmetic operations can be done on two “levels” – to generate private keys, the arithmetic is done on the level of integers, and to generate public keys it is done on the level of public keys.The precise algorithm used by all deterministic wallet systems is this. To calculate the private key at index i (say i = 5), calculate an “offset” parameter using a function (technically, a hash) of the index and the master public key. Then, simply add the master private key and the offset together. To calculate the public key at index i, calculate the offset in the same way, convert the offset to a public key, and add the master public key and the offset public key together.Here are a few examples using Electrum wallets, done with my own pybitcointools library. First, we generate a master private key and master public key from the seed:> seed = random_electrum_seed()'afc3eef71d96c468ca52b437c385a621'> mprivkey = electrum_stretch(seed)'5df10c922a1c7888b5c3a5a7106e72576f09c17f0993f4f2ce0ef5ccdb2f53c5'> mpubkey = '04'+electrum_mpk(mprivkey)'04fd6d91db1bdfc231116fd7d44c61a02e032b38b90aad419ecf75acf501eebdc7a0b7818e16a97a6c87693c723106e6fe17d4da743fae991139b05e6d1fe5c8a8'Now, we generate private key index zero:> offset = dbl_sha256('0:0:'+mpubkey[2:].decode('hex'))'429251ad9607fd39040072d23f53d54fc3b1ea526310fa45ca2a2df0629e2db2'> priv0 = add_privkeys(mprivkey,offset)'a0835e3fc02475c1b9c418794fc247a732bbabd16ca4ef38983923bd3dcd8177'Now, the public key:> pub0 = add_pubkeys(mpubkey,privkey_to_pubkey(offset))'04d96f3a8ebb0de48a98a5d77003c1d3ed5a36aae3eb20ee138a233e0c644becf77263c6e56cca6cfe064eb87582dcf92e9066d567ae0ffa67b0a5a4fda2bd7d68'> addr = pubkey_to_address(pub0)'14EkQ9qsKxWKiBJm5f7mT7ozSKKZbQoZGS'And, just to show you that the math checks out:> privkey_to_pubkey(priv0)'04d96f3a8ebb0de48a98a5d77003c1d3ed5a36aae3eb20ee138a233e0c644becf77263c6e56cca6cfe064eb87582dcf92e9066d567ae0ffa67b0a5a4fda2bd7d68'We can repeat this with index 1, index 2, etc; you can try it yourself with your own Electrum wallet if you have one. The takeaway is this: you can safely give put your master public key in an insecure place, or even give it out to third parties like auditors, if it makes life more convenient for you; just keep the master private key (and the seed) to yourself.HierarchyNow, on to the hierarchical wallet property. This one is, once again, best described by simply showing it in action:> w = bip32_master_key('qweqweqweqweqwe')'xprv9s21ZrQH143K2KhRQVuMqhz798mvW89J1aJMWEKNfZzv3BPAgBc4TH59K8ZcLt8RrNJvbUzA72A92Grm3MorG2FnFaoZ7B8SDTYXgUBALoi'> w0 = bip32_ckd(w,0)'xprv9uyTuGongdyZAMxZ2euUBbpsAdtE2nxFBmcQn89UT4ZyzrMg5TXD7azCnsnpH9Q7yrYgG7nVakE6BTxJUarLrDA28VxS3ZWDsgYWZUxtNiH'> w000 = bip32_ckd(bip32_ckd(bip32_ckd(w,0),0),0)'xprv9zL8JVf2Us8VKFYoi3A8F3LSFuHnxNhAdVyrWuECgcbW13WcSrAZt9QxbbMvrFZsvUtrktVpNJ5iN1JhgUYDZoeXC5qtGfLuLw3reVWSRir'The main use case for which this feature is advertised is in hierarchical organizations: the treasurer of a company might have control over the root private key of a BIP0032 wallet, and then hand off a “child” seed to each of the company’s departments who will then use that seed to operate their own wallet. The treasurer will have the master key to everything, but each department will only have the key to their own part of the funds.And, of course, BIP32 has that same master public key property as Electrum, but even stronger:> wp = bip32_privtopub(w)'xpub661MyMwAqRbcEomtWXSNCqvqhAcQuas9NoDxJcizDuXtuyiKDivK15PdAPVkPwVXT9rFbjAnE9P3sLh6xnDawXF1uUXrruH1UvALHF89qdP'> wp000 = bip32_ckd(bip32_ckd(bip32_ckd(wp,0),0),0)'xpub6DKUi1BvKEgnXjdGp4h8cBHAow8HMqR1ziuTKHdpEx8UsqqkzPUpRwjSStDzFc5ALo93wyYXmRr9rvXWcrfw5MPFKCET11KFg3kNrESyWZ6'> wp000_2 = bip32_privtopub(w000)'xpub6DKUi1BvKEgnXjdGp4h8cBHAow8HMqR1ziuTKHdpEx8UsqqkzPUpRwjSStDzFc5ALo93wyYXmRr9rvXWcrfw5MPFKCET11KFg3kNrESyWZ6'Thus, a BIP32 master private key can be thought of being at the top of an infinitely descending tree, capable of recovering every private key below it. And a BIP32 master public key is just the same, except it can only recover public keys and addresses. Another metaphorical way to think about it is in terms of the private keys sitting at the canopy level of a rainforest, and the public keys on the ground below them. You can navigate the same path on the private key and public key level, and no matter where you jump down your destination will be the same, but once you’re on the ground you can’t get back up (tree-climbing monkeys that can go up from the public key ground level to the private key canopy are, at least for now, purely theoretical).An Understated ProblemFrom the descriptions we saw above, you likely understand that deterministic wallets have two properties. First, you can go from a parent key to a child key, but not in reverse. Second, you can give out your master public key with no risk to your funds – only your privacy. And this is how nearly all people, at least those technically skilled enough to know what a deterministic wallet is, view BIP0032 wallets today. The model of a company, which hands out child private keys to departments and master public keys to accountants and auditors, has come to take a central place in the mythology around the promise that BIP0032 wallets potentially hold. However, as we will see below, this description of hierarchical wallets is fatally flawed.The problem is this: although you certainly can securely hand out child keys with no risk to the parent key, and you can hand out master public keys with no risk to the master private key, you cannot do both at the same time. The exploit for when that situation does arise is actually quite simple, and can be done with two lines of pybitcointools code. I will use Electrum in this example, since Electrum wallets are more transparent. These are the same master public key and child private key I created above:> mpubkey'04fd6d91db1bdfc231116fd7d44c61a02e032b38b90aad419ecf75acf501eebdc7a0b7818e16a97a6c87693c723106e6fe17d4da743fae991139b05e6d1fe5c8a8'> priv0'a0835e3fc02475c1b9c418794fc247a732bbabd16ca4ef38983923bd3dcd8177'As we saw above, the first private key is calculated by a formula which can be summarized as mprivkey + calc_offset(mpubkey,index). So, what do we do? If you look for it closely, the answer is surprisingly obvious:> offset = dbl_sha256('0:0:'+mpubkey[2:].decode('hex'))'429251ad9607fd39040072d23f53d54fc3b1ea526310fa45ca2a2df0629e2db2'> mprivkey_2 = subtract_privkeys(priv0,offset)'5df10c922a1c7888b5c3a5a7106e72576f09c17f0993f4f2ce0ef5ccdb2f53c5'And tada, we get the master private key back. Now, we can go ahead and pilfer all of the other addresses in the wallet, even those which the wallet’s owner never intended to touch. I even included a command in pybitcointools to make this more convenient for you:> crack_electrum_wallet(mpubkey,priv0,0)'5df10c922a1c7888b5c3a5a7106e72576f09c17f0993f4f2ce0ef5ccdb2f53c5'BIP32 has the same vulnerability:> wp = bip32_privtopub(w)> w0 = bip32_ckd(w,0)> crack_bip32_privkey(wp,w0)'xprv9s21ZrQH143K2KhRQVuMqhz798mvW89J1aJMWEKNfZzv3BPAgBc4TH59K8ZcLt8RrNJvbUzA72A92Grm3MorG2FnFaoZ7B8SDTYXgUBALoi'In the interests of fairness, it is important to note that this is not a sudden new zero-day vulnerability discovery; many Bitcoin developers have known about this for a while. However, given the intuitive understanding of hierarchical deterministic wallets that many people implicitly promote, including the idea of handing out child private keys to organization departments and master public keys to auditors, this has a great potential to result in a security breach. It may only be a matter of time until a large organization decides to actually adopt a hierarchical deterministic wallet to protect its Bitcoin funds, and suddenly finds a collusion of one of its department heads and an auditor running off with the entire company funds. So the obvious question is: can this be fixed? The answer seems to be no; because the only operations that can be done with public keys is adding and subtracting them, the only way to implement a deterministic wallet with the master public key property is using the “offset” mechanism described here. If this is indeed true, then raising awareness is the only solution, together with a change in BIP32 representation and in clients to make it clear that master public keys and hierarchical wallets do not mix.There is one clever way in which this might be bypassed: making three hierarchical BIP32 wallets, with every address being a 2-of-3 multisignature address between the three wallets down some particular child key derivation path. Then, an auditor can have one of the three master public keys, and search the blockchain for transactions whose script contains public keys generated from that master public key. The solution is complex, not supported by any existing client, and far from perfect, but something like it seems to be the only way to get around the issue. In most cases, however, simply not handing out the master public key may be the better approach.So what is the future of deterministic wallets? At this point, BIP0032 is arguably as far as we can go; there are no known tricks in elliptic curve math that haven’t been exploited yet. One obvious upgrade might be BIP0032 multisignature wallets, combining BIP0032’s hierarchical deterministic magic with an advanced feature in Bitcoin that allows you to send bitcoins to an address that requires two out of three given private keys to spend the funds. Another further direction is brainwallets. The two current competitors for memorizing a Bitcoin wallet are (1) choosing a password and using the password or a hash of the password as a seed, and (2) randomly generating a seed and converting the seed into a passphrase in a way that can be reversed. The way that both approaches are implemented is currently somewhat flawed – the standard implementation of the first approach does far too little against brute force attacks, whereas the standard (Electrum) implementation of the second approach is too difficult to memorize – studies show that passphrases like “glow date cost bloody curve wheel cousin picture ring finally bubble press” are no easier to memorize than random strings of characters of an equal security level, and they offer no protection against forgetting one or two words. These are open problems – if you are a Bitcoin developer, you personally have the opportunity to come up with and standardize a solution.",

    "text": "In the past year or so, it has come to be a known fact in Bitcoin technical circles that Bitcoin, in its current form, is partially quantum-safe. The claim is that used Bitcoin addresses - that is, addresses which have both received and sent bitcoins, have their corresponding public key exposed on the blockchain, allowing quantum-enabled adversaries to break Bitcoin's elliptic curve cryptography, whereas unused Bitcoin addresses, which may have received bitcoins but have never been spent from, do not have their public keys exposed, allowing them to benefit from the much stronger cryptographic guarantees of SHA256 and RIPEMD-160. As long as the first transaction spending from any Bitcoin address empties out all of the funds stored in that address to new addresses as change, the theory goes, Bitcoin should remain just as secure as before. In fact, since most wallets already try not to reuse addresses to increase privacy, for most users only minor software changes would be needed to satisfy the more stringent security condition, so adapting to quantum computing would be a breeze. This argument has been made by many people in the Bitcoin community, notably including myself. In reality, however, the argument has a fatal flaw.Hashes and CurvesFirst, the technical background. In a Bitcoin user's wallet, each of that user's own Bitcoin addresses is represented by three distinct numbers: a private key, a public key and the address itself. The public key is derived from the private key by elliptic curve multiplication, and, given only classical computers like those that exist today, recovering the private key from a public key is essentially impossible. The address is derived from the public key by a series of three steps: applying the SHA256 hash function to the public key, applying the RIPEMD-160 hash function to that and finally adding a value called a checksum for error correction purposes (so that if you accidentally mistype a single character when sending to a Bitcoin address your money does not disappear into a black hole). The point of hash functions is that, just like elliptic curve multiplication, they are computationally infeasible to reverse; given an address, there is no way, aside from the brute force approach of trying all possible public keys, to find the public key that the address is derived from.Quantum computers have two major tools that make them superior to classical computers in breaking cryptography: Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm. Shor's algorithm is mainly useful for factoring numbers - for example, given the number 1728499, figuring out that the number is composed of the factors 1129 * 1531. With seven-digit numbers, the problem can even be solved on paper with enough patience, but if the numbers are hundreds of digits long quantum computers are required. In fact, the difficulty of factoring very long numbers is the basis of RSA, the oldest public key encryption algorithm and one still in use today. Grover's algorithm is far more generic - given a list of numbers and a mathematical property, it can figure out which one of those numbers satisfies the property. A modified version of Shor's algorithm can crack elliptic curve cryptography as well, and Grover's algorithm attacks basically anything, including SHA256 and RIPEMD-160.However, the two algorithms differ drastically in just how efficient they are. Shor's algorithm reduces the runtime of cracking elliptic curve cryptography from O(2k/2) to O(k3) - that is to say, since Bitcoin private keys are 256 bits long, the number of computational steps needed to crack them goes down from 340 trillion trillion trillion to a few hundred million at most. Grover's algorithm, on the other hand, does not offer anything close to so drastic a speedup. Rather, it simply provides a modest reduction from O(2k) to O(2k/2). In the case of RIPEMD-160, the weaker of the two hashes used to create a Bitcoin address, this means that the number of steps needed to recover a public key from an address goes down from 1.4 trillion trillion trillion trillion to 1.2 trillion trillion. Somewhat easier, but still thankfully impractical. As described above, used Bitcoin addresses from have an exposed public key, so it is the easy challenge of cracking elliptic curve cryptography with Shor's algorithm that is the bottleneck. Unused Bitcoin addresses, on the other hand, expose only the address itself, so it is the RIPEMD-160 Grover problem that poses the weakened, but still insurmountable, challenge.So What's the Problem?Here is where the above logic goes wrong. Everything about quantum computers in the above two paragraphs is, given public knowledge, is essentially correct, and if a Bitcoin address is truly unused, then indeed, even given quantum computers, any bitcoins lying inside are fine. However, the challenge is, how do you actually spend the funds? In order to release the bitcoins sent to that address, it is necessary to create a Bitcoin transaction, and that transaction must include a signature and a public key to verify that it was the owner of the private key that signed it. However, here lies the problem. By making that transaction, you have just released all of the information that anyone with a quantum computer needs to fully impersonate you, right on the spot. Without quantum computing, this is impossible, as Bitcoin's elliptic curve signatures only have enough information to recover the public key, not the private key. With quantum computing, elliptic curve signatures are as flimsy as a digital sheet of paper.If you send a transaction spending all 100 BTC in address 13ign, with 10 BTC going to 1v1tal to pay for goods and 90 BTC change going back to your new address at 1mcqmmnx, the first node that you send the transaction to can replace the change address with whatever they want, recover the private key from your public key, and forge your signature. The only way to get around the problem is essentially to send the transaction directly to a mining pool, like BTCGuild or Slush, and hope that the mining pool will be honest and place the transaction directly into the blockchain. Even then, however, you are vulnerable to a Finney attack - a dishonest miner can forge your signature, create a valid block containing his forged transaction continuing the blockchain from one before the most recent block (the one containing your transaction), and, since the lengths of the old and new blockchains would then be equal, the attacker would have a 50 chance of his block taking precedence. Thus, safe transactions are essentially impossible.Lamport Signatures: A SolutionBasically, the purpose of hash functions is to provide us with the mathematical equivalent of a lock. Publishing the hash of a value is similar to putting out a lock in public, and releasing the original value is like opening the lock. However, once the lock is open, it cannot be closed again. The problem is, however, that locks by themselves cannot make a secure digital signature scheme. What elliptic curve cryptography provides, and SHA256 and RIPEMD-160 do not, is a way of proving that you have the secret value behind a mathematical lock, and attaching this proof to a specific message, without revealing the original value or even making the proof valid for any other message than the one you attached. In Bitcoin, the message in question is a transaction. When your Bitcoin client sends a transaction to the network, what it is really doing is sending a mathematical proof of the following fact: this transaction, which states that I am sending this amount of money to this address, was constructed by someone in possession of the private key behind the Bitcoin address I'm sending from. This is the basis for the transactional side of Bitcoin's security.However, there is a construction that enables us to solve this problem without RSA, elliptic curves or any other traditional public-key cryptographic system: Lamport signatures. A Lamport signature is a one-time signature that gets around the lockbox problem in the following way: there are multiple locks, and it is the content of the message (or rather, the hash of the message) that determines which locks need to be opened. If someone tries to forge your message, it is almost certain (read: the sun will run out of hydrogen before the other scenario happens) that the Lamport signature scheme will require them to open at least one lock that you did not open already - which they, lacking the unreleased secret values, will not be able to do.How Lamport Signatures Work, In DetailLamport signatures may seem technically complex, but because they only have one ingredient - the hash function (in this case, we'll use RIPEMD-160) they are actually one of the most accessible cryptographic protocols for the average person to understand. The algorithm works as follows:Generate 160 pairs of 160-bit random numbers (you can make them all from a single seed with RIPEMD-160: RIPEMD-160(seed+1), RIPEMD-160(seed+2), etc). These values, or in some implementation the seed used to generate them, are your private key.Hash all of the random numbers (eg. with RIPEMD-160), and publish all 160 pairs of hashes. These are your public key, and will be needed by the network to later verify your signature.To sign a message, calculate the RIPEMD-160 hash of the message, and then depending on each bit of the hash release the secret number behind the first or second hash in each pair. If the bit is zero, open the first hash, and if the bit is one open the second hash.Under this scheme, a Bitcoin address will still be the SHA256+RIPEMD-160 hash of the public key; the only difference is that the public key will consist of 320 hashes rather than an elliptic curve point. A transaction will include the public key and the signature, just like today, and, once again just like today, verifiers will check that the public key matches the address and the signature matches the message and the public key. The signatures are unforgeable; even with Grover's algorithm, it will take 280steps for an adversary to construct a fraudulent transaction that requires them to reveal the exact same 160 secret numbers that you already revealed, or an adversary can take 280* 80 steps to simply crack all the hashes. Both numbers are in the trillions of trillions of computations.The only change in behavior that will be needed is for people to start using addresses only once; after two uses, the security of the Lamport scheme drops to 240, a value which might still be safe against quantum computers at first, but only barely, and after three uses it's as weak as elliptic curve cryptography. Theoretically, however, even this can be partially overcome; the Merkle signature scheme builds off of Lamport's idea to create signatures which can be used tens or hundreds, or potentially even thousands, of times before the private key needs to be retired. The only limit to the maximum number of transactions per address is basically a question of limiting blockchain bloat.Given what is currently public knowledge, quantum computers are still far away; the most powerful quantum computer to date managed to use Shor's algorithm to factor the number 21. However, sudden advances are always possible, and we always need to have a plan of what we can do if Edward Snowden decides to leak out that the NSA has fully functional quantum computers hiding in a secret data center. We probably cannot handle such a sudden event, but we certainly can handle cases where we get even a month of advance warning. The solution is this: as soon as a quantum pre-emergency is declared, everyone should move their wealth into a 1-of-2 multisignature transaction between an unused, old-style, Bitcoin address, and an address generated with the new Lamport scheme. Then, developers should quickly create the Lamport patch for as many Bitcoin clients as possible and push for everyone to upgrade. If the whole process is done within weeks, then by the time quantum computers become a threat the bulk of people's bitcoins will be in new-style Lamport addresses and will be safe. For those who still have their wealth in old-style addresses by then (unused old-style addresses that is; by that point coins in used old-style addresses could trivially be stolen), a few established organizations will agree to serve as trusted nodes, using the Merkle signature scheme to add an additional signature to transactions sending from old-style addresses to new-style addresses. To prevent network fraud and Finney attacks, the new Bitcoin rules would require all transactions from old to new after a certain point to be signed by these authorities. The authority system will introduce centralization, but it will only be a temporary emergency measure, and after a few years the system can be retired entirely. From there, we lick our wounds, pick up our losses and move on to enjoy some of the more wonderful things that quantum computing has to offer.",

    "text": "Bitcoin exchange rate volatility affects everybody who uses Bitcoin as a currency or trades it as an asset. However, the available material about Bitcoin volatility is limited. Therefore it's time for some investigation. The results are somewhat counter-intuitive. That makes the whole topic even more worthwhile.1. What is Bitcoin volatilityFor any traded currency or asset, volatility is a measure for the dispersion of value changes around the average change. Changes in value are usually looked at on a day to day basis. Value changes are measured as relative or percentage changes. That's because only relative changes are comparable between different assets and over time. To give an example: if the Bitcoin price goes from USD 100 to USD 101 per Bitcoin from one day to the other, that would be a +1 change. If the price went from USD 1,000 to USD 1,001 the absolute change is the same, but the relative change is only +0.1. Looking at a time series of daily changes, we can calculate the average daily percentage change over this period. The average daily change of BTC vs USD on Mt.Gox between July 2010 and August 2013 was 0.7. This figure is also called the mean or expected daily return on an asset. 0.7 average daily return is quite a lot compared to other assets.Once we have the average daily change over a given period, we can calculate volatility. We do this to get a figure for the average dispersion around the mean. The higher this dispersion (i.e. the volatility), the more uncertainty is attached to the expected return of this asset. Bitcoins had a daily volatility of 7.2 over the mentioned period. We annualize this figure to get an idea of the possible dispersion over one year. The result is 136 annualized return volatility, which also is a lot.So the Bitcoin volatility tells us how much the BTC vs USD exchange rate disperses around the mean over a given period. Let's look at some more historical data to put the Bitcoin volatility into perspective.2. Historical Bitcoin volatilityThinking of historical Bitcoin volatility, it's no big news that it was going through the roof. However, what does deserve attention is how it evolved. Since volatility is calculated as an arithmetic average, single observations have a high influence on the outcome. Therefore we need to put special emphasis on the most extreme moves. Had I asked \"when did the most extreme Bitcoin price changes happen?\", what would you have answered? My personal guess would have been: spring 2013. Absolute changes in that time were massive. But looking at relative figures tells us, that's not the whole story.Data sources: bitcoincharts.com; own calculationsThe chart shows us that the most dramatic Bitcoin price moves happened in 2011. In fact, 7 out of the 10 largest up moves occured in 2011, only one of them was in 2013. As we can see on the chart, it wasn't the biggest one. Regarding downside moves the situation is similar. 6 out of the 10 largest downside moves happened in 2011. Only 2 of them occured in 2013. This does not say the ups and downs of spring 2013 were small, it just means that the basis for volatility, daily returns, were even more extreme in 2011.When we talk about figures, they have more meaning if we relate them to other comparables. Only then it is possible to say whether something actually is \"big, \"small\", \"extreme\" etc. Therefore we need to take a step out of the Bitcoin ivory tower and have a look at the world outside of it. And we have to make sure we are comparing apples with apples.Before we can compare Bitcoin to something else, we need to know what it is. From a volatility perspective, Bitcoin can be two things. First, Bitcoin is a currency and a form of money. Bitcoin satisfies the three criteria that are generally taken to define money. These are: a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account. So when we think of Bitcoin as a currency, we need to compare it to other currencies.The second way of looking at Bitcoin is to regard it as an asset. Assets represent value. As long as someone is willing to pay something in exchange for Bitcoin (be it other currencies, commodities, services etc.), Bitcoins are assets. Whether they are backed by anything or not, whether they have inherent utility (whatever that is) or not, doesn't matter. Thus we can also compare Bitcoin to other assets. One obvious thing to do is to compare Bitcoins to other financial assets which are traded on liquid markets. Here prices adjust instantly to supply and demand and price data is publicly available.Data sources: bitcoincharts.com; Yahoo! Finance; quandl.com; own calculationsThe above chart shows the annualized 30 day moving average volatility of Bitcoin vs the US Dollar as traded on Mt.Gox. It is compared with the currency pair EURUSD and the S&P500 stock market index. There are two key messages following from this chart.Comparing Bitcoin volatility with EURUSD we can see, that the EURUSD pair has a much smaller volatility. Only very rarely it crosses the 10 line. On the other hand, the S&P500 volatility is higher and fluctuates more. In 2011 it crosses the 40 line. Back in 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, S&P500 volatility even went beyond 80 on an annualized basis. The Bitcoin volatility graph looks more like the S&P500 graph than like the EURUSD graph. Therefore, in the last three years Bitcoin prices behaved more like an asset than like a currency. The other thing this chart shows us, is that the Bitcoin volatility has significant second order effects. At many points the volatility jumps from moderate values to values beyond 30. So the change rate of volatility is high. This makes Bitcoin prices even more unpredictable. But looking at the development we also see, that these jumps tend occur less often. And more importantly, the Bitcoin volatility is declining. Slowly but steadily. Despite all the attention and the buzz, when it comes to Bitcoin volatility, the year 2013 so far has not been anything like 2011.3. Friend or foe?Now that we have looked at some facts, the question is how we judge them. Is high volatility helpful for Bitcoin or not. This depends on the perspective, from which you look at it. Volatility is also a synonym for risk. And risk usually has a connection to return. There is upside and downside potential. Some might like this, some might not.InvestorsPeople who invest in assets and derivatives on these assets calculate the risks of their investments. With high volatility, there is also a potential for big returns. Bitcoin has so far delivered outstanding returns. So for those investors who are risk-prone, high Bitcoin volatility is a gift. If investors are risk-averse, they can simply stay out of Bitcoin and invest in other assets. The upside potential outweighs the risk for this group.MinersI'm not a mining expert. But if I became a miner, I would want to have a somewhat reliable estimate about the expected return from my hardware investment. Such a calculation gets very difficult when Bitcoin volatility is high. For miners, a high Bitcoin volatility means more risk than opportunity. If prices are on a temporary decline, miners can't wait forever for a recovery. Mining difficulty could get too high in the meantime.MerchantsShops and e-commerce businesses make a living from selling goods and services. They are fully occupied with improving their products and their marketing. Managing exchange rate fluctuations isn't their field of expertise. It would be bad news for them if their profit margins deteriorated due to foreign exchange risk. And if you have someone managing FX, it costs you money. Merchants need a stable currency.Average Joe usersPeople who use Bitcoin simply to pay with it or to transfer money from one place to the other are a comparable to merchants . They use Bitcoin as a means to an end. When you use Bitcoin to send your earned money back home, you wouldn't like the fact that it lost much of its value before your family could convert Bitcoins to their local currency. Surely, they would be happy about a value appreciation. But probably not at the expense of a high risk that their savings might lose value. For three of the mentioned groups, a high Bitcoin volatility is not desirable. Some might argue, that since Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, it is more likely that these people will profit from a rising Bitcoin value than suffer losses. This might be true in the long term. But if you want to use Bitcoin as a means of payment on a daily basis, you don't have this long term perspective. You can get badly hurt from short term price swings. So for most of us, high Bitcoin volatility is a foe. And again, appreciation and volatility are not the same thing. If the price went up by 1 every day, then volatility would be 0. Even though the Bitcoin value would skyrocket. Therefore, one condition for Bitcoin to succeed as a widely-used currency is, that its exchange rate volatility keeps declining. And if Bitcoin succeeds as a currency, it will also succeed as an asset.4. Bitcoin volatility outlookThis article so far has not treated the causes behind the Bitcoin volatility development. Large price swings are the result of either high volume selling or buying. The motivations behind trading activities are complex and only rarely obvious. News are usually one of many factors. But in this regard, if you understand the past, it doesn't say too much about the future. Unless you can predict news bites. One thing that definitely has a measurable impact on volatility is market volume and liquidity. The last chart of this article shows how many Bitcoins have been traded on Mt.Gox against the US Dollar as a share of total Bitcoins in circulation on a daily basis.Data sources: blockchain.info; own calculationsAs the chart shows, an amount that exceeds 1 of total Bitcoins in circulation is traded frequently just against the US Dollar and just on Mt.Gox. This excludes all other currencies Bitcoin is traded against and all other exchanges where Bitcoins are traded. So if we were to sum up the entire trading volume and related it to the amount of Bitcoins in circulation, the share should be significantly higher. And values above 1 are already quite high if you compare this to a stock for instance. But there is also a development visible. The amount of daily traded Bitcoins as a percentage of total Bitcoins is falling. For one thing, the peak days have diminished since mid 2012.One factor for this fall could be increasing Bitcoin market capitalization. The more all Bitcoins are worth, the less one single trade impacts the market price (ceteris paribus). There is almost a circular reference. As long as Bitcoin volatility is high, new users are less likely to participate. But the more users there are, the easier it gets to convince new users because of a smaller volatility.The three charts we have looked at unveil a tendency of declining Bitcoin volatility. If this is a real trend, I wish it was here to stay. I'm cautiously optimistic about it. With roughly USD 1.5 bn market capitalization Bitcoin is still on a low level. That's less than the smallest S&P500 company (Intel for instance has a market cap of USD 110 bn) and about one third of the money supply of Uganda. Both, small cap stocks and currencies of small countries are known to be volatile. Exactly because of the impact single trades can have on market prices. My retained optimism comes from the growing Bitcoin user base. Users drive demand and demand increases market cap. In this chain of events volatility declines and Bitcoin can succeed.",

    "title": "The Silk Road, the largest black market site on the Tor network, has been shut down by the United States’",
    "text": "The Silk Road, the largest black market site on the Tor network, has been shut down by the United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation, and its alleged owner, Ross William Ulbrecht, arrested in San Francisco and charged with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. With the closure of the site, the FBI has also made the largest seizure of bitcoins, or indeed Bitcoin-related funds, to date: 26000 BTC, or $3.6 million.Ross Ulbricht appears to have a public LinkedIn profile, where he describes himself as an “investment adviser and entrepreneur” who “love[s] learning and using theoretical constructs to better understand the world around me” and now wishes to “use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and agression amongst mankind.” “Just as slavery has been abolished most everywhere,” he writes, “I believe violence, coercion and all forms of force by one person over another can come to an end. The most widespread and systemic use of force is amongst institutions and governments, so this is my current point of effort. The best way to change a government is to change the minds of the governed, however. To that end, I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.”Unfortunately for Ulbricht, it seems like it is systemic force that is giving people a first-hand experience of what it is like to live in a world without him. However, the online drug community is unlikely to fall apart, in much the same way that the filesharing community only grew stronger once Napster disappeared. Black Market Reloaded, located at http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion (link works using the Tor browser only) is currently the main alternative, with Sheep Market at http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion coming up as a close second. The loss of Silk Road will likely give rise to many more sites springing up in its wake, especially with the open source BitWasp project providing operators with a codebase to start from. Perhaps we may even see a decentralized alternative, which will survive without any central bottleneck that could be taken down. But the biggest problem in the short term will be trust. Over the past two and a half years, there have been many reputations formed on the site and recorded on Silk Road’s database, and much of this information is now gone. On the positive side, however, Silk Road has always supported sellers and buyers getting into contact with each other over email, and most reputable sellers have GPG public keys, meaning that they can still send messages that others can verify came from them, and thus maintain their reputations as the drug community moves to other sides.Cryptic ConsequencesFor crypto-economy enthusiasts, there are two main questions. First, how did Ulbricht get caught? In a Forbes article on the subject, Alex Konrad writes: “The full complaint linked to above is worth a read, but it appears that agents found Ulbricht after Canadian border authorities routinely checked a package intended for his San Francisco home and discovered nine fake identification cards within, which Ulbricht allegedly was seeking to obtain to rent more servers to power Silk Road as it massively expanded.” From here, we can see two large mistakes. First, Dread Pirate Roberts did far too much himself. The number one rule of staying hidden is, well, being hidden. Purchasing a large number of servers with fake ID is exactly the wrong the thing to do. The correct solution would have been to do only the sensitive wallet and private information handling in-house and outsource as much as possible to third parties. Second, Dread Pirate Roberts actually stayed inside the United States, the single most hostile jurisdiction with regard to drug policy, the whole time.But there is also another piece of evidence mentioned in the complaint. In early 2011, a forum user “altoid” made posts on shroomery.org and bitcointalk.org attempting to generate interest in the site; “Has anyone seen Silk Road yet?”, one post reads, “It’s kind of like an anonymous amazon.com. I don’t think they have heroin on there, but they are selling other stuff…” Later on, altoid on Bitcointalk made a post on the forum asking for an “IT pro in the Bitcoin community” to hire in connection with “a venture backed Bitcoin startup company”, asking interested users to reply to “rossulbricht at gmail dot com”. This pattern is a common one seen in cryptography: systems like public key cryptography, Tor and Bitcoin are proven time and time again to be robust, and even the criminal complaint points out that Tor makes it “practically impossible” to physically locate users or servers and mentions Silk Road’s internal Bitcoin “tumbler” used to further anonymize users; rather, it is always through some non-technical mistake that the information gets leaked. Being a crypto-entrepreneur is a full-time job; it is simply too risky to run any kind of substantial anonymous operation by night and be an ordinary businessman by day.Second, are the users themselves safe? The answer here is, it depends. Most professional sellers use GPG public key encryption, so those buyers who know how to use GPG can send their private shipping data to sellers such that any intermediaries only see it in an encrypted format. Those who have not figured out how to use GPG, however, may be in trouble. In theory, Silk Road deletes the info as soon as possible. However, it is entirely possible that the major drug sites currently left standing, Black Market Reloaded and Sheep Market, has already been compromised by law enforcement, which is monitoring and recording any shipping information that buyers put in. Thus, what this case shows clearly is just how valuable easy-to-use client side encryption software can be; if the Tor browser had included some kind of GPG utility by default, this issue would be much less consequential (although full safety is impossible since law enforcement can always create their own fake seller accounts to harvest data even without compromising the site, and various kinds of man-in-the-middle attacks are possible if users are not careful about which key they encrypt with). Ultimately, the only truly secure Silk Road will likely come in the form of some kind of plugin to Bitmessage.Not Such A Perfect MartyrUnfortunately, those who see Dread Pirate Roberts as a martyr for the cause of personal freedoms with respect to psychoactive substances will be sorely disappointed. According to the complaint, Ulbrecht is not just a drug marketplace operator; he was also responsible for murder, or at least attempted murder, by proxy. The complaint begins:Beginning on March 13, 2013, a Silk Road vendor known as “FriendlyChemist” began sending threats to DPR through Silk Road’s private message system. In these messages, FriendlyChemist states that he had a long list of real names and addresses of Silk Road vendors and customers that he had obtained from hacking into the computer of another, larger Silk Road vendor. FriendlyChemist threatened to publish the information on the internet unless DPR gave him $500,000, which FriendlyChemist indicated he needed to pay off his narcotics suppliers.Over the next few days, FriendlyChemist leaked enough of the information to convince DPR that he was serious. On March 27, he wrote to Silk Road member redandwhite:In my eyes, FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn’t mind if he was executed … I’m not sure how much you already know about the guy, but I have the following info and am waiting on his address.The victim was a resident of White Rock, British Columbia, Canada, and had a wife and three children. On March 29:I would like to put a bounty on his head if it isn’t too much trouble for you. What would be an adequate amount to motivate you to find him?A payment of 1670 BTC (~$150,000) was soon sent and soon after that redandwhite updated: “Your problem has been taken care of. Rest assured he won’t be blackmailing anyone ever again. Ever.” It appears that redandwhite sent a picture to confirm the kill, which DPR received, confirmed and deleted. However, Canadian law enforcement does not have evidence of any Canadian resident with the victim’s name, or of any death in White Rock around that time; we may need to wait a while longer before that particular mystery gets resolved.However, there is also a second complaint, this time from the state of Maryland, that DPR also paid for another hit, this time for a crime much smaller than intending to release thousands of names and addresses to the public and law enforcement for potential arrest. The complaint reads:> DPR communicated with the undercover cop via the Internet, and told the UC that the Employee had been arrested by law enforcement [earlier this employee had been the victim of an undercover sting operation] and that the Employee had stolen funds from other Silk Road users. DPR asked the undercover cop to arrange for the employee to be beaten and forced to return the money, stating specifically: “I’d like him beat up, then forced to return the bitcoins he stole back, like sit him down at his computer and make him do it.”But then things got worse:> Can you change the order to execute rather than torture? … [the Employee] was on the inside for a while, and now that he’s arrested I’m afraid he’ll give up info … [I have] never killed a man before, but it is the right move in this case.After some negotiation before the “hit”, the undercover cop created and sent DPR several staged photos of the victim being “tortured” and “killed”. DPR’s words after the kill included:> [I’m] a little disturbed, but I’m OK. I’m new to this kind of thing is all … I don’t think I’ve done the wrong thing … I’m sure I’ll call on you again at some point, though I hope I won’t have to. > I’m pissed I had to kill him, but what’s done is done … I just can’t believe he was so stupid … I wish more people had some integrityLooking ForwardSo what will the future be? In the near and mid-term future, we can certainly expect to see others opening up drug sites, taking Silk Road’s demise as an opportunity. Research into infrastructure like decentralized webs of trust is likely to increase; just like the successor to Napster was the decentralized BitTorrent, the true successor to Silk Road will likely need to be decentralized as well. Will it happen? The tools are out there. BitMessage exists, Namecoin, so all the ingredients for a web of trust are in place. The next level will be to set up a decentralized marketplace. That is simply a matter of creating a simple application-specific message protocol on top of BitMessage and then creating a graphical user interface for it. The web of trust, necessary to combat fraud, will also need to become a decentralized protocol. If someone wants to implement it all, they can.As for Bitcoin itself, however, there will be another big question: will Bitcoin survive the loss of Silk Road? There are many who claim that the practical value of Bitcoin is essentially entirely that of buying drugs with it; if Silk Road goes down, and Bitcoin prospers, that will be the ultimate definitive proof that that is false. Indeed, the loss of Silk Road may even make Bitcoin more palatable to mainstream businesses and accelerate adoption, as the arrest may placate law enforcement agencies around the world and make them believe that Bitcoin’s anonymity is not as strong as they may have previously believed. Bitcoin’s public relations department is succeeding at sending the right message to law enforcement already; the complaint did not make any significant attempt to criticize Bitcoin and even specifically said: “Bitcoins are not illegal in and of themselves and have known legitimate uses”.Furthermore, with the recent collapse of MtGox’s market share, the Bitcoin economy has lost one of its major centralized points of failure, and now that Silk Road too is gone it is difficult to see if Bitcoin has any truly centralized points left. Nearly every service now has replacements that are comparable to it in size – in the exchange market, MtGox and BitStamp, in the payment processor market BitPay, Coinbase and BIPS, and in the crypto-drug market Black Market Reloaded and Sheep Market, so once the shock of the loss of Silk Road passes the economy will actually be less vulnerable to individual shocks going forward.It has long been said that crypto-anonymity is only something that functions well at small scales; the larger one gets, the harder it becomes to untraceably mix one’s bitcoins, the larger one’s real-world trace becomes, and the larger the incentive for law enforcement and blackmailers alike to look through the evidence and search for weaknesses. Today, it was fake IDs and an email address. Tomorrow, it may be one’s writing style. Later on, it might be a correllation between one’s home electricity and internet bandwidth usage and one’s forum login records. But then again, as the state of the current financial system reminds us all too well, maybe the impossibility of staying private and getting too big, and the traceability that Bitcoin offers at such scales as compared to centralized systems, is actually generally a good thing.",

    "title": "Conferences have become a big part of the Bitcoin community this year. Over a thousand people came to the Bitcoin",
    "text": "Conferences have become a big part of the Bitcoin community this year. Over a thousand people came to the Bitcoin conference in San Jose, and nearly every month since then we have seen some kind of Bitcoin event. We had Porcfest in June, BTC London and the Inside Bitcoins conference in July, and the regulatory compliance conference in New York in August. And this month, although it has not been nearly so widely publicized, there will be a Bitcoin conference as well, located in Amsterdam from September 26 to 28. The details for the event can be found on the conference’s website.The organizers of the conference would like the see their event have a somewhat different character from the ones that came before it. “It’s an open source conference,” explains Matthew Wright, one of the chief organizers behind the event, “it’s not a moneygrab and tap dance of self-importance by those who seek to centralize and ‘get rich quick'”. The sentiment is common among Bitcoin users in mainland Europe that the Bitcoin community in the US is focusing too heavily on integrating with mainstream finance, securing large profits and investments and, some would add, bending backwards to regulatory authorities to make Bitcoin seem more friendly to established institutions; rather, many Europeans believe, Bitcoin’s potential to bootstrap a grassroots economy should be emphasized. When asked specifically what this anti-corporatist sentiment means in practice, Moe Levin writes:We’re trying to be different. We’ve done market research on attendees and saw that people wanted to see more devs, more entrepreneurs, and more of the people that are not “getting rich quick”. they want to see people with good ideas, working on them, and succeeding in making the community a better place. We have some big players in the bitcoin community speaking. No getting around that when you want to make a large event and attract attendees, but we’ve moved to invite the people that others can learn from and share experiences with, not the people that are interested in self-promotion. We have rigorous guidelines for speakers and their topics, and have asked for revisions of their speeches if they are too much of an ad for them. Think of it more of a TEDxBitcoin conference than a Bitcoin conference.The conference certainly has plenty of big players inside the Bitcoin community, although the European side dominates to an extent not seen in London or San Jose; Trezor, Bitsofproof, Bex.io, OpenTransactions, BitPay, Coinbase and BitStamp are perhaps the most prominent names on the list. Outside of the Bitcoin community, on the regulatory front the organizers managed to bring in Wieske Ebben, a policy maker from the Dutch National Bank, and Niels Ploeger from the Amsterdam police. The other major non-Bitcoin-specific attendees are likely to come on the entertainment side; Juice Rap News, a group that releases satirical news broadcasts based on current events in a rap style and has received over 200 bitcoins in donations since they first started accepting them, is interested in attending, and Maxmin may come as well.What is most interesting about what Levin and Wright are doing is actually not the conference itself; in fact, Wright argues, an excessive attention on “conferences” can be counterproductive. “Yearly conferences are great for publicity but not very useful in bringing bitcoin to markets,” Wright explains, “In fact, it works against it by putting it upon a pedestal as if it were some overly complicated technology that needs a conference just to understand”. Rather, the two want to build “marketplaces” in countries all around the world. “The future of the bitcoin conferences,” Levin writes. “We’re thinking Qatar. Montreal. Korea. something lite. A convention, involving people outside of Bitcoin”. These events would take place in each city every month, and would be a hybrid between weekly meetups, Satoshi Square events and traditional conferences; they would be aimed not so much at experienced Bitcoin users discussing theoretical topics in Bitcoin, but rather toward new users interested in learning more about Bitcoin, as well as new and experienced users alike actually using it in real life, and connecting people together to get things done. “We lead in with a conference/convention,” Wright explains, “but we leave the groundwork for a monthly marketplace.”For now, though, the only thing that is set in stone is the Amsterdam conference itself; even if Levin and Wright’s more long-term plans fizzle, the conference will still be valuable to the Bitcoin community; in fact, it will be only the second major Bitcoin event ever to happen in mainland Europe, the first being the November 2011 convention in Prague. A considerably number of people will be attending, from both Europe and the United States alike. Hope you can come!",

    "title": "Erik Voorhees is one of the foremost Bitcoin entrepreneurs and has helped build some critical parts of the Bitcoin business",
    "text": "Erik Voorhees is one of the foremost Bitcoin entrepreneurs and has helped build some critical parts of the Bitcoin business ecosystem, as well as being a loud advocate for a free, decentralised and voluntary currency. When the history of Bitcoin is written, he will be remembered as one of the brave few explorers ready to set out into the unknown and risk life and fortune to create a new world.Bitcoin Magazine: You discovered Bitcoin in May 2011... how? where?Erik Voorhees: It was fairly innocuous, but had profound consequences! I was cruising Facebook and saw a friend’s post that mentioned some weird currency that had appreciated by a gazillion percent since the prior October. I clicked the link, read about this thing called Bitcoin, and dismissed it outright as preposterous. Fake internet money didn’t appeal to me. Then I read more, and more, and I found an elegant answer to each skeptical question that popped into my mind. After a couple hours, I was utterly hooked, and realized it would change the world and I better figure out what the hell it’s all about.That day was one of the most important days of my life. It was like discovering some great truth, like seeing the future. I quit everything I was doing and jumped down the rabbit hole.BM: What is the most important feature of Bitcoin in your opinion?EV: This is a very good question. The most important feature is the fact that Bitcoin is decentralized, that it does not have any person or group of people who control it. It is from this feature that all the societal ramifications can occur, because a monetary system without a company or group of people behind it cannot be shut off. There is no office to raid, no server farm to close. Bitcoin is thus politically neutral. It excludes nobody, it has no geographical restrictions, it doesn’t make judgments on its usage. It has no terms of service. Bitcoin is a pure technological tool which will necessarily revolutionize society and finally separate money and state. The decentralized nature is what enables all this magic.BM: Many people have problems trusting a decentralised system founded by an anonymous programmer… can you explain the significance of Bitcoin being an open source project?EV: Yeah that’s easy… open source means you don’t need to trust anyone. Just go read the code. Thus the creator of Bitcoin is irrelevant, there is no need to care what his intentions were or what kind of person he was. There is no need to fear some secret scam is occurring.You mention that some people have problems trusting a decentralized system, but why? Because there is nobody in charge? Because there is no person who dictates the rules? This is precisely why you CAN trust it. It’s often quoted that a nation should be based on laws and not on men, because men can be corrupted, are fallible, and are often unpredictable. Bitcoin is this principle applied to money: it is a money of laws – mathematical laws – and not of men. This is why it has earned, rightly, the trust of some many enthusiasts.BM: Miners, gamblers, hackers and smugglers… is Bitcoin the Wild West online? Will it become boring once it goes mainstream?EV: Bitcoin is absolutely the Wild West of finance, and thank goodness. It represents a whole legion of adventurers and entrepreneurs, of risk takers, inventors, and problem solvers. It is the frontier. Huge amounts of wealth will be created and destroyed as this new landscape is mapped out. I believe the effects of this adventure will be profound, for while the “Wild West” was a uniquely American phenomenon, Bitcoin is a global one.Will a mainstream Bitcoin be boring? Perhaps by definition it will be, just as electricity is boring to us today, while at the turn of the last century it was hugely exciting. And of course, just as electricity, which is now boring, enabled the creation of unlimited new, exciting projects (including Bitcoin!), so too will Bitcoin enable a world of new innovation for many years to come.BM: What first gave you the idea to create SatoshiDice? How would you describe your experience running the site this past year?EV: I didn’t create SatoshiDice, but I am involved with it. To be honest, my experience has not been as pleasant as it should have been, for being an American citizen is a huge liability, and I worry constantly that the US Government will harm me in some way.The past year has shown me that America is not the land of free markets and free people that it was advertised to be in Government schools when I was growing up. America’s government has grown into an abhorrent apparatus that steals, harms, and imprisons people who have harmed nobody. At best, it seizes half the wealth you earn or makes you dependent on the wealth it has seized from others, and at worst, it ruins or ends your life.The amount I’ve spent on lawyers just trying to navigate the absurd legal system is enough to feed hundreds of families in a third world country on a continual basis.In short, my experience as an entrepreneur in “the land of the free and home of the brave,” both regarding SatoshiDice and in my other projects, has taught me that America is a lie. It has become a pathetic fiefdom, and I wish Americans would wake the hell up and see what’s happening.BM: Some people criticise SatoshiDice for “spamming” the network… what would you say to them? If Bitcoin is to scale, shouldn’t it be able to take this traffic and more?EV: Yes there is a number of people who hate me and hate SatoshiDice because it has caused so many transactions on the network. They call it spam because they believe their transactions are more legitimate than mine, and thus mine are spam. Apparently it’s okay to send “some” Bitcoin transactions, but if you send “too many” then that’s a no-no. “Too many” has never been defined, of course.Further, SatoshiDice pays the standard Bitcoin fee for every single transaction, and in this way has paid more to support the mining network than everyone else, combined. Critics retort that there are other externalities caused by SatoshiDice. Well that is true, and Bitcoin better fix that problem, and it will. I’ve offered non-trivial sums of money to people to work on and figure out good solutions, but this stuff takes time.In the end, haters gonna hate.BM: You hold Bitcoins, but also gold and silver. Is it fair to call Bitcoin a gold standard for the Internet?EV: I do love gold and silver as money, because I know why they make excellent money (tl;dr it’s because of their specific properties). Bitcoin’s specific properties similarly make it an amazing money. And while Bitcoin is certainly new and hasn’t withstood the test of time (like gold), some of its properties are far superior to metals in terms of monetary usage. Primarily, one cannot send gold instantly anywhere, period. This makes it very poor for modern commerce. While it’s true that a digital gold-backed currency could exist, the fact is that introduces severe counter-party risk on the part of the backer. E-gold is the perfect example of this, because as soon as the government gets angry about how e-gold is used, it shuts it off and arrests the owners (land of the free).So while precious metals make excellent money, they do have some problems. Bitcoin has problems also, of course. Neither are perfect, but in general gold and Bitcoin highly complement each others’ weaknesses. Anyone who believes in free and open markets and individual rights should have a very warm disposition toward both precious metals and Bitcoin.BM: Can Bitcoin be divorced from its political implications? Can it be “just a payment system”?EV: Interesting question. I think while the Bitcoin system, as a technology, is “apolitical,” its ramifications cannot be divorced from politics or society at large. And while a socialist might rightly hail Bitcoin as an equalizing force (it is), the truth is that it equals out peoples’ rights, not the result of their behavior. In other words, Bitcoin is highly individualistic, and robs power away from collectives and puts it in the hand of each person who cares to hold it.Beyond this, if Bitcoin succeeds it will inevitably cede power from governments, because much of a government’s power comes from its ability to print and control the currency that its subjects use. I think it would be hard to argue that Bitcoin would pull society away from individual liberty, and as such it is very much a libertarian technology. Socialists have every right to use it of course, but they may find that by doing so they enable everyone else to use their own money in the way that they personally see fit. This is the antithesis of collectivism, and will hugely undermine the coercive power of the State.BM: When will we see the first major government attacks on Bitcoin? How much damage can they really do?EV: I think governments see Bitcoin as a problem in terms of money laundering, drugs, tax evasion, etc. For this, they will try to regulate it more closely. They will not try to downright attack Bitcoin for these offenses. What they will attack it for is when they realize that those offenses are just a distraction… for the real power of Bitcoin is that it will increasingly compete with government fiat currency. Bitcoin will pull in more and more business and incrementally the actors using it will discover less and less need for dollars or euros or yen. This happens gradually. At some point, however, the government will realize that this made-up magic internet money is wresting power away from their anointed currencies and they will then come down hard. When will this happen? I have no idea, but I imagine it will be too late, because it probably already is.It’s also important to remember that not all governments will act in tandem. It’s possible that one regime will assault Bitcoin while others will be agnostic and others may even encourage it. Those regimes that clamp down hardest will simply squeeze an increasing amount of commerce over to those regimes that are friendly. Profits seek the path of least resistance and digital, frictionless currency is that path. Governments which attempt to abort this process will hamstring their competitiveness, and I fully expect some of them to be this foolish.BM: How many Bitcoin users are there right now in your estimation? When do you think that we will reach 10 million users, and what will it take to get us there?EV: My guess here is pretty anectodal and unscientific, but I’d say there are a few million people who have used Bitcoin in some way. Then maybe 500k-1m who use it occasionally, and maybe a couple hundred thousand who use it frequently. Ten million “occasional” users will likely be reached within two years and that’s probably about one order of magnitude higher than today.What will it take to get us there? More of the same. More businesses, easier tools, better security, and a sprinkling of time and luck.BM: What is the most urgent infrastructure that the Bitcoin ecosystem needs right now?EV: Bitcoin needs better ways to buy and sell Bitcoins quickly. In the US, BitInstant and CoinBase do a reasonable job, but it needs to be better and more specifically faster. And while the US is in the “reasonable” category, elsewhere in the world needs much better ways to buy and sell quickly. The ability to move in and out of Bitcoin in a frictionless manner is what allows the magic to happen – it’s what lends utility to the payment system aspect, and the payment system is what gives the currency its value.",

    "title": "Conformal, a company focused on building open-source software for privacy and security, has revealed their latest project: btcd, a full",
    "text": "Conformal, a company focused on building open-source software for privacy and security, has revealed their latest project: btcd, a full Bitcoin reimplementation in Google’s programming language Go. The implementation is not yet entirely done, but most core features such as transaction verification, database interaction and network connectivity are tested as working, and the company has released one component of the system for public review: btcwire, a package that focuses on converting Bitcoin protocol messages between btcd’s internal representation of the message and a serialized form suited for direct network transmission, as well as actually sending and receiving these messages over network connections. Conformal provides a more detailed description of btcwire on their website.The company has also written a blog post explaining their decision to make this alternative implementation; they write:A number of us at Conformal Systems had been keeping an eye on Bitcoin as passive observers for the past couple years since Bitcoin combines technologies that are already of interest to us: practical use of cryptography, distributed systems, and electronic payments. In January 2013 I had one of our developers, David Hill, attempt to port bitcoind and its GUI to Bitrig, an OS that several of our developers forked from OpenBSD. David encountered several problems with porting to Bitrig and in the process found issues with unit tests, non-portable functions and seeding of a PRNG. While pushing to get the port complete, it was clear that it would take a lot more effort than usual to complete this port. After seeing these issues with the porting, I felt that the Bitcoin ecosystem could use an alternative to bitcoind.As for why they chose the programming language Go, they write that Go has a number of advantages over the C++ used by the only full Bitcoin implementation currently in major use, bitcoind. Particularly importantly for financial software, Go offers “integrated test infrastructure, no active memory management, standard formatting, platform independent code, simpler parallelism, built-in profiling and documentation facilities [and is] virtually crash-proof.” Integrated test infrastructure is particularly important; the easier and more natural it is to write tests, the more tests can be written, and the smaller the chance we will see another serious blockchain fork from an unforeseen edge case. Parallelism, profiling and crash-proofness are also particularly useful attributed for Bitcoin exchanges, so given the performance bottlenecks that all exchanges were revealed to have in the Bitcoin market crash in April new exchange developers may well consider using Go as their language of choice.This is not the first attempt at reimplementing the Bitcoin protocol; Amir Taaki’s libbitcoin (written in C++) and Mike Hearn’s BitcoinJ (Java) have both accomplished the feat, although the former is being used only in some experimental versions of the Electrum server software and the latter in some Android light clients. Importantly, there are no alternative implementations of Bitcoin that are currently being used to any significant degree by miners.There are reasons to believe that this is unhealthy for the Bitcoin ecosystem. In theory, Bitcoin is an open source protocol in which anyone can participate, and on most levels that is true. Partial implementations of Bitcoin that can make and verify transactions exist already, and are the backbone of alternative Bitcoin clients like Blockchain and Electrum. In practice, the deeper into the protocol one goes the more it becomes a monoculture, but monocultures are dangerous. If there is only one implementation being widely used, then unforeseen bugs appearing (or even disappearing) in upgrades can cause the entire Bitcoin blockchain to essentially fork into two as the two versions of the protocol disagree on which transactions and blocks are valid and which are not. Because the blockchain builds on itself, even one mistake will have consequences that cascade forever into the future.This was the cause behind the blockchain fork that took place in March – a previously unknown limitation in the database software used by bitcoind 0.7 caused a fork only after bitcoin 0.8, which used a different database which did not have this limitation, was released. The two versions then disagreed on the validity of a single block, and the fork followed from there, sending the price crashing by 23 before enough major mining pools got together on IRC chat to correct the issue. With three or five re-implementations, on the other hand, any single version disagreeing with the others will be highly inconvenient for users of that version, but will not have a grave effect on the entire network.Multiple implementations is also good for standardization; in a monoculture, the dominant software becomes the standard, giving the developers of the dominant software a higher degree of control over the future development of the protocol than was originally intended. This does not even require the developers to make a conscious decision to start subverting the design process for personal gain to be harmful. Even if, as is almost certainly the case today, developers are acting with the best of intentions, there is a bias in software development toward increasing complexity and confusion that is mitigated if multiple implementations have to work together on every change. If there is only one implementation, errors get uncovered later rather than sooner, and the result is a sort of Talebian “stability breeding its own instability” that ultimately, as in the case of the March blockchain fork, causes disaster. Additionally, developers have no incentive to even document the protocol as long as it works internally. Currently documentation does exist on the Bitcoin wiki, but with multiple implementations we can be much more certain that the page will be updated, and even improve in quality, in the future.Whether or not btcd will actually be used by miners is hard to say; it is entirely possible that miners will remain comfortable with the existing bitcoind, and the stability through decentralization that a healthy ecosystem of alternative implementations can bring will never come to pass. But even in such a state, this will still be a step forward for Bitcoin if only because it makes it easier for Go users to interact with the protcol. A Bitcoin implementation in Go has already been written, but it has not been updated in nearly a year, and appears to have only ever had a single developer behind it. btcd is backed by a corporation that is clearly well-versed in security and privacy, inspiring much more confidence in its reliability.For the near future, Conformal writes that “our goal is to continue releasing packages from btcd as we increase test coverage and bring them up to a professional level. The intent is that each piece can then be publicly reviewed for correctness as they become available while we continue work on the remaining packages.” The company intends to continue releasing packages over the next several weeks, pushing out one at a time so that the community can better review the packages as they come out. Their next release will be btcjson, a package the deals with JSON-RPC messages. You can watch out for more releases on the Conformal blog.",

    "text": "Clearly Canadian, a popular North American premium sparkling water brand, has announced that they are going to be re-opening today, and will be accepting Bitcoin as a payment method. Clearly Canadian is a 30 year old company, whose products were very popular in the 1980s and 1990s, and is especially well known for its flavored sparkling water products including flavors such as wild cherry, green apple, mountain blackberry and even sparkling tea. Since then, the company’s founding management exited in the early 2000s, and for the next decade the company sank into relative obscurity, although the brand remains well-known among older generations of Canadians. Now, however, Clearly Canadian is intent on making a comeback. Today the company relaunched its website, offering what were four of its most popular flavors, and has announced a leaders referral program to get the word out. At the same time, however, Clearly Canadian is intent on recapturing the Canadian (and, of course, American) audience with a new feature: accepting Bitcoin.Although flavored sparkling water is not a product that is typically associated with Bitcoin users, the Clearly Canadian brand is clearly recognizable to millions of people, making it one of the more prominent, and mainstream, businesses to start accepting Bitcoin. Yet another major merchant to add on to an ever growing list.The full press release is as follows:Ambassador Brand of Canada accepting Bitcoin in global online campaign. (Richmond Hill, ON) Dec. 16, 2013, – Clearly Canadian, in keeping with the ever evolving digital age, is opening up its coming online pre-sales campaign to the global bitcoin community. “Online virtual currencies are clearly here to stay – no pun intended”, according to Mitch Callahan, Clearly Canadian’s Bitcoin Campaign Manager. “Just as Clearly Canadian pioneered the new age beverage industry in the ‘80s and ‘90s…bitcoin, in a much more profound way, is poised to change how we all transact business on a global scale and in our daily lives. Clearly Canadian finds that truly exciting and we are proud to be a new emerging member of the bitcoin community.”",

    "text": "For the past seven months, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) have been the central focus of Bitcoin mining development. Ever since Butterfly Labs became the first company to publicly announce its upcoming ASIC technology in June 2012, four startup companies have been in a race to be the first to release the technology. Now, it looks like the race finally has a winner: Avalon. On January 19, the countdown timer which the company had boldly placed on its website weeks before has reached zero, and within hours, the company sent off its first batch of 300 mining rigs to its customers. The units are currently being shipped from China, and, Avalon founder Yifu Guo believes, units should start arriving at customers' doorsteps at the beginning of February.The specifications of the devices are somewhat less impressive than what Butterfly Labs has been promising. The most basic statistics, price and hashrate, are the same, with both companies offering 60 GH/s for $1,299. Going deeper into the features, though, there are significant differences. While Butterfly Labs' line of SC devices, with the exception of its 1500 GH/s \"Mini Rig\", is able to fit inside a ten-centimeter cube, one of Avalon's machines is as large as a typical desktop computer - a space inefficiency that the company was forced to pay dearly for with shipping costs of $150 per device. Compared to Butterfly Labs' promised power efficiency of 1.2 watts per GH/s, Avalon is offering 6W per GH/s - still nearly an order of magnitude of improvement over existing FPGA hardware, but nevertheless not nearly as efficient as what Butterfly Labs customers are expecting. Avalon's technical specifications are also generally inferior; Guo admits, for example, that Butterfly Labs' manufacturing process used a wavelength (a measure roughly comparable to the size of chip features) of 65nm, but Avalon used the relatively coarser 110nm.However, Avalon easily makes up for all of these deficiencies with one overwhelming advantage: so far, they are the only ones to have actually shipped a product. Avalon's main three competitors, ASICMiner, Butterfly Labs and bASIC, all originally promisedshipping dates in October or November, but as of today, none of them have even demonstrated a functional product. ASICMiner is perhaps the closest to getting its machines working, but there is reason to believe that even it may be in worse shape than it appears. \"There are some oddities with their announcements,\" Guo explains. Normally, computer chip manufacturing facilities produce a \"yield\" of 95% - that is, less than 5% of the chips that come out of the foundry are imperfect in some way. For ASICMiner's chip production, the company's customer service representative reported, the number of failed chips is as high as 30%. In theory, all this means is that the manufacturer will need to make 43% more chips to compensate, but the abnormality hints at the possibility of other problems to come.ASICMiner has been relatively quiet about the reasons for most of their delays, although the latest - from mid-January to late March - was caused by a combination of internal business difficulties and Chinese New Year celebrations ensuring that work could not be completed in the weeks leading up to, and immediately after, the actual holiday that falls this year on February 10. Butterfly Labs has announced multiple significant delays, and is currently sticking to a timeline that will have it shipping the week of February 10. The most recent delay was caused by a decision to change the technology that it uses to connect its integrated circuits to the rest of the processor. Its original plan had been to use the Quad Flat No-leads package (QFN) technology, but heat management issues forced them to reconsider and switch to the Flip Chip Ball Grid Array (FCBGA), a change which is difficult to make at such a late stage in development.Avalon, on the other hand, has seen its development process go extremely smoothly, and has even come out far ahead of schedule compared to their original scheduled release date of late February 2013. Since then, they have mostly pushed their deadline forward, rather than back, with two small exceptions: a single one-week delay that the company were able to predict over a month in advance, and a largely unnoticed, one-hour, delay after the countdown timer expired on January 19. Ironically, the latter delay was caused by the exact opposite problem to what Butterfly Labs is facing: Avalon needed to remove some fans from its hardware because its cooling system was doing its job too well.Aside from basic statistics, Avalon has also made a number of other features of its devices public. The machines will run on openWRT, an open source Linux operating system, and the mining software itself is simply cgminer combined with an Avalon-specific driver. This also means that the Avalon code is entirely open source; openWRT is available under the General Public License version 2, and cgminer is released under GPL version 3. The machine uses a standard ATX power supply, the same as that used by ordinary computers, and internet connectivity is provided via Ethernet and Wi-Fi.Configuring the machine will be possible either through SSH or a dedicated web interface, allowing users to easily set it up to mine with their preferred mining pool. Solo mining, however, is harder. Unlike pooled mining, where the miner receives the block headers needed by the mining algorithm directly, a solo miner needs to have an instance of bitcoind running locally or connected to the machine, which also requires storing the entire 6 GB Bitcoin blockchain. There are two ways to get around the issue. First, one can run an instance of bitcoind on a separate PC and configure the Avalon machine to work with it just as easily as one would a mining pool. Alternatively, there is also the option of running bitcoind on the machine directly, but that would require a USB flash drive to store the blockchain, as well as some special configuration to make bitcoind available on openWRT. This second option, while attractive, is thus much more difficult to implement and not supported “out of the box”. Mining with P2Pool presents a similar problem, although in that case there is a third workaround: connect to a public P2Pool node rather than running a node yourself.Altogether, Avalon's first batch is expected to contribute a total of 18 TH/s to the Bitcoin network - about eighty percent of the network's entire hash power at the time of Avalon's shipping. The network hash power is expected to ramp up slowly over the coming weeks, giving at least some Avalon customers a small window of opportunity to quickly earn back a significant portion of their investment before the network difficulty adjusts - and before Avalon's competitors catch up. The company's next batch is expected to come with 500 units on March 1, although with prices increased to $1,499 per machine, and yet undisclosed future upgrades are already in the works.Avalon founder Yifu Guo has agreed to share his thoughts on the ASIC mining industry, and what enabled him to succeed where others have failed.Vitalik: So when did you get into the ASIC business?Yifu Guo: It was March, 2012. Some hardware people, e.g. ngzhang, and I spoke about it, since it was technologically the next progression. We never stopped talking about it, but I'd say the serious work didn't begin until BFL announced their ASIC lineup. We didn't want a company obtaining monopoly, thus serious work began.Vitalik Buterin: well, now you have a monopoly - you're shipping almost as much as the current network, how do you feel about that?Yifu Guo: I don't like it frankly speaking. Technically the reality was supposed to be fairly different. BFL and bASIC were suppose to ship before me, and I was not expecting large demand due to their delays. Originally I was supposed to make this batch and sell chips, and provide the technology to more people, rather than making this a business. But alas, I've became what I've tried to prevent. With power comes responsibilities.Vitalik Buterin: Why do you think the other three major ASIC producers have been delayed so much?Yifu Guo: They don't have existing relationships with IC companies, is the short version.Vitalik Buterin: And you did right from the start?Yifu Guo: Yes, this is correct. I am involved heavily with the development process, as indicated by all the paperwork and stuff I've released, as are most people who are involved with Avalon but not on the IC team. Close communication made us. We never had a \"fuzzy\" date. I've known what was going on, when things are happening, what parts are coming in, what's being bought and etc. Hence I was able to give good promise on dates, knowing we would be a few days late a month earlier. This is our biggest advantage.Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, I saw that. Very precise of you. So what does your corporate structure look like?Yifu Guo: There isn't a clear \"company\" structure involved with it, but we are not new to product development, and we knew what skillset we needed, so we brought who and what we needed on board, and worked together do this project. There are parts we \"contracted\" it out, if you will; for example, we didn't CNC our cases ourselves, nor we had laser cutters, but we 3d modeled it, and somebody else converted it to a machine drawing for example. They were mostly friends, as you know that's how things work in Asia. Essentially the whole design is made by us, including the chip, it's the back-end and 110nm actualization that is done by the IC company, considering the actualization tools are expensive.Vitalik Buterin: So it's basically that they don't have close communication that's been causing BFL and bASIC to fall behind so much? Are there any other factors, in your opinion?Yifu Guo: I think a lot of the problems that came out were caused by a lack of communication. Remember how Inaba comes out and says something like, the chip is flawed, then the engineer Nasser comes out and says it's \"clock buffer problem\". Whether that's true or not, let's not talk about that, but the gap in communication indicated by this event is apparent. Or how Inaba is saying they are waiting on dates, or how bASIC is saying how they are waiting on dates. And in the case of bASIC, I really think they got scammed by whatever company they were working with, because I don't think Tom is technical at all, nor is Inaba. But I also don't think that's the point. How does it not raise a flag, as a person involved with a project to accept things like something being due today, but only to have a third party tell you that the new deadline is “30 days later”. That was Inaba addressing when the chips are coming out in December, and now they released a new timeline on how their chips are coming at the end of January. If it was me I wouldn't have accepted that kind of delay without getting some SERIOUS answers.Personally I'm often the one to press for explanation and answers in the development process because 1. I have the weakest knowledge in hardware compare to everyone else involved and 2. I handle public relations. So, back to the original problem, they were at the mercy of quoting dates from third parties, while we were always in control. That is, aside from Chinese New Year and some customs issue that delayed us, but we announced CNY issue the same day we announced the project, and the customs issue a month ahead.Vitalik Buterin: How did the shipping process go? When do you expect customers to receive the boxes?Yifu Guo: We underestimated the shipping cost by like $80 per unit and ran into some issues with customs, so we are already in the red from shipping costs this round and later than we planned. As for when they will arrive, depends on where the customers are, but I think 2 weeks or so.Vitalik Buterin: Alright then, thanks a lot for your answers. That was a really interesting conversation.Yifu Guo: Anytime.",

    "text": "Image credit: Josh Harvey, Porcfest 2012In 2012, Josh Harvey made a post on the Bitcointalk forum with the following title: “Porcfest 2012: Biggest Bitcoin Event Ever.” Porcfest is one of two annual summits hosted by the Free State Project, a libertarian movement in New Hampshire with over 1,000 active participants, most of whom moved to the state to take part. The event is a week-long gathering on a campsite in northern New Hampshire, and every day is filled with a collection of liberty-themed panel discussions, music and games, and throughout the week there is a marketplace called Agora Valley, where merchants typically accept silver and gold as payment in addition to US dollars (or, as the locals prefer to call them, “federal reserve notes”). In 2012, however, silver and gold were for the first time joined by their new upstart digital companion, with over 80 of merchants accepting Bitcoin as payment. “I talked to some of the ones that didn’t,” Harvey added, “and even they knew exactly what I was talking about. They were interested in doing it, but just hadn’t gotten set up yet.” This year, Bitcoin is expected to take on an even larger role at Porcfest. The Free State Project’s keystone charities, including Antiwar and the medical group Fr33Aid, have started taking Bitcoin donations, and the latter has even converted to being a purely Bitcoin-based organization.But what is this Free State Project that has let Bitcoin consume it to such a great extent? The underlying objective is simple. In 2001, a number of libertarian activists, disappointed with their failures to get anyone elected inside the United States’ Republican and Democrat-dominated federal government, decided to try a different strategy: find a state that is (i) already very free in both personal and economic matters, and (ii) has a low population, allowing for smaller groups to achieve significant change, and convince 20,000 people to move to that state to actively influence local politics in a libertarian direction. New Hampshire proved to be the perfect candidate; its current population is only 1.3 million, allowing 20,000 movers to have significant control over state politics simply by playing the dominant and evenly matched Republicans and Democrats against each other, and as far as freedom is concerned one must only look as far as the state’s motto: “Live Free or Die”.The libertarian appeal of New Hampshire can be seen from the moment one drives in; on one highway leading into the state, on the border there is a sign stating that wearing seatbelts is mandatory for those under 18 – that is, unlike every other state, only for those under 18, with the “Live Free or Die” motto written below. The state is quiet and secluded; although the large southern towns like Manchester, Portsmouth and Concord do have bus routes, huge swaths of the state are completely inaccessible by public transportation, making them ideal for those who simply want to live undisturbed and peaceful lives with their families or in small communities far away from the rest of civilization; this sort of idyllic, “down-to-earth”, ideology is especially popular in Graphton, which attracts libertarians with its lack of a building code. For those who enjoy the benefits of civilization, from Manchester Boston is only two hours away by bus. State politics is highly accessible, with 400 representatives in the New Hampshire State House of Representatives (of which about 20 are libertarians) making it easy for anyone to make their voice heard in government. There is no state income and sales tax, although the state makes up the difference via high property taxes – a highly successful partial implementation of a left-libertarian political philosophy known as Georgism.In my own travels through the state, one common sentiment I have heard is that people here tend to view the local government very favorably; it would be a truly ideal place to live “if only the feds would get out of the way”. And this has a strong ring of truth; from this author’s Canadian point of view, the federal government of the United States, with its bans on drinking alcohol or even entering many bars below age 21, requirements to show identification to board a bus, and constant DHS-funded reminders on TV telling people “if you see something, say something”, feels like a downright police state compared to the “True North Strong and Free”. Incidentally, the high age restriction on alcohol and bars has even led to me personally getting kicked out of a Bitcoin meetup here, although the meetup group was nice (and righteously angry) enough to relocate to a different location. Outside of libertarianism, the other main jarring thing about the United States to a Canadian is the sheer number of advertisements for various private and semi-private health care services.The Free State Project movement in New Hampshire is essentially centered around two cities: Manchester and Keene. Manchester is important because of its (relatively) large population of 110,000, and by libertarian standards it has its credibility; CNNMoney ranks Manchester as the 13th best city to live and launch a business, and Yahoo ranks it the first in its list of tax-friendly cities. There are no Bitcoin-accepting restaurants yet in Manchester, although Lamassu‘s Josh and Zach Harvey are (at least currently) located in the city and organize a weekly meetup with about seven to ten participants.Keene is the undisputed “liberty media capital of the world“, with Free Talk Live, LRN.FM (“Liberty Radio Network”) and ten other libertarian shows located there, but is also the home of a much more activist, and controversial, part of the local libertarian movement that focuses heavily on civil disobedience. Marijuana is sometimes involved, and at other times the target is local rules prohibiting filming in courts or distributing pamphlets on school property. A particularly popular (and, in this case, entirely legal) activity is “Robin Hooding”, a deliberate strategy to deprive the Keene government of revenue from parking tickets by following parking inspectors around and filling expired parking meters right before the inspectors come to check any particular spot. Other Free Staters often disagree with the “Keeniacs”‘ actions, seeing them as needlessly provoking the local government even when some of the rules the activists are targeting are downright reasonable. “I think some of the civil disobedience has been constructive and useful—and much of it has not been,” Free State Project founder Jason Sorens has said. If you wish to evaluate the merits of this side of the movement for yourself, consider watching their latest video Derrick J’s Victimless Crime Spree and making your own conclusions.The one Bitcoin-accepting restaurant currently in New Hampshire is the Pao Cafe in Newmarket, close to Portsmouth. The owner, Matt Corano, is himself part of the Free State Project, and is actively interested in Bitcoin for the ideological reasons. More will soon come; the Free Stater-owned Murphy’s Diner in Manchester may accept it if at least one of its suppliers can be convinced to, and a number of restaurants on Manchester’s Elm Street are potentially interested (although the Harveys are too busy with their Bitcoin ATM to spend too much time promoting Bitcoin adoption locally). But this is not to say that Bitcoin adoption is sparse; in fact, a very large number of people both in the Free State Project and elsewhere accept Bitcoin as payment for various kinds of services. The landlord I personally am staying with during my stay in New Hampshire, Alec Muller, accepts bitcoins for rent at a 20 discount, and Josh and Zach Harvey have managed to get a number of their graphic designers and suppliers to take them.The other attraction of southern New Hampshire, and Manchester in particular, is its proximity to Boston, a city which has a strong Bitcoin community itself. The main character in Boston is Jay Best, an MIT research affiliate who has put together a weekly Bitcoin meetup group with, just like in Manchester, about seven to ten participants. However, in other ways Best has been more successful. There are now two restaurants accepting Bitcoin, Thelonious Monkfish and Veggie Galaxy.See a few more pictures of Thelonious Monkfish and Veggie Galaxy hereThelonious Monkfish appears to be simply an ordinary Asian fusion restaurant, albeit a highly rated one that is fully seated within half an hour of opening its doors at 11:30 on Sunday. Veggie Galaxy is a vegetarian restaurant, featuring veggie burgers, “steaks”, salads, coconut-based cocktails and various kinds of vegan desserts. Both restaurants have plenty of high-quality options on the menu at a reasonable price, although it is possible to get unlucky. More Bitcoin-accepting places are soon to come; first in line are a café and a beer store, and both Best and other Bitcoin users are actively recruiting more. The ideological feel of the Bitcoin community is still largely libertarian, although a significant number are political moderates who like Bitcoin purely for its aspects of reducing transactional friction. The intent of the group is to simply focus on spreading Bitcoin adoption, as well as acting as a hotspot for Bitcoin activity; at the Bitcoin meetup last Friday, two people came to buy bitcoins from Best.Next week Bitcoin activity in Manchester and Boston will die down somewhat, as all the Bitcoiners will be heading over to Porcfest. The event will be taking place near Lancaster, NH, and tickets will be sold at the door for $75. Accomodations are heavily booked, so if you are not yet prepared to go your best bet may be either renting a room in a hotel 15km away or getting a tent and renting an RV spot. The local hotels and RV spots, unfortunately, do not accept Bitcoin. The first day of the fest will be tomorrow, although the more interesting events will take place later in the week.See you at Porcfest!",

    "text": "BTCGuild, currently the second largest mining pool with 17 of the network hashpower, started selling ASICMiner’s USB Block Erupter mining devices, but announced that it sold out their 1000 units within 40 minutes of opening up shop.ASICMiner is the Bitcoin economy’s largest mining company, and is responsible for 25 of the Bitcoin network with a market capitalization of 1.44 million BTC (~$135 million USD). It differs from other mainstream mining companies, including Butterfly Labs, Avalon and even new entrants like KnCMiner in that, rather than only selling devices, the company predominantly mines its own hardware and raised its startup capital by selling shares. The company first launched with an IPO on the now-defunct Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange (GLBSE) in August 2012, and shares sold out within hours. It then immediately set to work on developing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) specially designed for Bitcoin mining; although such chips will never be useful for anything but making SHA256 computations and as scrap metal, they would be ten to fifty times faster than anything else that was available at the time.The company’s first finished ASICs turned on in February, shortly after Avalon shipped their own, but quickly overtook Avalon due to shipping delays. The conjectures of the potential power of ASICs proved to be correct; the first Avalon device to make its way to a consumer paid for itself within nine days, and ASICMiner’s ASICs were similarly successful. A few months later, due to a combination of its success in manufacturing the devices and the sudden rise in the Bitcoin price, the company realized that it had far more money than it had anticipated, and would not have the space to mine all the devices that it could produce in house; thus, ASICMiner’s first actual products, the ASICMiner Block Erupter USB and ASICMiner Block Erupter Blade, were born.The company is also notable for having no online presence beyond a fewthreads on the Bitcointalkforum; it has been jokingly (although falsely) described as “the world’s first hundred-million dollar company without a website”. This was not much of a problem at first, as the Bitcoin investment community was essentially based on the Bitcointalk forum in 2012. Now, however, large numbers of people are interested in buying ASICMiner hardware but are turned off by the fact that the only way to by them at first was through forum-based auctions, and so the move to selling through a normal website, at least through third-party resellers, is very welcome.Those interested in buying ASICs should be careful to shop around for the best deals; ASICMiner’s Block Erupter USB, for example, provides 336 MH/s for 1 BTC – paying for itself in 250 days if network hashpower remains at the 150 TH/s level that it is today. More likely, network hashpower will be as high as 500 TH/s by September, so it is quite likely that buyers will not even recoup half of their costs. ASICMiner shares, offering 0.4-1 dividends per week, may be a better bet, as shares imply partial ownership of future ASICMiner technology as well. KnCMiner offers mining devices priced as low as 1 GH/s for $19, although they will not be shipping until at least September.Happy mining!",

    "text": "In the past year, travel has become a mainstay of the Bitcoin economy. There are currently dozens of hostels and hotels accepting Bitcoin around the world, even including a hostel in the middle of the Guatemalan rainforest. For those who do not like hotels, Airbnb alternative 9flats, a service that allows homeowners to easily rent out their rooms to short-term travellers, has been accepting bitcoins since April. Bitcoin ATMs let people buy bitcoins in person whenever they need, and bi-directional ATMs will soon allow people to travel the world with nothing but Bitcoin and cash out into whatever local currency they need upon arrival. An increasingly large number of Bitcoin conferences provide a reason for people to travel and come together from around the country – or even around the world. All that was left is a way of buying plane tickets for bitcoins. Now, Martin Fernandez has come up with : BTCTrip.Fernandez is, in many ways, the archetypal Bitcoin user. He had met original Linux developer Linus Torvalds and PGP creator Phil Zimmermann in the 1990s, and distinctly remembers Torvalds giving him a CD containing the first version of Slackware Linux in a meetup in 1998. “I was deep into this culture that all information had to be free,” Fernandez relates. He then proceeded to take up IT security as a career in 2004, and prospered for several years – until the 2007 economic crash hit. “It destroyed me completely,” Fernandez recalls. “I had to close my offices. I left the business scene for a couple of years completely, and I started to go into movies and use technology for the performing arts. [Several years later] I started teaching in Buenos Aires and working with technology again, and I was waiting for the one event that would drive me to come back. Then, I heard about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.”Excited about the project’s potential, Fernandez sent out emails to Phil Zimmermann and his other friends from the security community, and the responses he got were overwhelmingly positive. From there, Fernandez’s new career was set. All that was left was to figure out what it was that he could actually do for the Bitcoin community. Fernandez continues: “I called a designer friend, who is a crazy girl and makes flyers for electronics, and I said to her: Cassandra, design me a website for tickets, but we don’t want to just sell tickets, we want to sell the experience. Think of a programmer in Silicon Valley who just wants to take a break.” And so BTCTrip was born. The idea caught on quickly, with BitInstant founder Charlie Shrem becoming one of its earliest and loudest supporters, and many prominent Bitcoin users, including a number of Bitcoin Foundation members, quickly became BTCTrip customers.BTCTrip functions similarly to other plane ticket selling intermediaries, like Skyscanner and Expedia. Users enter the city they want to fly from and fly to, their desired departure date (and arrival date for return trips) and optionally their tolerance for discomforts like stopovers and long flights, and BTCTrip scans through all major providers to figure out what the cheapest options are. The user then selects one of the routes, and is directed to a form where they can fill in their name, date of birth and email address, and then pay for the order with bitcoins. Once BTCTrip processes the order, the user receives the flight confirmation by email, and can either check in online at the company’s website or wait to check in at the airport.Where BTCTrip truly shines, however, is in its prices. Most intermediary services that allow users to purchase products from the fiat currency economy with bitcoins by proxy work by charging a small percentage fee, so the services are actually more expensive than simply paying with one’s credit card directly. For this reason, most such services so far have seen little volume; their main customers are those whose primary income is in bitcoins, and so for whom it is converting from Bitcoin to fiat currency, rather than the other way around, that is the primary difficulty. BTCTrip, on the other hand, is often actually cheaper than its competition, charging buyers up to 5-10 less than what the ticket costs with a credit card. Most of the time intermediaries do this, it is either a marketing gimmick to attract more customers or a charity effort to support the Bitcoin community; not so with BTCTrip. Although Fernandez is unwilling to reveal the details of how his service does this, BTCTrip uses the bitcoins it receives from customers to provide liquidity for some kind of multi-currency arbitrage, exploiting inefficiencies in various Bitcoin and fiat currency exchange markets to earn a profit. “We are breaking even now,” Fernandez reports.In practice, not all flights are cheaper on BTCTrip; sometimes, Skyscanner and Expedia provide significantly better options, and in one deliberately pathological test case of flying from Iqaluit, Canada to Auckland, New Zealand, BTCTrip’s offer of 8,200 USD was roughly triple the 1,970 EUR (2,630 USD) given by Expedia – although, in that particular case, switching the departure date from Aug 24 to Aug 25 brought BTCTrip’s offer down to $2,470 compared to Expedia’s $2,640. However, for those cases where BTCTrip’s search engine simply can’t win, there is still a way out: at the top of the results window, the site features a banner making a offer popular with discount vendors: “Found it cheaper somewhere? We can beat any offer.” And it’s true; you need only click the “Buy Now” button, and fill in a form containing their name, email and a link to the better offer, and within hours BTCTrip will send you an email offering the better deal – with a 5 discount applied. BTCTrip’s customer service is excellent, politely, professionally and, perhaps most importantly, quickly responding to travellers’ concerns or special needs.Looking FurtherUltimately, BTCTrip’s mission extends far beyond simply offering flights for bitcoins; for Fernandez, the project is fundamentally about the community. The company does not purchase any advertising, relying entirely on word of mouth to get new customers, and places a heavy emphasis on public relations initiatives to support this strategy. BTCTrip has offered free tickets for Edward Snowden to use in Russia, and for free software advocate Richard Stallman to use in international travels. To support Bitcoin itself, Fernandez is actively trying to get Bitcoin accepted in Cuba, and BTCTrip frequently sells bitcoins to the Argentinian community, where most of the service’s employees are based. “These kinds of things are important to us,” Fernandez says. “Our business is based on community and trust in the community”The two core pillars of BTCTrip – selling not flights but experience, and integrating with the community, will continue to serve as the basis of the company as it expands. Recently, BTCTrip announced that it intends to launch three new services: Rent a Car and Hotel (self-explanatory), BTCTrip Miles and Points, a rewards program for regular customers, and BTCTrip Surfing, a program targeted toward travelers attending international events like concerts, raves, social forums, hacker and tech conferences and, of course, Bitcoin events. After that, Fernandez has another service in mind: Couchsurfing for Bitcoin users. Couchsurfing is a site where travellers can find local people to stay with for the duration of their journeys, avoiding the need to pay for expensive hotels. The two most popular alternatives, Airbnb and 9Flats are hybrids between Couchsurfing and traditional rental, allowing hosts to collect a daily or monthly fee, and 9Flats has accepted bitcoins since April. An equivalent that was Bitcoin-only would work specifically to bring together Bitcoin users, giving visitors not just a place to stay but also at least one person with a common interest to talk about. Between Bitcoin flights, Bitcoin hotels and couchsurfing, and an increasing number of local Bitcoin restaurants, the nomad Bitcoiner has everything that they need to survive – although more Bitcoin grocery stores would certainly help cut down food costs from eating at restaurants three times a day.Finally, BTCTrip might be planning a Bitcoin event of their own, to take place in Argentina. Argentina has seen a large growth in its local Bitcoin community because of the local government’s frequent economic mismanagement; the country last went bankrupt in 2001, and is currently experiencing inflation rates of around 30-50, depending on which exchange rate one believes. “Argentinians know very well about the problems of banks,” Fernandez explains, “and they don’t trust banks, even American banks.” Capital controls, high taxes, and a government that often wastes the tax money that it receives provider a further impetus for Bitcoin adoption. Finally, Fernandez explains, “Argentinians like new social and economic movements” in general. And the Argentinian Bitcoin economy is more than just talk; on Mercado Libre, a South America-focused equivalent of Craigslist, many people publish products and services for sale for bitcoins, and a significant number of Bitcoin trades actually take place. “I think interest in Bitcoin will increase and increase here,” Fernandez believes.Watch out for more updates from BTCTrip about the potential conference and their upcoming services in the months to come.",

    "text": "Today, ASICMiner, one of the three major developers of ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit)-based Bitcoin mining hardware, has announced that they have turned on their chips, and are outputting 1.7 TH/s of hashing power in a testing run. The event makes them the second company after Avalon to have working ASIC hardware, leaving the last remaining competitor, Butterfly Labs, behind. The 1.7 TH/s testing run represents only a small portion of the company’s full hashing power; ASICMiner has reported that their full first batch will have over 12 TH/s of hashing power, or slightly over half that shipped by Avalon, and intends to start the remaining batch running very soon; “the real update will be given in a few hours,” ASICMiner reports.ASICMiner differs from its two competitors in one key way: it is not actually selling any mining rigs to consumers. Rather, the company is keeping all of its hardware in house, and financed its development through 2012 by issuing company shares. The shares were originally released in August on the (now-defunct) Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange, opening up 7.5% of the company’s future profits to investors at a valuation of 40,000 BTC for the entire company. The offering was a success, selling out within days. The setup proved to be problematic when the GLBSE unexpectedly shut down, causing the company to lose contact with many of its investors, but the company finally received the shareholder database from the GLBSE in December, and shares will once again start trading and paying dividends on a yet-unspecified alternate platform soon.Network hash power is currently at around 25 TH/s, suggesting that many Avalon customers still have not received their rigs. Once most of Avalon’s customers turn their hardware on and ASICMiner starts hashing, network hash power is expected to increase to about 40-50 TH/s – with some old GPU miners dropping out because of the increased difficulty. February is proving to be a great month for Bitcoin miners so far; the sudden rise in price has allowed Jeff Garzik’s Avalon machine to pay for itself in nine days, and ensured that miners’ operating margins are now higher than they were before the mining reward drop in December. Butterfly Labs reports that their chips have been delivered to the bumping facility, suggesting that while they are not shipping just yet production is finally nearing completion; unfortunately, in a market where timing is everything, their customers will not be able to benefit from the same window of opportunity that Avalon and ASICMiner have. However, some Butterfly Labs consumers will be able to enjoy a 10-25% discount from their next purchase if they ordered early. Meanwhile, Avalon and ASICMiner are already working on second batches, with ASICMiner reporting that their next batch, which is “ordered and being produced in the fab already,” [will be 50 TH/s](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=99497.msg1529563#msg1529563). Although the ASIC mining market is unfolding much more slowly than many of us had predicted, it looks like the next two months will be the time that the new machines finally start to come online en masse.",

    "text": "Thane Richard of Outernet is chatting with me while in a coffee shop (on the anonymous peer-to-peer chat platform Talky). His car is being repaired at the mechanic next door—ah, the woes of the terrestrial world!Thane, what is Outernet?I think we should start by saying that there’s a pretty big problem—gap, disparity, whatever you want to call it—in the world right now, that not a lot of people are aware of. That’s that only about a third of humanity right now has access to the Internet. Four billion people cannot access the Internet, which is essentially an enormous library. The largest library ever built. And that library enables you to access so much valuable information that everyday, people like you and me take for granted. Whether it’s news, entertainment (entertainment is an end in itself, I think), health information, weather data for farmers, courseware. What Outernet does is we broadcast the best of the content of this library, from space, for free.And so anyone within our broadcast footprint, which right now is limited to North America, Europe, Middle East, and North Africa—anybody can build a receiver, which we publish plans to—openly—no one ever has to buy anything from Outernet. In fact, we encourage people to build their own receivers, and we hope that, sort of like FM radio, we can focus on the signal and allow others to manufacture the actual radios that tune in to the signal.And everything that it is in the library, or in the broadcast, is selected and open for vote. So people can request. We just actually released this last week. It’s called WhiteBoard. You can go and paste a link—we ask that you tell us what the license for the content is—and then people can vote on it. It sort of moves up and down the queue based on demand. So, that is Outernet.Excellent. With the system of voting, is that because you have only so many megabytes to broadcast per day, so the content must be prioritized?Right. Right now we’re broadcasting 200 megabytes per day to those locations I mentioned. It’s like BitTorrent from space.How could Outernet help in, say, a zombie apocalypse, in which a lack of electricity limits connection to the Internet?[Laughs.] I’m a huge Walking Dead fan, too. Or I used to be at the beginning. I feel like the show’s kind of fallen off.In the event of a zombie apocalypse—what you always see in the classic zombie movies—is all these little groups working in isolation. Everybody just sort of forms these camps, nobody has any idea what’s going on, the plots are always centered around getting to the “safe zone” but no one knows if it’s been built. It’s almost like we go from the two-thirds of humanity who don’t have access to this library, to everyone. In that situation, Outernet would be the oasis in the desert. We would continue to broadcast, because whatever is happening on earth, whether it’s a zombie apocalypse or tsunami or military conflict, has no effect on our ability to broadcast from space. We’d probably prioritize news, emergency information, how to best prepare and defend yourself from the zombie apocalypse—maybe that book by, who’s the guy who wrote World War Z? His first book about the zombie preparedness guide. Anyway, maybe we’d broadcast that book and a few classic zombie movies so that people can see what works and doesn’t work.I should clarify—Outernet is not the Internet. It’s not two-way communication. With Outernet, it’s a one-way broadcast. You receive what we broadcast, and you can filter it.What would it take for Outernet to become a two-way communication system?More funding. [Laughs.] If we had an unlimited, deep purse, we’d be able to switch on to two-way communication, but there are actually a few reasons why that’s not ideal, and why there should be a one-way broadcast, sort of as a baseline that is always available, and having a two-way broadcast as more of a premium service.The first is that, when you have a two-way broadcast, you have transmitters, because now you’re not just having an antenna or a dish or a receiver that is purely a receive-only device, which is what you have with, like, an FM radio. Your FM radio can’t talk back to the radio station, so it’s not as heavily regulated. Whenever you start broadcasting information from a device, you’re going to run into enormous hurdles in terms of telecommunication regulation, pretty much in every country. So we’re able to mostly avoid that.The second is that, because it’s a one-way data stream, it guarantees the end user anonymity of consumption. When you turn on your radio in your car, nobody knows you turned it on and nobody knows what you’re listening to. So same thing with Outernet. Nobody is able to know—we’re not even able to know—how many people have built a receiver, whether it’s on, what they have on it and what they’re reading. So for those who are very concerned with privacy, especially with all the revelations with what the U.S. government has been doing with the NSA, tracking Internet users’ online behavior, that’s not something we’d be able to give access to even if we wanted to. That sort of shield of anonymity is very important.Do you yet take donations in Bitcoin?We do! We have been accepting bitcoins for a little while.How else can people get involved?There are actually several ways. The first, as you mentioned, is to donate and support our work financially, which we always appreciate. Short of donating, the biggest help would be signing our list. Adding your name and email to our list is casting your vote in support of a world without censorship and with free information access for everyone, regardless of income or geography. It helps us build credibility, raisefunds, and deliver on our mission. The last way is really pretty basic—just support what we’re doing by adding to the discussion. Go in our forums, talk about what you think about Outernet, why you think it’s important, whether you disagree with it. Some people disagree with it, and think we’re a total conspiracy. They think we’re like SkyNet [laughs].We just released a video that we think is pretty powerful, about this idea of a world without censorship—what would this world look like if everybody had access to this information? So that is a huge help when people share that video. The more people around the world who know that Outernet exists, the better.Outernet’s Bitcoin donation address is 12BvyAn2wYHzgCKcJvKfapKgo9G7anEcSX. They are currently holding a crowdfundraiser to make the Outernet broadcast completely global.",

    "title": "Altcoins, or alternative cryptocurrencies such as ,Primecoin and Dogecoin, have always been a popular and controversial topic in the Bitcoin",
    "text": "Altcoins, or alternative cryptocurrencies such as ,Primecoin and Dogecoin, have always been a popular and controversial topic in the Bitcoin space. The purpose of most of these currencies is to offer small modifications from Bitcoin proper, including faster confirmation times, attempts at socially useful mining algorithms and different monetary policies such as fast exponential decay, quadratic decay and even infinitely linearly growing supply, and investors and users of the coins believe that these additional features and modifications will make the currencies either overtake Bitcoin or at least survive in some niche. Detractors, on the other hand, argue that Bitcoin’s network effect is too large, and altcoins do not provide nearly sufficient value over Bitcoin to ever take over to any significant extent.Daniel Krawisz from The Mises Circle has taken the lead in the anti-altcoin faction, with two lengthy articles written on the subject in the last few months. The first article, The Problem With Altcoins, introduced the issue of network effects, the property of interaction protocols such as social networks, file formats, currencies and languages to become intrinsically more valuable the more users they have, as an argument for why one currency succeeding is the only stable state, and used various arguments to attack individual altcoins. I later wrote a response, and Krawisz’ second article, The Coming Demise of the Altcoins, was in part a response to my response, expanding on his reasoning as to the exact nature of the network effect that he was describing.The key parts of Krawisz’ argument are as follows:The market cap of a currency should be seen as roughly proportional, all things being equal, to a currency’s liquidity, which refers to the value that can be bought or sold without significantly altering the price. While it is theoretically possible for a currency of a given market cap to support any volume of trade as a medium of exchange, this requires that people become less and less willing to hold the currency for any length of time as the volume of trade increases. In this situation, severe practical difficulties ultimately develop. For example, if someone wanted to buy something worth more than the entire market cap of the currency he was using, he would have to pay with several transactions.And, on why this is important:Consider the hypothetical example of an economy that uses exactly two currencies, Acoin and Bcoin, which are equally preferred by holders. For whatever reason, Acoin develops a very slight advantage over Bcoin. Consequently a few people exchange Bcoin for Acoin, thus very slightly increasing the market cap and liquidity of Acoin and slightly decreasing that of Bcoin.Now, in addition to its initial slight advantage over Bcoin, Acoin has the advantage of becoming more liquid. As a result, more people will tend to sell Bcoin for Acoin. Thus, Acoin’s initial advantage is self-reinforcing, and as the disparity between Acoin and Bcoin increases, its superiority becomes more and more evident.Eventually, Krawisz writes, this positive feedback loop would lead to exactly one coin succeeding. This is not the network effects argument that most people would expect with regard to currencies; the standard argument, and one that I had originally incorrectly inferred that Krawisz had in mind, is the network effect of merchant adoption: a currency is more useful if more merchants accept it, and merchants want to accept a currency that many customers use. This standard argument I refuted in my earlier piece, arguing that it is much easier for a merchant to simultaneously accept multiple cryptocurrencies than it is to accept both bitcoin and dollars, and so switching costs are small and therefore network effects are small. Rather, Krawisz is arguing for a different kind of network effect: the effect of liquidity, the precise argument behind which he outlined in the paragraphs quoted above.Breadth and DepthIn finance, there are actually two definitions of liquidity, and it is not always clear which definition someone talking about liquidity is referring to. The first definition, and the one more often used in mainstream finance, has to do with market depth; the question is, how much of an asset can be sold on a market without affecting the price by more than some specified amount? For example, in the current Bitstamp order book, you can sell $100000 without bringing the price down by more than 1, and you can sell $500000 without bringing the price down by more than 2. On BTC-E’s LTC/BTC order book, on the other hand, you can go down 1 with $16000 and 1.5 takes $36000; the LTC/USD has a similar amount.The second definition, however, and arguably the one that is much more useful to the average user, refers to the spread: what is the percentage that you lose when trading LTC for BTC or USD? This is what people mean when they say that currency is liquid, whereas a house is illiquid: the effort of buying or selling a house takes up a substantial portion of the amount that you are going to receive. In both Bitcoin and Litecoin, this measure of liquidity is made up of the bid/ask spread on the exchange (the difference between the lowest sell order and the highest buy order) and the transaction fee; in total, this amount is almost always less than one percent, and because exchange fees dominate there is actually not much difference between BTC and other altcoins.Of course, the assertion that narrow spread is more important to average users than the ability to sell large quantities needs to be defended. In general, most purchases made with currency are very small; Overstock reports an average of $226 for Bitcoi customers, an average credit card transaction is $88 and the Android and iOS app markets show $14. On the employment market, on the other hand, transactions go up to the low thousands apiece. But in any case, it seems clear at least at first glance that most people fall far below the point at which the “depth” kind of liquidity even matters, especially once the much larger and more stable non-financial liquidity in the form of products for sale and workers for hire comes into play.A more sophisticated, and audacious, reply may point out that the point of currencies is not to purchase goods and services; it’s to speculate on them. This argument may seem absurd at first glance, but Daniel Krawisz actually makes it, and so it must be responded to. In this case, it’s not the size of a single consumer transaction that matters when it comes to liquidity, but rather the total sum of an individual’s wealth. A currency is then sufficiently liquid if, in most cases, most individuals can liquidate their entire holdings, presumably to speculate on the next currency to come along, without taking too big a hit on the spread. In these circumstances, the weaker depth of altcoins does start to become an issue.However, the idea that the primary utility of a currency is for moving one’s entire savings from one currency to another certainly needs to be questioned. In the current world, the main purpose of altcoins is indeed to speculate on them, but arguably that is only because cryptocurrencies have not yet found their intrinsic value and are largely treated as investment vehicles in comparison to the dollar. If cryptocurrencies do take on a much larger role, however, the point that BTC is more liquid will become moot. If BTC is the dominant currency, it will be the most liquid currency. But liquid against what? Altcoins? If so, it seems like altcoins do need to exist after all. Products? In that case, as we discussed, depth-liquidity really is not that much of an issue.Smartcoins and Feature CoinsThe category of altcoins that Krawisz describes in more detail is what can be described (in my words) as “feature coins” and “smartcoins” – essentially, currencies with either extra features on top or entire frameworks that allow users to write applications inside of them, categories that have also been described as cryptocurrency 2.0. Krawisz argues that the advantages of these platforms are also insufficient to defeat Bitcoin’s depth-liquidity advantage. Krawisz writes:When people say, “But Ethereum can do smart contracts!” this is actually false. It is only the Ethereum protocol plus liquidity that make smart contracts possible. If Ethereum were not liquid, it would be impossible to build any real penalties into a contract because it would be impossible to tie a sufficient value into them. Since there is no logical reason to expect Ethereum ever to be liquid, there is no logical reason to expect that many people will be able to create smart contracts with it.The problem with this argument is obvious: once again, you really don’t need that much depth-liquidity for the platform to be useful for ordinary people, and spread-liquidity has proven to be a trivial problem in any case (and, in Mastercoin and Ethereum’s case, will be even more trivial because of the possibility of decentralized exchange contracts reducing exchange fees to literally zero). If MSC, or ether, can have a depth-liquidity of even $5000 for 1, then its smart contract functionality will work just fine for transactions under that size. If you assume that the smart contract functionality of these transaction media is powerful enough to be worth a 1 fee, then you can see how the platforms can be useful under that size. And even over that size, some merchants may want to accept MSC/ETH as currencies directly. And once enough people are using them, their depth-liquidity can go up, progressively tolerating higher and higher levels of maximum value.Another reason behind the success of altcoins is the issue of anti-network effects: in some ways cryptocurrencies become less useful the more people use them. The main reason behind this is currently technical – a single blockchain gets bulkier the more people use it, and it becomes more cumbersome to download and use the client. Theoretically, this can be handled via scalability solutions such as light clients, verifier-based challenge-response protocols, Merkle mountain ranges and SCIP, but it exists for the moment. As a result, different currencies have different informal policies on what kind of transactions they want to accept; in the case of Bitcoin, for example, developers have proven very hostile to data inclusion and meta-protocols, whereas Datacoin is specifically designed for storing data. Dogecoin has vastly lower transaction fees than Bitcoin, making it ideal for small-value microtransactions. In the long term, of course, this will not last, since scalability technologies will make it more valuable to coalesce everything on one blockchain, but in the short term it is a valid reason why altcoins exist.A more important argument, however, comes in the form of what Dmytri Kleiner calls the public function of money – the idea that money has a function beyond just its ability to facilitate transaction. This second function has to do with the concept of “seignorage” – when you create a new currency, you also need to issue new units of that currency, and those new units would need to be allocated in some fashion. As people start using the currency for trade and as a store of value, the value of those units increases from zero to nonzero, providing the initial recipients of that currency with a sort of “phantom” return that was not paid by anyone. This creates a powerful, decentralized, solution to the public goods problem: instead of expecting individuals to contribute money to useful projects where only a millionth share of the utility will go to themselves, we can fund said projects via emergent value created out of nowhere. Bitcoin uses this emergent value purely to fund network security; Primecoin tries to simultaneously fund network security and scientific computation, although its implementation is unfortunately a relatively weak one.One of the main attractions of cryptocurrency 2.0 is the idea of “appcoins” – protocols with a currency or token system built in, where the token system generates the emergent value to fund the development of the protocol. Having every protocol add its own currency for funding purposes may seem ugly, but the quantity of potential monetization per unit ugliness is vastly higher than existing solutions, such as making a protocol that is proprietary, charging license fees and excluding users who cannot afford to pay, and releasing “crippleware” apps in order to facilitate monetization or advertising. In the future, using emergent network assets (including non-fungible assets such as namespaces) as a funding mechanism may become the dominant business model for decentralized applications. If Bitcoin was the only game in town, none of this would be possible.This idea goes beyond just appcoins: this emergent network value from a currency can also be used to support communities, either by providing a limited “citizen’s dividend” program (eg. Auroracoin) or supporting other public goods that have nothing to do with cryptocurrency specifically. The concept of “branded coins” has become popular, particularly in the space of funding musicians and artists, and currencies based around “useful” activities, such as Curecoin, are becoming increasingly popular. Cryptocurrencies with a socially useful public function will benefit from superior community support and marketing, ensuring success at least among the community of people who care about the specific objectives that each individual “coin” supports.In conclusion, the arguments in favor of altcoins can be summed up as follows. First, some altcoins do have substantial benefits over Bitcoin, with particular emphasis on cryptocurrency 2.0 platforms that offer smart contracts, the ability to issue custom assets, decentralized exchange, etc. Second, even without such benefits, there is a reason to have alternative currencies right now, which can basically be summed up as “lower transaction fees”. Third, currencies in general have a crucially important “public function”, and Bitcoin is very unimaginative in its attempt to exploit this possibility, using it solely to fund an arguably excessive amount of network security. Decentralized applications have the potential to use internal currencies and assets to fund themselves, and currencies can be used to fund external public goods as well.Finally, out of the the main arguments of network effects, merchant adoption, spread-liquidity and depth-liquidity, the first is a non-issue because switching between altcoins is very easy, the second is a non-issue because exchange fees dominate spreads in any case, and the third is a non-issue because most ordinary users fall under the thresholds. In the future, I expect to see a power-law distribution in the crypto-asset space: a few large platforms, like Bitcoin, where the bulk of mainstream activity can take place, a larger number of platforms with coins built in of varying size, and a very large number of small altcoins whose main attraction is a specialized community. Let a million currencies bloom.",

    "text": "Bitcoin is more than a currency and more than a protocol. It’s an idea. In order to spread, ideas need a communicator. They need a representative. In short, they need a face.Bitcoin has found that face in Bitcoin Girl, the always-effervescent Naomi Brockwell. Born and raised in Australia, Brockwell leverages her intrigue and charm to craft educational, informative videos about all things crypto-currency. Degrees in acting, classical music, and musical theatre, combined with a lifelong passion for economics, have prepared her to take on the role as an unofficial spokesperson for a revolutionary technology.In addition to Bitcoin Girl, Brockwell is a policy associate at the New York Bitcoin Center, a member of the advisory council of the Mannkal Economic Education Foundation, a program officer at the Moving Picture Institute, and CEO & founder of Rainsworth Productions. Her feature film Subconsciousis currently in post-production.Naomi and I recently had a delightful conversation about bitcoin, art, and freedom.Joseph S. Diedrich:When and why did you come to the United States?Naomi Brockwell:I came to the United States about 3½ years ago to study opera just for a couple of months. But as soon as I realized what there was for me in New York, it became very clear that I couldn’t go back without making the most of all the opportunities. Since then, my focus has shifted to film, simply because of the opportunities that have presented themselves.JSD:How would you compare Australians’ perspective on bitcoin with that of Americans?NB:I go back to Australia twice a year. As far as I can see, bitcoin nodes are a good reflection of how well bitcoin is or isn’t integrated into society. In the entirety of western Australia, there’s one node. That’s in stark contrast to New York. I can basically live within the bitcoin world here. I can buy my groceries with bitcoin. I can buy dresses with bitcoin. I can pay my lawyer with bitcoin.I definitely see a big future for bitcoin in Australia. Australians have a very individualistic mindset. We’re always looking for avenues that are outside of the government sphere and outside of corporate interests. I think the difference in adoption right now is an educational issue.JSD:Do you recall how you first became aware of bitcoin?NB:Yes. I was at an economics conference about two years ago. A friend of mine had a Casascius coin, which is a physical bitcoin. I had heard the buzzword before simply because of the circles I was involved in, but I had never had taken the time to really understand it. My friend explained to me what bitcoin was in detail.It was and is exciting for me to see this new potential open up before my eyes. We’ve had a government monopoly on currency for a really long time. Suddenly, we have a competitive currency. We have a digital currency that’s keeping up with the digital age and a global currency that’s keeping up with our global economy. Our currency finally seems to be in line with where we’re at technologically.It worries me that there are attempts to integrate bitcoin into the existing financial system. If it were up to me, I’d say we should allow bitcoin to reinvent the framework. I’d like to see what blossoms if we were to just let it be.JSD:What do you think the most important event in the history of bitcoin has been so far?NB:The bitcoin world moves so incredibly fast. I just got back from the Toronto Bitcoin Conference. One of the founders ofethereum was talking about some aspects that they weren’t unrolling for a really long time…you know, six months. To them, that’s a really long time. This technology evolves so quickly. It’s exciting to think about what the bitcoin landscape, the economic landscape, will look like in ten or twenty years from now.JSD:Over those next ten or twenty years, what do think the biggest challenge facing bitcoin is?NB: Like with anything new, you’re going to have a lot of people trying to guard the past. New things are scary to people, and when you don’t understand something, that’s especially frightening. I think the biggest challenge is going to be overcoming the demonization of bitcoin, which the mainstream media and government have been perpetuating. We need to teach people what bitcoin actually is. It could be a vehicle for peace. It could be a vehicle for elevating people out of poverty. It could address many social problems. If people realize this, then we’re going to see widespread adoption.JSD:How can bitcoin empower artists?NB:Bitcoin can change an artist’s process of monetizing what they do. Microtransactions play a huge part in that. iTunes recognized a market and said let’s allow people to download music and pay per song. People want to buy in smaller quantities, so let’s enable them with a really secure method. That’s when you saw music piracy really go down. At the moment, you also have digital subscriptions to newspapers. You might only read the newspaper once a week, but you’re still paying for the entire subscription. I think what we’re going to start seeing more and more of is the ability to pay per article, especially in bitcoin. We’ll also see donations for free content as a way of showing appreciation for the work of writers, authors, musicians, and filmmakers. We’re going to see more of that now because we finally have an affordable method of transferring value.The Moving Picture Institute is very interested in bitcoin. They see its potential for lifting people out of poverty and as being a tool for freedom of speech. They’re also interested in the technology and its ability to regulate itself. Working for MPI combines two of my loves—film and monetary policy.JSD:How long have monetary policy and economics been on your mind?NB:I’ve always been very interested in individual rights and freedom, and I actually started out studying economics. The passion was really sparked, however, when I moved to New York—the financial capital of the world. I became surrounded by brilliant minds who opened my eyes. Economics is the foundation of society and the fabric of civilization.JSD:What made you decide to become Bitcoin Girl?NB:I was heavily involved in bitcoin. I became Policy Associate at the Bitcoin Center when it first opened. I had been trading in the futures market for a while. There were huge changes happening. They were really starting to look into the holes in the Mt. Gox system. There were a lot of things going on that people weren’t talking about except on written forums.I recognized that educating people about bitcoin is so important, but the avenues that were used to discuss bitcoin were all very esoteric. Reddit isn’t accessible to a lot of people. We needed a voice for bitcoin that was accessible to more people. Using video for educating people was and is necessary to combat the vilification and demonization of crypto-currency. Bitcoin needs physical voices and faces. That’s why I’m so excited about some of the bitcoin-related projects I’m working on with the Moving Picture Institute. They really recognise the power of film in educating people about important issues (thempi.org).JSD:What do you hope to accomplish as Bitcoin Girl?NB:Film is an incredible medium for communicating with people. I can use it to help people understand something I think is really important. That’s what I hope to achieve.JSD:One last question. What can the average person do in their everyday life to further the cause of liberty and freedom?NB:I think that having strong principles, a lot of integrity, and fighting for what you believe in is the most important thing that you can do. Stand by your convictions. Be open-minded enough to hear other people’s side of things. Don’t be a fence-sitter. Become educated about things. Realize that if you don’t fight for people who don’t have a voice, then it’s the same as persecuting them yourself.",

    "text": "Bitcoin Magazine would like to congratulate former Lead Writer and now Editorial Board Member, Vitalik Buterin, on his receipt of the Peter Thiel Fellowship Award. Vitalik is the mastermind behind the Ethereum Project. As a 20 year old, his development experience is extensive with involvement in Bitcoin, KryptoKit, and the Dark Wallet.Through the Peter Thiel Fellowship program, Vitalik will receive a grant of $100k to span over two years so he can focus full time on the Ethereum project and further decentralized developments. In addition to funding, all fellows will receive guidance on entrepreneurship and startups.Congratulations, Vitalik!The Thiel Foundation issued the following press release on the award and recipients:PETER THIEL ANNOUNCES 2014 CLASS OF THIEL FELLOWSWIRED.com video series “Teen Technorati” follows 40 finalists vying for a Thiel FellowshipSAN FRANCISCO – June 2, 2014 – Peter Thiel today introduced the 2014 class of new Thiel Fellows. The fourth set of young entrepreneurs to be awarded Thiel Fellowships, the fellows will receive support to bring their innovative scientific and technical projects to life, learn entrepreneurship from the ground up, and begin to build the companies of tomorrow.“As student debt soars and the wages of college graduates sag, the need for more thoughtful and personalized approaches to finding success is greater than ever,” said Peter Thiel, creator of the Thiel Fellowship. “We hope the 2014 Thiel Fellows inspire people of all ages as they demonstrate that intellectual curiosity, grit, and determination are more important than credentials for improving civilization.”Over two years, each fellow receives $100,000 from the Thiel Foundation as well as mentorship from the Foundation’s network of tech entrepreneurs, investors, scientists, thought leaders, futurists, and innovators. Projects pursued by the 2014 class of fellows span numerous cutting-edge science and technology fields, including aerospace, computer science, education, game development, biotechnology, health I.T., neuroprosthetics, and civic technology. At a time of increasing concern over the value of a college education and a national student debt burden that tops $1 trillion, the Thiel Fellows are part of a growing national movement exploring alternative ways to build successful futures.For the 2014 fellowship, the Thiel Foundation received applications from nearly every state in the U.S. and from 44 different countries. The applications represented a diverse pool of educational experiences, coming from young people in high schools, undergraduate and graduate schools, state schools, technical schools and liberal arts colleges, homeschooled students, and some who had already stopped out of college.“As we welcome the new class into the growing Thiel Fellowship community, we also celebrate the achievements of our 2011, 2012, and 2013 fellows,” said Jonathan Cain, president of the Thiel Foundation. “Over the past three years, they have started dozens of companies, created more than 182 jobs, and generated more than $87 million in economic activity. They’ve acquired this funding by raising venture capital, earning grants and sponsorships, shipping products, generating revenue, and even by selling the companies they’ve created. And now they are helping the next generation of tech researchers and entrepreneurs by mentoring future cohorts of Thiel fellows.”The Fellowship application process is known for its challenging and unconventional nature, and the journey of this year’s 40 top finalists was documented by WIRED’s new mini-series “Teen Technorati.” Season one of the series, available online now on YouTube and at http://video.wired.com/series/teen-technorati, captures every step of the competition during the finalist weekend in San Francisco as the young finalists vie for the fellowship.“Selecting twenty Thiel Fellows from the pool of finalists was particularly difficult this year,” said Mike Gibson, VP of Grants for the Thiel Foundation. “The WIRED crew really captured the incredible talent and sheer determination that all of the candidates brought to the weekend activities, including team building challenges, their individual lightning round pitches, and café-style mentor interviews. Even more importantly, though, the finalists were able to come together as a community of new friends and colleagues, which we hope will continue for the rest of their lives.”Although competition for the fellowship is strong, there are numerous opportunities for interested young people to participate in the community. The Thiel Foundation Summit, a semi-annual conference sponsored by the Thiel Foundation is open to young people who are passionate about entrepreneurship and technology. The most recent summit, in New York City last November, drew more than 450 attendees from around the world. The next summit will take place in San Francisco on June 7 and 8. Attendance is by invitation only; to learn more or request an invitation please visit: http://www.thielfoundationsummit.org“With the Thiel Summits we aim to continue to encourage more young people to focus on technology and entrepreneurship, and empowering them to pursue their dreams,” said Danielle Strachman, program director of the Thiel Fellowship. “These weekend-long conferences bring together fellowship applicants, current fellows, mentors, and hundreds of young people who are excited about entrepreneurship. Most exciting for us, summit attendees have started forming grassroots meetup groups when they return home, helping grow the spirit of our community exponentially.”ABOUT THE 2014 THIEL FELLOWS:Shantanu Bala (19, Phoenix, AZ) is developing a system for using a real-time video and audio feed to convey visual facial expressions and auditory cues using a series of vibrations across a user’s skin.

    "text": "Written By: Christopher Rajotte, Andrew Ittleman, and Mitchell Fuerst, Fuerst Ittleman David & Joseph, PL, Miami, FloridaFrom the recent collapse of the major bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, to the alleged identification of Bitcoin’s creator in California, the prominence of bitcoin in the public consciousness seems to escalate by the day. The public’s focus on bitcoin at this time of year is especially appropriate given that it is tax season. The use of bitcoin in the marketplace raises a host of tax issues and many bitcoin users are searching for answers as to how to treat and report their bitcoin income or transactions. This article is meant to serve as a primer on the key tax issues raised by bitcoin use and how those issues should be analyzed under existing tax laws.I. The IRS’s Position and the Public’s AwarenessOn March 25, 2014, the IRS issued Notice 2014-21, which “describes how existing tax principles apply to transactions using virtual currency.” Before relying too extensively on the information provided in this Notice, it is important for taxpayers to be aware of the authoritative weight given to such Notices by the IRS and the Federal courts.Notices such as Notice 2014-21 are public pronouncements on matters of general public interest that permit the IRS to state a position without undergoing the time-intensive procedures necessary to issue a Revenue Ruling or promulgate Treasury regulations. While the IRS will generally respect the position it sets forth in Notices, thus allowing taxpayers to rely on Notices during a controversy with the IRS at the administrative level, IRS Notices do not have the force and effect of law and do not bind courts. Moreover, while courts are generally inclined to give some authoritative weight to IRS Notices, due to the haste in which they are issued, the weight and deference courts afford to IRS Notices is generally lower than other IRS pronouncements, such as Revenue Rulings. Additionally, within the overall tax landscape, the issues addressed by Notice 2014-21 are narrow. The bottom line is that taxpayers should review Notice 2014-21 and use it to inform their decisions when reporting bitcoin transactions and income, but should also be aware that the Notice is neither the sole nor final authority regarding the taxation of bitcoin. Federal tax law as applied to bitcoin or any other asset is complex and wide-ranging; Notice 2014-21 touches on a very small part of it.II. What is Bitcoin?Before the tax implications of bitcoin can be analyzed, it is necessary to first briefly explain what bitcoin is and how it is used. Bitcoin is a decentralized virtual store of value that is beginning to gain greater and greater acceptance as a medium of exchange in the mainstream marketplace. Notice 2014-21 describes virtual currencies, such as bitcoin, as:[A] digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value…Virtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as a substitute for real currency, is referred to as “convertible” virtual currency…Bitcoin derives value not from governmental backing or a link to an underlying commodity, but purely from its finite nature, the effort required to generate new bitcoin, and the value its users place on it and its acceptance as a medium of exchange in certain segments of the market. The trading value of one bitcoin has undergone significant fluctuations recently. For instance, between October 2013 and December 2013 the value of one bitcoin increased by over 1,000 dollars. Through mid to late March 2014, the value of one bitcoin remained close to 600 dollars.Bitcoin allows its users to hold a medium of exchange without the need to rely on the banking system or other regulated transaction channels. Bitcoin is transferred, digitally, from one owner to another. The key to bitcoin is its construction as a cryptocurrency. This means that one must be in possession of certain key codes in order to access bitcoin. When a sender (such as a buyer using bitcoin to make a purchase) intends to transmit bitcoin to a receiver (such as a seller accepting bitcoin as payment), the sender sends a “public key” to assign to the receiver his ownership rights. The sender also certifies the transaction by signing with his “private key.” Third-parties, by reference to a public registry called the “block-chain,” can verify that the sender sent his public key to the recipient and certified the transaction by signing with his private key. The block-chain prevents manipulation of bitcoin ownership and double-spending is prevented by maintenance of a public registry that records transactions and current ownership interests. It records all bitcoin transactions, keeping track of such vital information as the counterparties to each transaction and the date of each transaction.Reconciliation of bitcoin transactions is also part of what creates new bitcoin. More specifically, certain computer users provide computing power to record and reconcile bitcoin transactions, and to provide status updates regarding bitcoin ownership. Verifying and reconciling transactions, however, can only be completed by solving complex mathematical problems. This process is called “mining.” As incentive to engage in the mining process, miners receive new bitcoins as a result of their mining activities. Bitcoin supply is finite (the maximum number of bitcoin that will ever exist is approximately 21 million), and the amount that can be mined at any one time is also limited: as the amount of bitcoins that can exist approaches its limits, the amount that miners receive decreases.Transacting with others in bitcoin requires ownership of a “bitcoin wallet.” Bitcoin wallets can be installed on a computer like software, can be made mobile for use on a mobile phone, can be web wallets, accessible via the internet, or can be held in “cold storage,” which means they are offline and the requisite key codes are recorded only on paper. The purpose of a bitcoin wallet is to save bitcoin addresses (the public and private codes explained above)—the information needed to transfer bitcoins. There is no restriction on the number of bitcoin wallets someone may utilize.A good summary of fundamental questions and answers surrounding bitcoin can be found here.III. How Will Bitcoin Be Taxed?Although it is unclear precisely how the IRS will treat and characterize each of the countless varieties of bitcoin income or transactions, it is clear that all transactions using bitcoin, and the disposition of bitcoin, have federal tax consequences. Indeed, the federal tax questions raised by use of bitcoin are almost too many to count. For instance, assume A holds bitcoin worth 1,000 dollars, and “cashes it in” for 1,000 dollars of US currency. Assuming A purchased the bitcoin when its value was lower, say 500 dollars, does A have to recognize 500 dollars in gain, as he would with most dispositions property? If so, what character does his gain take? Similarly, assume A holds bitcoin worth 1,000 dollars, and exchanges his bitcoin for 1,000 dollars’ worth of services. Is this a taxable event?What if Employer pays Employee in bitcoin in exchange for Employee’s services? Is this exchange properly characterized as wages subject to employment tax withholding?Further, assume a bitcoin holder has more than $10,000 worth of bitcoin in his virtual wallet, the server on which the record of bitcoin ownership is stored is located outside the United States. Is the bitcoin holder required to make a disclosure under the Foreign Bank Account Reporting requirement of the Bank Secrecy Act?While some of these issues have been addressed by Notice 2014-21, a vast majority of tax issues raised by bitcoin use remain unresolved. Assuming, as seems likely, that bitcoin’s prominence in the marketplace continues to grow, these unresolved questions will have to be confronted by the IRS and the federal courts. Until then, taxpayers are encouraged to make prudent and educated judgments with the assistance of experienced tax professionals as to how to report their bitcoin transactions to the tax authorities.IV. Classifying Bitcoin for Tax PurposesPrior to the issuance of Notice 2014-21, the key questions surrounding the taxation of bitcoin revolved around its classification as a currency or property, and, if it were classified as property, whether gains derived from bitcoin will be capital or ordinary in character. Notice 2014-21 makes clear that for tax purposes, bitcoin will be treated as property. Below we explain some of the primary ramifications of this treatment.a. Why is Bitcoin Not a Currency?First, it is important to explain why the IRS will treat bitcoin as property, rather than currency, as this question has been looming over the bitcoin community for years. Under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC or Code), currency is broken down into “functional” and “non-functional” currency. For most purposes, functional currency refers only to the US dollar. It is extremely unlikely that the definition of functional currency under the IRC would be expanded to include bitcoin or any store of value other than dollar.For that reason, if Bitcoin were classified as a currency, it would more specifically be classified as a non-functional currency. If bitcoin were considered a non-functional currency, exchanges of bitcoin for US dollars would be treated as an exchange of a foreign currency for US dollars and would result in the recognition of ordinary income, to the extent of any gain, under IRC § 988. A general application of ordinary income treatment to bitcoin transactions was a significant worry of bitcoin users prior to the IRS’s clarification of bitcoin’s tax classification.However, because bitcoin does not bear the traditional indicia of currency, it always seemed unlikely that the IRS would treat bitcoin as a currency. Bitcoin is not backed or issued by a central government and is not linked to another asset such as gold or silver. Moreover, Bank Secrecy Act regulations (not binding for purposes of the IRC) define “currency” as “the coin and currency of the United States or of any other country, which circulate in and are customarily used and accepted as money in the country in which issued.” 31 CFR § 1010.100(m). Due to bitcoin’s current lack of widespread circulation and its lack of customary acceptance as a money equivalent in the US and other countries, and drawing on the Bank Secrecy Act definition of currency, it seemed apparent even prior to the issuance of Notice 2014-21 that the IRS was unlikely to classify bitcoin as a currency, an assumption confirmed by Notice 2014-21. See Notice 2014-21 at Q-1 and Q-2.Different countries have taken different positions regarding bitcoin’s status as a currency. For instance, last year Germany did not go so far to recognize bitcoin as an official currency, but it did recognize bitcoin as a “unit of account,” opening it for use in the wider marketplace and creating a framework by which to tax bitcoin-based transactions. Conversely, Japan has refused to recognize bitcoin as a currency or anything similar. China has also refused to recognize bitcoin as a currency, and has instead defined it as a virtual commodity. China has gone so far as to ban its banks and payment institutions from dealing in bitcoin. A summary of the treatment of bitcoin in selected jurisdictions prepared by the Global Research Center of the Law Library of Congress can be found here.b. Treatment of Bitcoin as PropertyFollowing the issuance of Notice 2014-21 and confirmation that bitcoin will be treated as property rather than currency, the primary practical question that arises is whether the IRS will classify bitcoin as a capital or non-capital asset. This determination is important because dispositions of capital assets held by a taxpayer for a year or more are generally subject to lower rates of taxation than dispositions of non-capital assets. Less favorable for US taxpayers, however, is that long-term capital losses generally cannot be used to offset ordinary income (the income that most people earn, such as wages or investment interest).Capital assets are defined under the Code by what they are not. In defining capital assets, the IRC starts with the simple premise that a capital asset is “property held by the taxpayer (whether or not connected with his trade or business).” IRC § 1221. Thus, the default classification for property is as a capital asset. From there, the IRC excludes eight specific types of assets that are not capital: inventory, real or depreciable property held for use in the taxpayer’s trade or business, intellectual property created through the taxpayer’s personal efforts, accounts receivable, government documents, certain dealer-held derivative financial instruments, hedging transactions, and non-inventory supplies regularly used or consumed by the taxpayer in his trade or business. The definition of capital asset makes clear that the determination of whether an asset is capital depends on how it is held by a particular taxpayer.c. Bitcoin Activities Giving Rise to Ordinary IncomeWhether bitcoin is treated as a capital asset will chiefly depend on the taxpayer’s use of bitcoin or the activity from which the taxpayer earns bitcoin. For instance, for a person engaged in the “mining” of bitcoin, income produced by those efforts will likely result in ordinary income. See Notice 2014-21 at Q-8. A miner of bitcoin that later sells his bitcoin or uses it to purchase goods or services will recognize ordinary income, rather than a capital gain.With respect to mining, a strong analogy can be drawn between bitcoin and other commodities, the mining of which gives rise to ordinary income. See Prichard v. Helvering, 310 U.S. 404 (1940). Like other commodities, bitcoin is a finite resource that must be extracted from within a larger source. In this way, mining bitcoin, like mining ore or extracting oil from the earth, resembles a manufacturing activity which generates ordinary income upon disposition of the proceeds of the mining or manufacturing efforts.Further, one who “deals” in bitcoin, i.e. makes selling bitcoin his or her regular trade or business, will recognize ordinary income on any transactions resulting in a gain. See IRS Notice 2014-21 at Q-7. Conversely, one who merely “trades” in bitcoin will likely incur a capital, rather than ordinary, gain. The distinction between a dealer and a trader is a fine one, and largely hinges on whether the subject property is being sold to “customers,” as opposed to merely being traded on an exchange. Given the current state of the bitcoin market, and the paucity of recognized exchanges devoted to bitcoins, it may be difficult for a taxpayer to argue that he is a “trader” rather than a “dealer” in bitcoin, and thus entitled to capital gain treatment.An analogy can be made with guidance recently issued by the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which draws a distinction between “users” and “exchangers” of bitcoin for purposes of determining whether individuals or businesses will be considered money services businesses (MSB) for purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act. Under that guidance, individuals or businesses that mine and dispose of bitcoin for their own purposes, and not as a business service performed for others, are not treated by FinCEN as MSBs under the Bank Secrecy Act. Drawing upon that distinction, trading in bitcoin solely on one’s own account, as opposed to facilitating bitcoin transactions between third parties, or making a regular practice of selling bitcoin to third parties, should receive capital gain treatment.Additionally, an individual or business that receives bitcoin in exchange for sales of its inventory or for sales of the services that make up its regular trade or business will be required to treat the bitcoin earnings as ordinary income. Again, this is because the bitcoin was earned as a result of efforts that were within the taxpayer’s regular trade or business, not the sale or exchange of a capital asset.d. Bitcoin Activities Giving Rise to Capital GainsMore relevant to most taxpayers are the tax consequences of disposing of bitcoin that was purchased or received from a previous holder or was earned for performing activities not within the taxpayer’s regular trade or business. For instance, suppose a taxpayer purchases bitcoin as an investment for 100 dollars and its value later rises to 200 dollars. Upon disposition of the bitcoin in any manner, such as sale for 200 dollars in cash or the purchase of 200 dollars’ worth of goods or services, the taxpayer is likely to have 100 dollars of capital gain. Similarly, if the taxpayer purchased the bitcoin for 200 dollars, or performed services outside of his regular trade or business and received 200 dollars of bitcoin in receipt, then disposes of the bitcoin for property or services worth 400 dollars, that person will have 200 dollars of capital gain.This is so because absent the taxpayer’s status as a bitcoin dealer or one who holds bitcoin as inventory for sale in a regular trade or business, bitcoin does not appear to fall within any of the other exceptions of IRC § 1221 and therefore should be classified as a capital asset.In this way, using bitcoin for everyday transactions differs significantly from the use of cash.taxpayer’s gain and loss on the disposition of property is generally measured by reference to the taxpayer’s basis in the property, which is generally measured by the cost to acquire the property and the taxpayer’s subsequent investment in the property. When a disposition of property results in the receipt of value (such as money) in excess of the taxpayer’s basis in the property, then the taxpayer has realized a gain. When a disposition of property results in the receipt of value exceeded by the taxpayer’s basis in the property, then the taxpayer has realized a loss. See IRS Notice 2014-21 at Q-6.A taxpayer’s basis in cash is almost always the face value of the cash. Thus, in almost all instances, the taxpayer’s basis and amount realized are equal, and no gain or loss results for a buyer using cash. However, the tax treatment of purchases made with bitcoin more closely resemble barter transactions, in which property or services are exchanged for other property or services, without the use of money as a medium of exchange. In a barter transaction, the amount realized by the selling party is the fair market value of the property received in the exchange. See IRS Notice 2014-21 at Q-6. Due to bitcoin’s fluctuating value the resulting disconnect between a taxpayer’s basis in his bitcoin and the bitcoin’s market value, dispositions of bitcoin will likely generate gain or loss. Unless bitcoin’s value stabilizes significantly, the fact that tax consequences will likely result from each disposition of bitcoin could serve as a major obstacle to bitcoin ever becoming as liquid or freely used in the marketplace as cash.As was made clear in Notice 2014-21, for tax purposes transactions denominated in bitcoin or other virtual currencies must be reported in US dollars, which will require taxpayers to determine the fair market value of bitcoin income or bitcoin involved in a particular transaction in US dollars. Notice 2014-21 specifically states that a determination of fair market value can be made by reference to an exchange rate established by market supply and demand. However, all such exchange rate determinations must be reasonable and consistently applied by the taxpayer. See IRS Notice 2014-21 at Q-5.e. Basis TrackingBecause bitcoin has an established exchange rate, the fair market value of bitcoin should be easy to determine at any given moment. However, determining the fair market value at the time of bitcoin disposition is only half of the equation necessary to determine the gain realized from a disposition of bitcoin. The other half of the equation is the taxpayer’s basis in the bitcoin, generally the amount expended in acquiring the bitcoin under IRC § 1012.Keeping track of bitcoin basis will likely be an area of focus for any future IRS regulation because a number of questions, and potential areas for abuse, may result from unclear or incomplete rules for basis tracking. For instance, assume an individual buys 10 bitcoins on day 1 when bitcoin is worth 75 dollars each, 10 bitcoins on day 5 when bitcoin is worth 110 dollars each, and 10 more bitcoin on day 20 when bitcoin dropped in value to 100 dollars each. If the taxpayer then spends 7 bitcoins on day 30, what is his basis in those 7 bitcoins? The existence of the “block-chain” and the use of virtual wallets should simplify this determination. As stated previously, each bitcoin transaction is recorded and preserved for review in a public registry called the block-chain. Reference to the block-chain, and reference to the daily historical pricing of bitcoin, should permit a taxpayer to keep track of the dates he purchased or acquired bitcoin, as well as the price of the purchase. Further, using multiple virtual wallets should allow a bitcoin holder to segregate bitcoin purchases and thus avoid mixing bitcoin with different bases.However, issues remain. Assume, for example, that a taxpayer maintains a different virtual wallet for each bitcoin purchase. By segregating bitcoin in this manner, a bitcoin holder could potentially pick and choose which bitcoin he chooses to spend (most likely the bitcoin with the highest basis), thereby limiting his or her gain or creating a tax-beneficial loss. Along those same lines, assume a bitcoin holder does not segregate each bitcoin purchase into different virtual wallets. Instead, all bitcoins, some with different bases, are deposited into the same wallet. When a portion of those bitcoins is spent, how can the taxpayer determine which bitcoins, with which basis, were disposed of?There are a number of approaches the IRS could take with this question. For instance, the IRS could apply a Last in First Out (LIFO) or First in First Out (FIFO) methodology. Taking one of these approaches, i.e. arbitrarily determining which bitcoin was spent based on when it was acquired by the taxpayer, would ease the administrative burden on all parties, but could also unfairly, and adversely, impact taxpayers. For instance, in the example above, under the FIFO method, the taxpayer’s basis would be 525 dollars (7 of the last 10 bitcoins the taxpayer acquired at 75 dollars each). However, overall, the taxpayer’s basis in his bitcoins is, arguably, 95 dollars per bitcoin (30 bitcoins purchased for $2,850) and thus the basis in 7 bitcoins would be 665 dollars. In that circumstance, application of the FIFO method would increase the taxpayer’s gain (or decrease his loss). On the other hand, if the taxpayer were permitted to pick and choose which bitcoin were spent, the taxpayer could manipulate the transaction to ensure the bitcoins with the highest basis (and thus lowest realized gain or greatest loss realized) were utilized.These issues are not new. Similar issues have arisen when taxpayers have held different blocks of the same stock, i.e. shares of Microsoft purchased on different days and for different prices. Under current law, so long as a taxpayer can specifically identify the shares he or she wishes to sell, the taxpayer is permitted to pick and choose which shares to sell. See Treas. Reg. § 1.1012-1(c). If the taxpayer is unable to make a specific designation of shares to sell, the IRS applies the FIFO method (the first shares purchased are deemed to be the first shares sold). Similarly, if sold inventory cannot be specifically identified, the FIFO method is applied, but the IRC allows some room for sellers of inventory to elect LIFO treatment, or an averaging of costs across the entire quantity of inventory.The IRS takes a different tack with regard to allocating basis to partnership interests. Specifically, the Code requires the taxpayer acquiring partnership interests at varying times to pool the bases of all partnership interests and allocate the basis to the different interests based on their respective fair market values. So if a taxpayer buys a 5 percent interest for 1,000 dollars and later buys a 3 percent interest for 400 dollars (the value of the partnership having decreased) the taxpayer is assumed to have a basis of 1,400 dollars in his eight percent interest. If the taxpayer then sells half his partnership interest (4 percent), a basis of 700 dollars (half of the total basis) is attributed to the sale. See Rev. Rul. 84-53.For a bitcoin speculator or investor, the rules applicable to stock seem to be the most applicable, and may provide a hint as to how the IRS may apply ordering rules to dispositions of bitcoin acquired at different times and for different prices. If the IRS does adopt this approach, taxpayers would be wise to organize their bitcoin in a manner allowing for quick and easily verifiable determinations of the basis of specific groups of acquired bitcoin, which would allow the taxpayer to efficiently identify the bitcoin providing for the most tax beneficial result and provide any backup evidence requested by the IRS.We have every confidence that the bitcoin community will step into this breach and develop simple and elegant applications designed to allow bitcoin users to track their bases in their bitcoins for tax reporting purposes, including applications permitting full compliance with any ordering rules adopted by the IRS.V. Other IssuesThus far we have focused on the potential tax treatment of basic and fundamental transactions involving bitcoin. However, the tax issues raised by bitcoin do not stop there.a. FBAR ObligationsNotice 2014-21 makes no mention of the Bank Secrecy Act and its application to virtual currencies such as bitcoin, but we would be remiss to similarly ignore it. Under the Bank Secrecy Act, US persons (including corporations, partnerships, other business entities, and trusts) that have signatory authority over, or a beneficial interest in, a foreign financial account that reaches $10,000 in value at any time during the year must report such interest to FinCEN. This reporting obligation is known as the Foreign Bank Account Report obligation, or FBAR for short. Failure to make the required disclosure can give rise to significant civil penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal liability. Our past articles, such as those here, here, and here, have focused extensively on US taxpayer’s FBAR requirements and the tough stance taken by the IRS toward taxpayers that fail to make the required disclosures.In light of this requirement, what if a US person’s bitcoin is maintained on a computer server located abroad? Alternatively, what if a US person living abroad maintains his bitcoin on his personal computer? If the value of the bitcoin exceeds $10,000 during the year, must the bitcoin owner report the existence of the account to FinCEN? Current FBAR regulations do not address the treatment of bitcoin or other virtual currency, but strong arguments can be made that an FBAR reporting obligation is not imposed on bitcoin accounts held abroad.This is primarily due to the definition of “reportable accounts” set forth in 31 CFR § 1010.350. Under that regulation, the definition of “reportable accounts” covers bank accounts, securities accounts, and “other financial accounts,” which in turn includes accounts with persons in the business of accepting deposits as a financial agency, insurance or annuity accounts with a cash value, or accounts with brokers or dealers in futures or options contracts. A reserve of bitcoin would not seem to fall into any of those categories. More ominously, however, the final category of reportable accounts is described as an account with an “other investment fund,” with no elaboration as to what may constitute an “other investment fund.” Additionally, the IRS has imposed FBAR penalties for failure to report offshore, online gambling accounts, which do not seem to fall within the scope of “other financial accounts.”Nevertheless, based on the text of the FBAR regulations, it would appear that a reserve of bitcoin held abroad would fall outside the FBAR parameters. But it is a close question. Given that filing an FBAR is a relatively simple process, US persons holding significant stores of bitcoin abroad may wish to consider filing a protective FBAR. Moreover, the FBAR obligation is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to US persons’ obligation to report assets held abroad. For US persons holding significant amounts of bitcoin abroad, consultation with an experienced tax professional is strongly advised.b. Use of Bitcoin to Pay WagesWhat if an employer pays his employee in bitcoin? Notice 2014-21 makes clear that the IRS will treat the payment as compensation in the form of wages. See IRS Notice 2014-21 at Q-11. Payment of wages in bitcoin will constitute ordinary income to the employee and, generally, a capital gain (to the extent there is gain) to the employer. Moreover, like any other wages paid to an employee, the payment will be subject to withholding for income tax, as well as FICA (to fund Federal social security) and FUTA (to fund Federal unemployment compensation) taxes. See IRS Notice 2014-21 at Q-11. Obligations owed to the IRS must be paid in US dollars thus requiring the employer to set aside dollars to deposit the required withholding or to liquidate bitcoin in order to generate dollars to pay the required withholding.IRS Notice 2014-21 that independent contractors who receive payment in bitcoin, or individuals who mine bitcoin as part of a trade or business and not as an employee, are subject to self-employment tax, just as if they had received US dollars for their efforts. See Notice 2014-21 at Q-9, 10.c. Compliance FailuresAt Q-16, IRS Notice 2014-21 addresses the issue of whether a taxpayer will be subject to penalties for treating transactions inconsistently with the Notice prior to its issuance date (March 25, 2014) by stating, simply, that taxpayers may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with tax laws, including underpaying the tax due as a result of virtual currency transactions. The Notice goes on to state that penalty relief may be available upon a showing of reasonable cause.Two things stand out about the IRS’s position here. The first is that, implicitly, the IRS is indicating that treating bitcoin transactions in a manner that is inconsistent with the Notice after March 25, 2014 will more likely give rise to penalties and that establishing reasonable cause sufficient to abate the penalties will be difficult for post-Notice issuance non-compliance. Second, the reasonable cause standard cited in the Notice is the standard that is generally applied in penalty abatement determinations. Thus, the IRS has given no indication that special (more lenient) treatment will be given to taxpayers against whom penalties are assessed simply because those penalties arise from bitcoin income or transactions.VI. ConclusionThe issues addressed in Notice 2014-21 and this article are just a few of the vast number of tax issues raised by the wider use of bitcoin in the marketplace. For unresolved issues, taxpayers are best served by reporting any bitcoin-based income or other taxable events and to take reasonable positions regarding the taxability of those transactions. Given the uncertainty surrounding the proper treatment of every single variety of bitcoin-based income and transactions, the advice of professional and experienced tax professionals is crucial for proper reporting and avoiding future problems with the IRS.The attorneys at Fuerst Ittleman David & Joseph have extensive experience in handling complex tax planning and reporting obligations for individuals and businesses. We will continue to monitor the regulation of bitcoin and the impact of such regulation on the tax and non-tax obligations of individuals and businesses.You may contact us by calling 305.3560.5690 or by emailing us at [email protected]",

    "text": "The Blockchain creates and records all digital currency transactions using mathematics.The Bitcoin blockchain uses the computing power on Earth to solve these math problems that confirm transactions made using the digital currency Bitcoin.As many are familiar with the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, many people still don’t understand blockchain’s other uses. The blockchain saves aspects of each transaction made using the currency; small transactions can be made in which information is stored. This allows for the possibility of signing and permanently recording legally binding documents.Blocksign is allowing individuals to harness this ability.Blocksign is a service that lets people digitally sign legally binding documents and preserve a private record of their signed document in the blockchain, where they can access it for free forever. Blocksign uses the decentralized public ledger of the block chain to sign, timestamp, and allow you to later verify the authenticity of a document that has been block signed.I met Nicholas Thorne, the co-creator of Blocksign, who answered some questions about this service.Kevin Cruz: How does Blocksign work?Nicholas Thorne: Upload a document from a computer or Dropbox, place a signature wherever you’d like, and download the signed document.Once the document has been signed, it is sent to Blocksign, where a cryptographic hash (32-digit string of letters and numbers) is made out of the document. It is then recorded on the blockchain like all bitcoin transactions. That’s it.If you want to verify a document you go through the same process and Blocksign searches the blockchain for that hash to see if it has ever been logged before, if so returning information verifying the authenticity of the document. We have also published documentation of this methodology so that signed document records can always be verified here: https://github.com/blocksign/blocksignWhat’s the benefit?Signing documents and contracts can often be a confusing or tedious process. Blocksign provides a solution that makes it easy to sign a document, while also providing an incredible way to permanently preserve verifiable records of what you’ve signed.The document signing process is really just about communication, and exceptional record keeping is an extension of that.What is your professional background?I started my career as an investment banking analyst [at] Goldman Sachs. I basically spent 120 hours per week building financial models of technology and media companies. I left there after a few years to start a digital badge company called Basno with a group of partners. Blocksign is a product of Basno.What are you currently occupied with?Blocksign is a product of Basno, which is a company that we started in 2011 around exploring ways in which identity, trust, and verification take form online. Basno’s first product, is a platform for creating, collecting, and verifying credentials. The Basno team has been interested in bitcoin and the blockchain for some time and over the past 6 months we began to really explore how we might be able to leverage the blockchain technology around our existing expertise and ultimately arrived at Blocksign, which was just launched in the middle [of] August.What is your vision for Blocksign?Our vision for Blocksign has a number of components, some more immediately actionable than others. First and foremost, however, we want to make signing documents and contracts as easy and useful as possible. There is a tremendous amount of important information and value embodied in contracts and agreements, yet traditionally they are just thought of as tedious paperwork that you just need to get done. Attaching an image that looks like a traditional signature to a PDF doesn’t do justice to the inherent potential of contracts and documents and our current technology.We think step one in that process is making an easy to use product, and step two is doing so in a way where the records are preserved in a decentralized ledger that guarantees exceptional record keeping and authentication. Beyond that there is a vast array of use cases that we are excited about, which is one of the reasons why we are spending time building out an API that others can use and take advantage of.If the block chain is to achieve its full potential that the average person will need to be able to easily and understandably interface with the technology.We believe further that the act of signing is one of the fundamental user interaction models for the blockchain. We think of it as a method of committing to something and of authorizing some thing or some behavior. So we really think that signing or using your signature will be something that becomes a very common element of how people interact with block chain technologies and applications, which is why we’ve started with building the product that we have.",

    "text": "California’s First Bitcoin ATMRobocoin, a Las Vegas based company specializing in the first bi-directional Bitcoin ATM, will be unveiling California’s first Bitcoin ATM at the 500 Startups’ Bitcoinference. On Thursday, March 20, the company will make buying and selling Bitcoin possible, all from a single machine. Held in Mountain View, California, the sold-out conference will by a half-day “un-conference” featuring industry leading companies throughout the Bitcoin community, as well as speakers from all aspects of cryptocurrency.Speaking at the Bitcoinference will be Dan Held, Co-founder of ZeroBlock, Connie Gallippi, Founder of the BitGive Foundation, Dave McClure and Sean Percival of 500 Startups, among many others. The 500 Startups’ conference gives attendees the opportunity to join 100+ commerce startups, e-retailers and thought leaders in the industry.Robocoin will head to Mountain View, the epicenter of technology, to introduce the Robocoin Bitcoin ATM. The company’s technology itself allows customers to exchange Bitcoin and cash. The bi-directional approach provides the ability to both buy and sell Bitcoin, combining the trust and automation of online exchanges from a single ATM.“We’re setting the precedent for bitcoin ATMs and demonstrating to California’s citizens and regulators just how this exchange should be run with respect to Anti-Money Laundering compliance and consumer protection,” Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley stated. “Our Robocoin Operator shares our vision of bringing bitcoin to the world the right way.”Robocoin allows customers to buy Bitcoin by using various security measures to verify the user’s identity; all that is needed is a government ID, palm print, email, face and cash. Additionally, Robocoin also gives users the ability to sell Bitcoins by using the same security measures and by sending Bitcoin to Robocoin, receiving a ticket and waiting for one bitcoin confirmation.The growth of the unique platform has continued since late last year. In October of 2013, Robocoin introduced its first Bitcoin ATM in Vancouver, which shortly followed its first ATM in the United States, in Austin, TX. And just last week, the company sent 10 Robocoin units overseas.The 500 Startups’ Bitcoinference will take place on Thursday, March 20 at 444 Castro Street, #1200 in Mountain View, California. The event begins at 2:00PM.Bitcoin ATMs are one of the easiest ways to get cryptocurrency without an exchange account or even a bank account.About RobocoinLas Vegas-based Robocoin is a bi-directional ATM that lets customers buy and sell Bitcoin. Robocoin combines the trust and automation of online exchanges with the convenience of in-person transactions. The software and hardware behind Robocoin’s Bitcoin ATM is creating consumer accessibility to digital currency. The inclusion of Biometric hand scanning, government issued ID scanning and webcam were built to adhere to FinCEN law, anti money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance.",

    "text": "I went to the Texas Bitcoin Conference. It was a great event overall but one part really stuck with me: the concert, or “Bitcoincert” held at the end of the conference. This “Bitcoincert” was the first ever “Bitcoin-exclusive” concert, where tickets could only be purchased using Bitcoin.One performer at the Bitcoincert specifically caught my full attention: a Jazz and R&B singer, songwriter, and recording artist by the name of Carolyn Malachi.She and her band brought a new groove to the conference; she even had the crowd participate with her in performing some funky tunes. I found myself head-bobbing without thinking twice about it.I had to know more about her. And luckily, I did.After speaking with her, I learned that she was a Grammy- nominated artist: her single “Orion” received a Grammy award nomination for Best Urban / Alternative performance in 2011.I asked her about her musical background.“Growing up in Washington, DC,” she explained, “afforded me the luxury of a thriving cultural scene. By listening to Jazz, Go-Go music, and other genres, I developed an appreciation for the ways in which various forms of music can work together. The exposure guides my genre-blending creative process today, and for that, I am grateful.”I wondered about Carolyn’s connection to Bitcoin and learned she is a part of Bitcoin history—being the very first recording artist to accept Bitcoin payments for her music. It turned out she discovered it on a Bloomberg article last year, then she began accepting it in October of 2013, so her fans who live in countries with no PayPal access can purchase her music with this new currency. “The cryptocurrency”, she says, ” is already proving to be a game changer for people in emerging markets – particularly women – who need an alternative to traditional methods of payment.”“Bitcoin”, she added, “connects to the idea of music, because music is about freedom and when musicians play, we feel free, and it’s an invitation to the audience to participate in that freedom.”I asked her how she ended up at the Bitcoin conference, and she said she was looking for Bitcoin-related events to be a part of and discovered the Texas Bitcoin Conference. Carolyn and her team spoke to Paul Snow from the Texas Bitcoin Association, and set up the concert. The rest was history.Also in reference to the Bitcoincert performance, Carolyn said ” We dared to dream it. It’s important to start creating things that aren’t there. Have daring thoughts; bold, daring, good thoughts and pursue them because they can absolutely come true and this is proof.”Bitcoin was once merely an idea, but since it was developed and solidified as a protocol, it has become one of the most revolutionary ideas of the century. So yes, our dreams truly are powerful.You can visit Carolyn’s website at http://carolynmalachi.com/",

    "text": "Just got dumped?We all know the feeling: you read an article promising wonders, getting all pumped up and then…Well, the one thing that nerds love, data, is helping to solve this social problem when it comes to getting dumped in the world of alternative currencies.In an era of numerous altcoins, deciding which ones are a buy, sell or hold can become an arduous task for an individual. Thankfully, your life is about to become a lot easier thanks to CoinGecko.What is CoinGecko?CoinGecko is cryptocurrency ranking and evaluation site that breaks down quantitative and qualitative data for a number of different metrics. The metrics used include items such as Twitter followers, Reddit subscribers, coin community, the cost of a 51 attack, the number of developers working on the coin and much more to provide an overall score of the coin and a rating for each category.You would not believe all the meticulous sorts of data that can be used to determine a coin’s value. No need to do that though, CoinGecko illustrates this data in a clean user interface and nice graphs and now CoinGecko has an alpha version of their dashboard (below).The story of CoinGecko starts with its founders, Bobby Ong and TM Lee. Bobby is a University College London Economics graduate while TM Lee is a Purdue University Computer Science graduate. At UCL, Bobby learned all about financial stability and prevention of bank runs with federal deposit insurance schemes. However, as Bobby saw with Cyprus in 2013, “the trust between government and savers can be broken when depositors are forced to take a haircut on their savings.”This one incident got Bobby thinking about Bitcoin and how there is some sort of inherent “underlying utility to this sort of digital asset.” But after getting involved in Bitcoin, Bobby got lost in a sea of altcoins.Bobby and TM, like a lot of people, read some articles about this and that altcoin, and they bought some coins on “gut feeling” without doing much research.“Some purchases did well, but some did pretty bad.”Bobby learned more about trading strategies on cryptocurrencies and found that there are “several fundamental reasons why certain altcoins may hold good value in the mid/long term. The basic idea goes along the line of technical innovation, community strength and developer team.”Dogecoin, what a joke Bobby once thought: “Who would buy into a me-too copy with dogs.”What Bobby failed to realize was that Dogecoin had a great community supporting it and developers working hard to see it succeed.“I decided to dig deep into the Dogecoin community numbers and found out that they are pretty impressive. Looking at the Dogecoin subreddit and how active the community members there, I became an instant Dogecoin convert and started mining Dogecoin myself.”Realizing what he had missed out, it came to him.“I thought that it would be a good idea to collect all this information to rank and benchmark other cryptocurrencies.”Bobby went to his friend, TM who had also missed out on the Dogecoin phenomena and they decided to give this idea a whirl. Since then the two have been making better trades.“We wanted to help people make more quantitative decisions before buying cryptocurrencies and help provide a 360 degree overview by looking at a lot more metrics.”Since CoinGecko launched in April it has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Reddit and bitcointalk forum. It was already a top post on the Dogecoin reddit thread. The interface is easy to use with information presented clearly.There is still a lot going on for CoinGecko; they are adding new coins and metrics every week to get a more comprehensive view of each coin compared to others. Maybe they will even add live charts to make it the perfect investment tool, but hey, who knows?",

    "text": "This article originally appeared in Bitcoin Magazine Issue 27There’s a lot of misunderstanding around the terms “virtual” and “digital,” and people often mistakenly use them interchangeably. The reality is that virtual currencies are a type of digital currency, meaning that all virtual currencies are digital, but the converse is incorrect. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are another type of digital currency, but they are in a separate category from virtual ones. Other types of digital currency also exist, and understanding which is which can become confusing.Digital currencies are exactly what they sound like: currencies stored and transferred electronically. Any money based in 1’s and 0’s meets this definition; dollars stored in a bank account are supposed to be a representation of dollars actually held somewhere, whereas physical bitcoins are a representation of their digital counterparts. One could argue that our increasingly cashless society means that all currencies are becoming digital (sometimes referred to as “electronic money”), but they are not presented to us as such.Real digital currencies have been around for some time. One of the first was E-gold, founded in 1996 and backed by gold. Another known digital currency exchange was Liberty Reserve, founded in 2006; it let users convert dollars or euros to Liberty Reserve Dollars or Euros, and exchange them freely with one another at a 1 fee. Both services were centralized, reputed to be used for money laundering, and inevitably shut down by the US government. Online payment services like PayPal (founded 1998) function similarly, based on traditional currency, except with more restrictions and government compliance (ensuring their survival).Based on offshore tax havens beloved by the wealthy and unscrupulous, early digital currencies gave the industry a bad image. Virtual currencies, by contrast, are intended to be light-hearted and fun: they, too, have been around far longer than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and are used primarily for online entertainment in virtual worlds. “Virtual” can be defined as “not based in physical reality,” and virtual currencies are those which are not intended for use in “real life,” or expenditure on real assets. They are, in another word, toys.Pretty much all virtual currencies are centralized, with control of the money supply resting in the hands of the virtual world’s developers. Most massive multiplayer online games hire trained economists for this sort of thing, and their power dwarfs that of the American Federal Reserve. When they want to increase the money supply, they add some new quests with increased gold rewards. If they want to shrink the money supply, they add what are called “sinks,” which usually amount to expensive new vanity items, vehicles, etc. that are purchased from a non-player character, thus vanishing the money back into the game. A new update can completely change the game’s economy and cripple a player’s enterprise.Virtual currency developers vary in how much interaction they allow their system to have with “real” currencies. At the extreme end of the spectrum, World of Warcraft is very strict; Blizzard does this primarily to avoid legal headaches, as their currency would incur taxes if the government recognized it as having actual value. In order to maintain the perception that their virtual gold is fake, violating this rule is punishable by a permanent ban, and they actively search for accounts involved with real-money trading. Many items bind to an account upon acquisition; since this restricts the free flow of goods, the net effect of such restrictions is to reduce the scope of the game’s economy.Other online game developers want to promote a deeper and more dynamic virtual economy, such as the team behind EVE Online. EVE, if you’re not familiar, is a very complicated online space-faring game, replete with drop-down menus and statistics. Players construct corporations and empires spanning galaxies, in a massive game-world where almost the entire experience is built by players on top of existing economic infrastructure. While there is a pre-defined set of things a player can do, the variety of their interactions forms a stunningly complex system. Their biggest war ever cost over $250,000 in virtual destruction.The EVE Online developers still issue ongoing updates as players discover exploits that throw the economy out of whack, and maintain certain restrictions. While all items can be freely traded, EVE still has to maintain that its virtual currency has no real value. Technically, you cannot buy ISK with dollars, but you can buy game time cards, which can be traded in-game for ISK. You cannot, however, redeem cards for cash, and while real-money trading is far more extensive than in games like WoW, it is technically prohibited.At the far end of the spectrum are virtual worlds like Second Life, an online life simulator developed by Linden Labs. Linden Labs tolerates the exchange of Linden Dollars and real-world currency, but they still control the supply of Linden Dollars. One can openly make a living and earn traditional currency with a successful in-game enterprise; however, Linden Dollars are still a virtual currency because Linden Dollars are practically never redeemed directly for real goods or services. Some players may have made a fortune from it in real estate, but it’s still a game.Other digital currencies, meanwhile, are redeemed for physical goods and services all the time. You can order products via PayPal, for example. Bitcoin used to be thought of as “Internet money,” but you can now spend it in person at physical businesses. This makes them similar to traditional money in that respect, and makes them more “real.” Cryptocurrencies are designed to be capable of replacing cash, and there’s nothing virtual about that.The other obvious factor differentiating cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin from other digital currencies is that they’re generally decentralized. No central power (such as a group of video game developers) has arbitrary control over the money supply. World of Warcraft, EVE Online, and Second Life all have servers, which the developers can manipulate at will (or shut off entirely), but Bitcoin runs on a network of participating computers that agree to the same standard.Unlike such centralized currencies, bitcoins are mined at a mathematically-controlled rate, and their supply subject only to free market demand. This distinguishes them from traditional currencies like the dollar, as well, which follow the decision-making of central banks. The cryptography inherent in cryptocurrency also makes it more anonymous than any real or virtual currencies, which are tracked by banks and developers, respectively.There are still some unanswered questions. Where does the virtual world end, and reality begin? Is owning an image in a game so different from owning an image on a website? The amount of time people spend in online games will continue to climb as the technology advances, to the point that many will covet virtual property more than physical. This could lead to virtual currencies becoming real digital currencies, or traditional and digital currencies entering the virtual space.The lines are getting blurry in the world of currency. As banks go online and plastic becomes ubiquitous, physical cash is becoming antiquated. Electronic money has already taken over, but digital currency is taking things a step further: for the first time in history, people are thinking in terms of numbers, not coins and bills. Once everyone realizes that the majority of the “cash” in the world exists in banks’ computers, with no hard money backing it at all, they won’t see the effective difference.Illustration by Indiana Joel.",

    "text": "The continent of Africa, in particularly Ghana, is set to open doors of opportunity to a land perceived as hopeless in the eyes of many.The internet has provided decentralized information that allows some of these marginalized populations to educate themselves, and the development of the blockchain represents decentralized wealth controllable by the people.Africa will be getting Dreamcoins. Dreamcoin is a community cryptocurrency being designed for merchants and consumers in sub-Saharan Africa.DreamCoin creator Phillip Agyei Asare explains it:Dreamcoin is a purely African initiative, unlike Kipochi which was backed by Danes, and BitPesa that is backed by Americans and Britons. Dreamcoin partners are in Ghana, my home country, as well as members from Botswana, Uganda, and most recently Sierra Leone. This is a powerful and meaningful achievement, given that Dreamcoin, therefore even in its early stages represents broader ethnic and linguistic diversity within its core Dreamcoin community, than that of Western Europe or the Americas.Dreamcoin is backed by the commitments from participating merchants to accept Dreamcoins at an assigned fixed value, such as 1 US Dollar, 1 Euro, etc. The assigned value will be a function of initially expressed and identified interests.DreamCoin is an implementation of non-profit organization Conscious Entrepreneurship Foundation (CEF)'s Coins For Causes initiative.Charles Evans, founder of the CEF, explains the idea for Dreamcoins:The idea is to use something like Counterparty to issue vouchers that can be redeemed for, e.g., $1 worth of goods and services from participating merchants. A supporter could raise an endowment fund and stand ready to buy the vouchers, in order to put a floor under their value. For example, if you knew that someone would buy the things from you at $1 each, you might be more inclined to hold them, and you more or less would be able to predict their value in the near future. DreamCoin is slightly different in that the initial supporters do not have thousands of dollars in cash sitting around, but each member of the core group of supporters is willing to give away some goods and services in exchange for the vouchers, in the hope that this will make them attractive to prospective users and enable them to bootstrap a market in them.The Dreamcoin operation started out relatively small, and if the initial experiment succeeds, then it could be enough to prime the pump.Philip Nana Asare has been busy developing a non-profit organization called The Dream-Bitcoin Foundation (DBF), which was officially registered in Ghana on September 9, 2014. The Dream-Bitcoin Foundation will help empower and unite the youth in Ghana, and Africa in general, to successfully enter entrepreneurship through acquiring an education in Bitcoin and the Blockchain and cryptocurrencies and creating their adoption throughout the country. Together with partners from other African nations, the adoption of Bitcoin will be made easier via SMS. Philip is also working on a website that will offer Bitcoin payment processing that will be used in selling African products online to the international market. Africa will become a pioneer in the adoption of cryptocurrencies, and benefit accordingly in this new, emerging economy, says Philip. Philip is a graduate of Central University College in Ghana, where he studied Bsc. Administration (HRM). He is the Founder and CEO of Pak Universal Services, which offers quality service including bulk messaging solutions; Internet/information, marketing consultancy and training; domain registration and hosting; fashion and design, web design; and general printing. PAKSMSGH is an arm of Pak Universal Services and is one of the leading Short Message Service (SMS) gateway providers in Africa, and is No.1 in Ghana for customized bulk SMS text messaging, delivering to over 600 networks in over 200 countries all around the world. PAKSMSGH is a web-based mobile communication platform that allows you to send text messages from your computer or internet-enabled devices, to literally thousands of mobile phones at once. PAKSMSGH offers you the least expensive and yet most effective SMS solutions, and is known for delivering quality service, says Philip.Philip and his partners are working closely with different members of the Bitcoin community and inviting willing participants to come to his land to explore the great potential that is Africa. Dream-Bitcoin Foundation is currently raising funds in bitcoin [see bottom of article] for projects that will enable young entrepreneurs in Africa to establish their various bitcoin businesses online, in effect giving them access to a new international market. Dreamcoin is currently working closely with individuals in the West/North, including Dr. Charles Evans of the Conscious Entrepreneurship Foundation in South Florida; Song E. Lee and Johann Barbie of 37Coins in Sunnyvale, California; Bitcoin Bear in Rescue, California; Tim Tayshun of http://www.ezcoinaccess.com/; and Rob Agnew of Coinapult in Panama. They are interested in working with any other interested cryptocurrency organizations. One problem with Bitcoin is its short-run volatility, says Charles Evans. The hope is that DreamCoin will be useless as a speculative game, because of its stable value, and useful as a cash-like asset for small-scale entrepreneurs in the Emerging Middle-Income Countries (EMICs). Cryptocurrency is proving to be a stronger binding tie among nations of the world than legacy colonial borders. Ghana Dream Bitcoin Foundation is proud to present the first Regional Bitcoin Seminar at the Kumasi Polythenic.Join DBF from the 5th of December until the 7th of December. The event will include inspiring lectures, insightful knowledge and endless networking with students and young professionals in Ghana. Information will be disseminated about Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, says Phillip. This event will feature tremendous speakers and panels on the ideas behind a free society and the actions necessary to implement them. In addition, free meals and drinks and an evening social event will be included for your FREE registration. Don't miss out on your chance to be a part of this great event. The use of Cryptocurrency technology can cause an evolution in human relations. Since tribal ties in Rwanda and Kenya are so much stronger than national ties, most interactions between the two often end in violence. When two groups are enabled to work more closely with each other by utilizing a stable method of exchange, the prospect of prosperity for both parties will encourage further cooperation. This will allow us to work with neighbors whose doors are literally within walking distance of our own, and with brothers and sisters who are foreign to Africa. concludes Philip. This will, in turn, enable Ghana, and then Africa in general, to fulfill her dreams and potential in the global community. Ultimately, blockchain technology will help in bringing wealth to a land plagued by poverty. A decentralized system like bitcoin will spur interconnected hubs of prosperity that function beyond national boundaries.Visit the new Foundation website here.1CPGByjASvkLN7mLZP9cz4nRaaUXHsEXtp Donate to this cause in BTC by using the address or QR above.",

    "text": "The author of this article, Vitalik Buterin, is also the founder of Ethereum, and this article is intended as an expository piece and not a review.Over the past year, there has been an increasingly large amount of discussion around so-called “Bitcoin 2.0″ protocols – alternative cryptographic networks that are inspired by Bitcoin, but which intend to make the underlying technology usable for far more than just currency. The earliest implementation of this idea was Namecoin, a Bitcoin-like currency created in 2010 which would be used for decentralized domain name registration. More recently, we have seen the emergence of colored coins, allowing users to create their own currencies on the Bitcoin network, and more advanced protocols like Mastercoin, Bitshares and Counterparty which intend to provide features such as financial derivatives, savings wallets and decentralized exchange. However, up until this point all of the protocols that have been invented have been specialized, attempting to offer detailed feature sets targeted toward specific industries or applications usually financial in nature. Now, a group of developers including myself have come up with a project that takes the opposite track: a cryptocurrency network that intends to be as generalized as possible, allowing anyone to create specialized applications on top for almost any purpose imaginable. The project: Ethereum.Cryptocurrency Protocols Are Like Onions…One common design philosophy among many cryptocurrency 2.0 protocols is the idea that, just like the internet, cryptocurrency design would work best if protocols split off into different layers. Under this strain of thought, Bitcoin is to be thought of as a sort of TCP/IP of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and other next-generation protocols can be built on top of Bitcoin much like we have SMTP for email, HTTP for webpages and XMPP for chat all on top of TCP as a common underlying data layer.So far, the three main protocols that have followed this model are colored coins, Mastercoin and Counterparty. The way the colored coins protocol works is simple. First, in order to create colored coins, a user tags specific bitcoins as having a special meaning; for example, if Bob is a gold issuer, he may wish to tag some set of bitcoins and say that each satoshi represents 0.1 grams of gold redeemable from him. The protocol then tracks those bitcoins through the blockchain, and in that way it is possible to calculate who owns them at any time.Mastercoin and Counterparty are somewhat more abstract; they use the Bitcoin blockchain to store data, so a Mastercoin or Counterparty transaction is a Bitcoin transaction, but the protocols interpret the transactions in a completely different way. One can have two Mastercoin transactions, one sending 1 MSC and the other 100000 MSC, but from the point of view of a Bitcoin user that does not know how that Mastercoin protocol works they both look like small transactions sending 0.0006 BTC each; the Mastercoin-specific metadata is encoded in the transaction outputs. A Mastercoin client then needs to search the Bitcoin blockchain for Mastercoin transactions in order to determine the current Mastercoin balance sheet.I personally have had the privilege of talking directly to many of the originators of the colored coins and Mastercoin protocol, and have participated considerably in the development of both projects. However, over about two months of research and particpation, what I eventually came to realize is that, while the underlying idea of having such high-level protocols on top of low-level protocols is laudable, there are fundamental flaws in the implementations, as they stand today, that may well prevent the projects from ever gaining anything more than a small amount of traction.The reason is not that the ideas behind the protocols themselves are bad; the ideas are excellent, and the response of the community alone is proof that they are trying to do something that is very much needed. Rather, the reason is that the low-level protocol that they are trying to build their high-level protocols on top of, Bitcoin, is simply not cut out for the task. This is not to say that Bitcoin is bad, or is not a revolutionary invention; as a protocol for storing and transferring value, Bitcoin is excellent. However, as far as being an effective low-level protocol is concerned, Bitcoin is less effective; rather than being like a TCP on top of which one can build HTTP, Bitcoin is like SMTP: a protocol that is good at its intended task (in SMTP’s case email, in Bitcoin’s case money), but not particularly good as a foundation for anything else.The specific failure of Bitcoin is particularly concentrated in one place: scalability. Bitcoin itself is as scalable as a cryptocurrency can be; even if the blockchain balloons to over a terabyte, there is a protocol called “simplified payment verification”, described in the Bitcoin whitepaper that allows “light clients” with only a few megabytes of bandwidth and storage to securely determine whether or not they have received transactions. With colored coins and Mastercoin, however, this possibility disappears. The reason is this. In order to determine what color a colored coin is, you need to not just use Bitcoin simplified payment verification to prove that it exists; you also need to trace it all the way back to its genesis, and do an SPV check each step of the way. Sometimes, the backward scan is exponential; and with metacoin protocols there is no way to know anything at all without verifying every single transaction.And this is what Ethereum intends to fix. Ethereum does not intend to be a Swiss Army knife protocol with hundreds of features to suit every need; instead, Ethereum aims to be a superior foundational protocol, and allow other decentralized applications to build on top of it instead of Bitcoin, giving them more tools to work with and allowing them to gain the full benefits of Ethereum’s scalability and efficiency.At the time that Ethereum was being developed, there was a large amount of interest in allowing financial contracts on top of cryptocurrencies; the basic type of contract being a “contract for difference”. In a contract for difference, two parties agree to put in some amount of money, and then get money out in a proportion that depends on the value of some underlying asset. For example, a CFD might have Alice put in $1000, Bob put in $1000, and then after 30 days the blockchain would automatically return to Alice $1000 plus $100 for every dollar that the LTC/USD price went up during that time period and send Bob the rest. These contracts allow people to speculate on assets at high leverage, or alternatively protect themselves from cryptocurrency volatility by canceling out their exposure, without any centralized exchange.At this point, however, it is clear that contracts for difference are really only one special case of a much more general concept: contracts for formula. Instead of having the contract take in $x for Alice, $y from Bob, and return to Alice $x plus an additional $z for every dollar that some given ticker went up, a contract should be able to return to A an amount of funds based on any mathematical formula, allowing contracts of arbitrary complexity. If the formula allows random data as inputs, these generalized CFDs can even be used to implement a sort of peer-to-peer gambling.Ethereum takes this idea and pushes it one step further. Instead of contracts being agreements between two parties that start and end, contracts in Ethereum are like a sort of autonomous agent simulated by the blockchain. Each Ethereum contract has its own internal scripting code, and the scripting code is activated every time a transaction is sent to it. The scripting language has access to the transaction’s value, sender and optional data fields, as well some block data and its own internal memory, as inputs, and can send transactions. To make a CFD, Alice would create a contract and seed it with $1000 worth of cryptocurrency, and then wait for Bob to accept the contract by sending a transction containing $1000 as well. The contract would then be programmed to start a timer, and after 30 days Alice or Bob would be able to send a small transaction to the contract to activate it again and release the funds.Aside from this narrow contract-for-difference model, however, the whitepaper outlines many other transaction types that will become possible with Ethereum scripting, of which a few include: Code example of an Ethereum currency contract, written in a high-level language.if tx.value < 100 * block.basefee: stopif contract.memory[1000]: from = tx.sender to = tx.data[0] value = tx.data[1] if to <= 1000: stop if contract.memory[from] < value: stop contract.memory[from] = contract.memory[from] - value contract.memory[to] = contract.memory[to] + valueelse: contract.memory[mycreator] = 10000000000000000 contract.memory[1000] = 1Multisignature escrows, of a similar spirit to the Bitcoin arbitration service Bitrated, but with more complex rules than Bitcoin. For example, there will be no need for the signers to pass around partially signed transactions manually; people can authorize a withdrawal asynchronously over the blockchain one at a time and then have the transaction finalized automatically once enough people make their authorizations.Savings accounts - one interesting setup works as follows. Suppose that Alice wants to store a large amount of money, but does not want to risk losing everything if her private key is lose or stolen. She makes a contract with Bob, a semi-trustworthy bank, with the following rules: Alice is allowed to withdraw up to 1 per day, Alice with Bob approval can withdrawn any amount, and Bob alone can withdraw up to 0.05 per day. Normally, Alice will only need small amounts at a time, and if Alice wants more she can prove her identity to Bob and make the withdrawal. If Alice's private key gets stolen, she can run to Bob and move the funds into another contract before the thief gets away with more than 1 of the funds. If Alice loses her private key, Bob will eventually be able to recover her funds. And if Bob turns out to be evil, Alice can withdraw her own funds twenty times faster than he can. In short, all of the security of traditional banking, but with almost none of the trust.Peer-to-peer gambling - any kind of peer-to-peer gambling protocol can be implemented on top of Ethereum. A very basic protocol would simply be a contract for difference on random data such as a block hash.Creating your own currency - using Ethereum's internal memory store, you can create an entire new currency inside of Ethereum. These new currencies can be constructed to interact with each other, have a decentralized exchange, or any other kind of advanced features.This is the advantage of Ethereum code: because the scripting language is designed to have no restrictions except for a fee system, essentially any kind of rules can be encoded inside of it. One can even have an entire company manage its savings on the blockchain, with a contract saying that, for example, 60 of the current shareholders of a company are needed to agree to move any funds (and perhapps 30 can move a maximum of 1 per day). Other, less traditionally capitalistic, structures are also possible; one idea is for a democratic organization with the only rule being that two thirds of the existing members of a group must agree to invite another member.Beyond the FinancialThe financial applications, however, only scratch the surface of what Ethereum, and cryptographic protocols on top of Ethereum, can do. While Ethereum's financial applications may be what initially excites many people in the cryptocurrency community, the long-term promise is arguably in the ways that Ethereum can work together with other, non-financial, peer-to-peer protocols. One of the main problems that non-financial peer-to-peer protocols have faced so far is the lack of incentive - that is to say, unlike centralized for-profit platforms, there is no financial reason to participate. In some cases, participation is in some sense its own reward; it is for this reason that people continue to write open source software, contribute to Wikipedia, and make comments on forums and write blog posts. In the context of peer-to-peer protocols, however, participation is often not a \"fun\" activity in any meaningful sense; rather, it consists of putting in a large quantity of resources, letting a daemon run in the background potentially hogging CPU and battery power, and forgetting about it.For example, there have already for a long time been data protocols such as Freenet that essentially provide everyone with decentralized uncensorable static content hosting; in practice, however, Freenet is very slow, and few people contribute resources. File sharing protocols all suffer from the same problem: although altruism is good enough for spreading popular commercial blockbusters around, it becomes markedly less effective for those with less mainstream preferences. Thus, perversely, the peer-to-peer nature of file sharing may actually be helping the centralization of entertainment and media production, not hindering it. All of these problems, however, can potentially be solved if we add incentivization - empowering people to build not just nonprofit side projects, but also businesses and livelihoods, around participating in the network.Incentivized data storage - essentially, a decentralized Dropbox. The idea works as follows: if a user wants to have a 1GB file backed up by the network, they would construct a data structure known as a Merkle tree out of the data. They would then put the root of the tree, along with 10 ether, into a contract and upload the file onto another specialized network that nodes wishing to rent out their hard drive space would listen for messages on. Every day, the contract would automatically pick a random branch of the tree (eg. \"left -> right -> left -> left -> left -> right -> left\"), ending at a block of the file, and give 0.01 ether to the first node to provide that branch. Nodes would store the entire file to maximize their chance of getting the reward.BitMessage and Tor - Bitmessage is a next-generation email protocol that is both fully decentralized and encrypted, allowing anyone to send messages to any other Bitmessage user securely without relying on any third parties except for the network. However, Bitmessage has one large usability flaw: instead of sending messages to human-friendly email addresses, like \"myname@email, you need to send to garbled 34-character Bitmessage addresses (eg. \"BM-BcbRqcFFSQUUmXFKsPJgVQPSiFA3Xash\"). Ethereum contracts offer a solution: people can register their names on a special Ethereum contract, and Bitmessage clients can query the Ethereum blockchain to get the 34-character Bitmessage address associated with any name behind the scenes. The online anonymizing network Tor suffers from the same problems, and thus can also benefit from this solution.Identity and Reputation Systems - once you can register your name on the blockchain, the logical next step is obvious: have a web of trust on the blockchain. Webs of trust are a key part of an effective peer to peer communication infrastructure: you don't just want to know that a given public key refers to a given person; you also want to know that the person is trustworthy in the first place. The solution is to use social networks: if you trust A, A trusts B, and B trusts C, then there is a pretty good chance that you can trust C, at least to some extent. Ethereum can serve as the data layer for a fully decentralized reputation system - and potentially ultimately a fully decentralized marketplace.Many of the above applications consist of actual peer-to-peer protocols and projects that are already well under development; in those cases, we intend to establish partnerships with as many of these projects as we can, and help fund them in exchange for bringing their value into the Ethereum ecosystem. We want to help not just the cryptocurrency community, but also the peer to peer community as a whole, including file sharing, torrents, data storage and mesh networking. We believe that there are many projects, especially in the non-financial area, that can potentially bring great value to the community, but for which development is underfunded precisely because they lack an opportunity to effectively introduce a financial component; perhaps Ethereum may be what ultimately pushes dozens of these projects to the next stage.Why are all of these applications possible on top of Ethereum? The answer lies in the currency's internal programming language. An analogy here may be made with the internet. Back in 1996, the web was nothing but HTML, and all people could do with it was serve static web pages on sites like Geocities. Then, people decided that there was a great need for people to submit forms in HTML, so HTML added a forms feature. This was like a \"colored coins\" of web protocols: try to solve a specific problem, but do it on top of a weak protocol without looking at the larger picture. Soon, however, we came up with Javascript, a programming language inside the web browser. And it was Javascript that solved the problem: because Javascript is a universal, Turing-complete programming language, it can be used to build apps of arbitrary complexity; Gmail, Facebook and even Bitcoin wallets have all been made with the language. And this was not because the Javascript developers decided that they wanted people to build Gmail, Facebook, and Bitcoin wallets; they just wanted a programming language. What we can do with the language is up to our own imaginations. And that is the spirit that we want to bring to Ethereum. Ethereum does not intend to be the end of all cryptocurrency innovation; it intends to be the beginning.Further InnovationsAlong with its main feature of a Turing-complete, universal scripting language, Ethereum will also have a number of other improvements over existing cryptocurrency:Fees - Ethereum contracts will regulate its Turing-complete functionality and prevent abusive transactions such as memory hogs and infinite loop scripts by instituting a transaction fee for each computational step of script execution. More expensive operations, such as storage accesses and cryptographic operations, will have higher fees, and there will also be a fee for every item of storage that a contract fills up. To encourage contracts to clean up after themselves, if a contract reduces the amount of storage that it uses a negative fee will be charged; in fact, there is a special SUICIDE opcode to clear a contract and send all funds and the hefty negative fee back to its creator.Mining algorithms - there has been a lot of interest into making cryptocurrencies whose mining is resistant against specialized hardware, allowing ordinary users with commodity hardware to participate without any capital investment and helping to avoid centralization. So far, the main antidote has been Scrypt, a mining algorithm that requires a large amount of both computational power and memory to compute; however, Scrypt is not memory-hard enough, and there are companies building specialized devices for it. We have come up with Dagger, a prototype proof of work that is even more memory-hard than Scrypt, as well as prototype proof-of-stake algorithms such as Slasher that get around the issue of mining entirely. Ultimately, however, we intend to host a contest, similar to the contests that determined the standards for AES and SHA3, where we invite research groups from universities around the world to devise the best possible commodity-hardware-friendly possible mining algorithm.GHOST - GHOST is a new block propagation protocol pioneered by Aviv Zohar and Yonatan Sompolinsky that allows blockchains to have much faster block confirmation times, ideally in the range of 3-30 seconds, without running into the issues of centralization and high stale rate that fast block confirmations normally bring. Ethereum is the first major currency to integrate a simplified single-level version of GHOST as part of its protocol.The PlanEthereum is potentially a massive and wide-reaching undertaking, and will take months to develop. With that in mind, the currency will be released in multiple stages. The first stage, the release of the whitepaper, has already happened. Forums, a wiki and a blog have been set up, and anyone is free to visit them and set up an account and comment on the forums. On January 25, a 60-day fundraiser will launch at the confrence in Miami, during which anyone will be able to purchase ether, Ethereum's internal currency, for BTC much like the Mastercoin fundraiser; the price will be 1000 ether for 1 BTC, although early investors will get roughly a 2x benefit to compensate for the increased risk that they're taking for participating in the project earlier. The fundraiser participants will not just get ether; there will also be a number of additional rewards, likely including free tickets to conferences, a spot to put 32 bytes into the genesis block, and for the top donors even the ability to name three sub-units of the currency (eg. the equivalent of the \"microbitcoin\" in BTC).The issuance of Ethereum will not be any single mechanism; instead, a compromise approach combining the benefits of multiple approaches will be used. The issuance model will work as follows:Ether will be released in a fundraiser at the price of 1000-2000 ether per BTC, with earlier funders getting a better price to compensate for the increased uncertainty of participating at an earlier stage. The minimum funding amount will be 0.01 BTC. Suppose that X ether gets released in this way0.225X ether will be allocated to the fiduciary members and early contributors who substantially participated in the project before the start of the fundraiser. This share will be stored in a time-lock contract; about 40 of it will be spendable after one year, 70 after two years and 100 after 3 years.0.05X ether will be allocated to a fund to use to pay expenses and rewards in ether between the start of the fundraiser and the launch of the currency0.225X ether will be allocated as a long-term reserve pool to pay expenses, salaries and rewards in ether after the launch of the currency0.4X ether will be mined per year forever after that pointThere is an important distinction compared to Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies: here, the eventual supply is unlimited. The \"permanent linear inflation\" model is designed to make ether neither inflationary nor deflationary; the lack of a supply cap is intended to dampen some of the speculative and wealth inequality effects of existing currencies, but at the same time the linear, rather than traditionally exponential, inflation model will mean that the effective inflation rate tends to zero over time. Additionally, because the initial currency supply will not start from zero, the currency supply growth in the first eight years will actually be slower than Bitcoin, giving fundraiser participants and early adopters a chance to benefit substantially in the medium term.At some point in February, we will release a centralized testnet - a server which anyone can use to send transactions and create contracts. Soon after that, the decentralized testnet will come, which we will use to test different mining algorithms and make sure that the peer to peer daemon works and is secure, and take measurements to look for optimizations to the scripting language. Finally, once we are sure that the protocol and the client is secure, we will release the genesis block, and allow mining to begin.Looking ForwardSince Ethereum includes a Turing-complete scripting language, it can be mathematically proven that it can do essentially anything that a Bitcoin-like blockchain-based cryptocurrency potentially can do. But there are still problems that the protocol, as it stands today, leaves unresolved. For example, Ethereum offers no solution for the fundamental scalability problem in all blockchain-based cryptocurrencies - namely, the fact that every full node must store the entire balance sheet and verify every transaction. Ethereum's concept of a separate \"state tree\" and \"transaction list\", borrowed from Ripple, mitigates this to some extent, but nevertheless no fundamental breakthrough is mine. For that, technology like Eli ben Sasson's Secure Computational Integrity and Privacy (SCIP), now under development, will be required.Additionally, Ethereum offers no improvements on traditional proof-of-work mining with all its flaws, and proof of excellence and Ripple-style consensus are left unexplored. If it turns out that proof of stake or some other proof of work algorithm is a better solution, then future cryptocurrencies may use proof of stake algorithms like MC2 and Slasher instead. If there is room for an Ethereum 2.0, it is in these areas that it the improvements will lie. And ultimately, Ethereum is an open-ended project; if the project gets enough funding, we may even be the ones to release Ethereum 2.0 ourselves, carrying over the original account balances onto an even further improved network. Ultimately, just as is our slogan for the currency itself, the only limit is our imagination.",

    "text": "The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis recently held a “Dialog with the Fed” on bitcoin basics. The events are “designed to address the key economic and financial issues of the day and to provide the opportunity to ask questions of Fed experts.”The discussions, which began in the fall of 2011, are held at the St. Louis Fed and its branches, and are free and open to the public. All discussions and presentations are archived.While the event was broadcast, video is not up yet. However, the slide deck is, and it’s surprisingly funny and insightful. It goes through some basic elements of bitcoin, a sort of “Explain it to me like I’m 5” for central bankers.Slide 6 describes Bitcoin’s source code size as about 17 MB (500 phonebooks), “About the size of a typical bill coming out of D.C. lately?” And it shows a touch of self-awareness. Under “Common Complaints,” the author writes “We hate banks… and we especially hate central banks.”The deck describes bitcoin as a “Low-cost banking available to anyone in the world,” a “digital cash supply free of political manipulation,” and “a stroke of genius—a monetary system governed by a computer algorithm.”And how funny that the Fed gets the Mt Gox debacle better than most journalists. “The wallets were ‘stolen’ – not Bitcoin’s fault.” Hear, hear.Tackling the issue of “intrinsic value,” which the deck points out bitcoin doesn’t have, one slide asks, “What determines the market exchange rate between two intrinsically useless objects?” Welcome to currency, and life. No value is intrinsic.As for how the Fed will deal with bitcoin, the deck acknowledges that “enforcing an outright ban is close to impossible.” Bitcoin adoption “will force traditional institutions to adapt or die.” And the most promising bit was close to the end, “Well-run central banks should welcome the emerging competition.” Indeed.",

NSF also supports the “Unique, High-Performance Supercomputer Center,” the PRObE Center of Los Alamos, “the world’s first supercomputing system for large-scale systems research” according to another press release from October 24th, 2012. The OIG report does not mention the supercomputer research facilities whose computer resources were misappropriated (nor the name of the professor who did the deed) and we have no reason to believe that either of these facilities were involved in the breach.In fiscal year 2014, NSF’s annual budget is $7.2 billion and the Foundation funds almost a quarter of all federally supported basic research conducted by America’s colleges and universities.Absurdness of Mining Bitcoin Right Now with a SupercomputerIn December 2013, Nathaniel Popper of the New York Times interviewed Michael B. Taylor, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, UCSD Center for Dark Silicon for his article “Into the Bitcoin Mines.” Professor Taylor explained that:“Today, all of the machines dedicated to mining Bitcoin have a computing power about 4,500 times the capacity of the United States government’s mightiest supercomputer, the IBM Sequoia. The computing capacity of the Bitcoin network has grown by around 30,000 percent since the beginning of the year.”We caught up with Professor Taylor who provided an update on these metrics:“Today, all of the machines dedicated to mining Bitcoin have a computing power about 58,600 times the capacity of the United States government’s mightiest supercomputer, the IBM Sequoia…{note: now second most powerful after “Titan” according to Top 500} …The computing capacity of the Bitcoin network has grown by around 1,300 percent since the beginning of the year.”Professor Taylor also happens to be a NSF funded researcher (of no relation to the professor who misappropriated the use of supercomputers to mine for bitcoin). His 2013 research paper “Bitcoin and The Age of Bespoke Silicon” was partially supported by NSF Awards.Professor Taylor said that the “NSF is generally interested in the advancement of science, which includes cryptocurrencies and many other exciting developments in the scientific world.”Indeed, NSF funded (in part) well known research by Nicolas Christin of Carnegie Mellon INI/CyLab, “Traveling the Silk Road: A Measurement Analysis of a Large Anonymous Online Marketplace“ (PDF), University of California and San Diego George Mason University researchers papers “A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names” (PDF) and “Botcoin: Monetizing Stolen Cycles” (Ref: “Using stolen computer processing cycles to mine Bitcoin”) as well as research such as Doctoral Dissertation Research: Making Real Money: Local Currency and Social Economies in the United States” with a stipend of $5,227 which was awarded in 2005 and “NeTs: Small: Economic Incentives for P2P: Theory and Design” awarded in July 2010 with a total of $466,000 awarded towards NeTs to date (and expiring this August).We asked Michael about the “futility” of mining bitcoin with a supercomputer and he told us that:“In a day, Sequoia could mine about 40 dollars worth of bitcoin, but it consumes about the same amount of electricity as 4,000 homes: 8 megawatts. They would pay more money in electricity costs each day than they would earn.”Using a Supercomputer to mine for bitcoin is both appalling and shocking to common sense. That said, we are uncertain of the exact metrics to use to extrapolate the efficiencies (or lack of thereof) of mining for bitcoin during the period in question. However, that won’t stop us from trying to second guess the scant data provided by the OIG report (FOIA request anyone?).The only computers designed to efficiently mine for bitcoin are ASIC or Application-Specific Integrated Circuit “mining rigs” (a.k.a computers). One such rig produced by KnCMiner costs approximately $6,000 and “minimum 3000GH/s of hashing speed that 3TH.” Eric Turner, founder of CoinChomp estimates that Neptune should consume 4,500 Watts. The current price tag for the IBM Sequoia supercomputer cost close $250 million dollars. To create its electricity, cost is estimated at $9 million a year or about $24,655 per day according to Steve Henn at NPR.It is likely the $150,000 mentioned in the OIG report as “NSF-supported computer usage” was the electrical cost of mining on the supercomputer or potentially mining for 6 full days.While mining on hardware designed for processing Bitcoin transactions is the most efficient way to mine Bitcoin, the supercomputer was most likely chosen for its availability and the electrical costs were not paid by the miner. The only steps necessary to mine Bitcoin are installing software designed to process SHA-256 hashes and configuring that software to mine on a specific mining pool.There may have been additional measures taken to hide login access to the computer, but it would have been difficult to hide the supercomputer’s power consumption while mining for Bitcoins.History Repeats ItselfThis may or may not have been the first time a supercomputer was misused to mine for Cryptocurrency. Theodore R. Delwiche reported on February 20, 2014 in The Harvard Crimson that “Harvard Research Computing Resources Misused for ‘Dogecoin’ Mining Operation:”“A member of the Harvard community was stripped of his or her access to the University’s research computing facilities last week after setting up a “dogecoin” mining operation using a Harvard research network, according to an internal email circulated by Faculty of Arts and Sciences Research Computing officials.”One of the earliest references we could find for the misappropriation of computer time was an interesting case from 1967. According to Paul Andrews, in his 1994 biography “Gates: How Microsoft’s Mogul Reinvented an Industry–and Made Himself the Richest Man in America,” a “runty freckle-faced eighth grader” known by the name of Bill Gates punked C-Cubed computer company while learning the computer programming language BASIC. Gates and his fellow students had become “addicted to programming.” Even though Gates received a 20 percent educational discount, computer “time sharing” costs became too costly. “Real people had to pay for computing time” but “Accessing the accounting files, where the passwords were stored, seemed like just another challenge…Bill Gates and his friend Paul Allen were clearly the ringleaders.” Andrews wryly explains “The kids were testing the system, just doing a little digital shoplifting. What harm was there in appropriating unused computer time protected with only the flimsiest of barriers?”While Bill, Paul and company were banned from the computers for the summer, it’s not known if our present day Bitcoin pirate was technically “debarred” under the “Office of Federal Contract Compliance.” The OIG has a section of the report which discusses “Total Accountability: Suspension, Debarment and Beyond” and mentions debarments in “Civil and Criminal Investigations” and “Research Misconduct Investigations.” Our computing power thief is not one of them as this was listed as an “Administrative Investigation” none of which involved a debarment. According to the report, NSF “suspended” the researcher “government-wide.” The suspension is assumed to be indefinite as there was no time-frame provided.If he only used his brain, he would have never gotten into this mess!Full Extract from the National Science FoundationOffice of the Inspector General March 2014 Semi Annual Report to Congress:Government-wide Suspension Recommended for Researcher Who Used NSF-Funded Supercomputers to Mine BitcoinsWe received reports describing a researcher’s abuse of NSF-funded supercomputing resources at two universities to conduct bitcoin mining activities. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that is independent of national currencies, but it can be converted into traditional currencies through exchange markets. It is generated or “mined” through a process that is by design computationally intensive.The researcher misused over $150,000 in NSF-supported computer usage at two universities to generate bitcoins valued between $8,000 and $10,000. Both universities determined that this was an unauthorized use of their IT systems. The researcher asserted that he was conducting tests on the computers, but neither university had authorized him to conduct such tests — both university reports noted that the researcher accessed the computer systems remotely and may have taken steps to conceal his activities, including accessing one supercomputer through a mirror site in Europe.The researcher’s access to all NSF-funded supercomputer resources was terminated. In response to our recommendation, NSF suspended the researcher government-wide.Image (altered) via Wikipedia",

    "text": "HunterCoin (HUC) is a fork from Namecoin and was the brainchild of user SnailBrain and the late user thecoder who helped make Namecoin.The concept behind HUC is that mining can do more than secure a network or place votes on valid transactions. HUC mining helps people play a game.In HUC SHA256 and Scrypt miners can help users register unique names against the HUC blockchain and register the players’ position on the GUI that all users share.A user registers their name and gets 2 extra characters. The main character, or general, has its name appended with a .1, and the other characters get a .2 and .3 appended. To create characters, you must spend HUC. When you create your character, you get to choose what team you would like to play for. There are red, blue, green, and yellow teams to choose from.The HUC wallet is also where you play the game. When you load the game you’ll see a very large scrollable map where you can watch other teams move around. Miners validate names and positions, but the mining algorithm is designed to release most of the coins mined back onto the game board. You can literally click on the screen to nearby or far away locations and collect all the HUC you’d like.The catch is every player has the ability to turn themselves into a walking nuke. Clicking destroy as your action, instead of moving around the board or returning to your base, kills all players in your vicinity and the coins they are holding are released for the HUC players to fight over.One objective besides getting coins is obtaining a crown. If a user has this crown in their possession they will earn .25 HUC while they are still alive.There is also a chat window where you can shout threats and taunts, and declare, “Go!” Even though sending the message “Go!” does absolutely nothing, it is part of the madness and absurdity that comes with MMO gaming.Due to the open source nature of the game, their chat window has been declared NSFW and the game isn’t recommended for children.When I first played the game, it was pretty responsive; even though having a player move took longer than a traditional MMORPG, I didn’t mind waiting. As of a few months ago, the amount of players trying to mine, move, and kill is quite high and is the cause of any lag in game play.Because you need HUC to actually play, please post your HUC addresses as comments to this post so folks from the HUC community can share coins with new users.Related Links:HunterCoin main site: http://huntercoin.orgHunterCoin client download: http://huntercoin.org/downloadsLive HunterCoin site with stats: http://huntercoin.info/HunterCoin announcement: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=300538.0HunterCoin github: https://github.com/chronokings/huntercoin",

    "text": "My friend John Scianna, an active participant in the bitcoin community (and writer for Bitcoin Magazine), is working to attend Draper University and needs our help to fund his endeavor.He told me about his plan, and other than donating a few satoshis, I didn't know how I could be of service to this fellow bitcoiner. Then I had a lightbulb moment: I'll write about it.While putting together the questions below for John to anwswer, I realized how important it is for us as a community to support each other - because if we don't, who will? Donation info is at the bottom of the page.1. What is Draper University and why do you think you'd be good for it?Draper University is an entrepreneurship program, it’s in San Mateo, California and was started by the “free-spirited” venture capitalist Tim Draper. It covers everything you would find in an accelerated MBA program for entrepreneurship. The program is quite unique, it’s in the historic Benjamin Franklin Hotel where students and startup founders live. You literally eat, sleep and breathe among entrepreneurs seven days a week for seven weeks.I believe I will be perfect for Draper University, because this is something I have always wanted to do. I have dreamed about going to California and working in the technology space ever since I was little. My favorite song is even “Going to California” by Led Zeppelin, I think the culture out there just suits me best. Draper U is becoming increasingly Bitcoin focused now that Tim bought 29,658 bitcoins. Tim’s son Adam also has an accelerator program, Boost, in which about one-third of the startups are bitcoin related.2. What is your professional background?My professional background ranges from agricultural sciences to financial services. I have worked at the University of Florida’s Tropical Research and Educational Center where I did plant tissue culture on tropical plants and took part in a study on jatropha curcas, a plant that makes biodiesel. I have also interned for the USDA where I did research on consumer preferences of tropical fruit and I got to go to the USDA’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. to present my research.On-campus I focused on developing my marketing expertise. Freshman year I was a part UF’s Multicultural & Diversity Affairs, where I was the External Marketing Director. My responsibilities included promotion, partnering with other organizations, event planning and hospitality services at MCDA’s Institute of Hispanic-Latino Services.This past year, I was the Community Outreach Director for UF’s Nourish International. In Nourish we have small business ventures on-campus to raise money for sustainable development projects. This year it was for a project in Uganda to help send AIDS orphans to school. We would do ventures like sell bows on game day and donuts in the morning. It really taught me how to put myself out there and sell, plus everything went to a good cause.What was even harder than selling bows, was trying to sell life insurance and other financial products when I was at Northwestern Mutual. I think that was the hardest job I have ever had. I would cold-call people all day hoping to get a meeting or two, it was tough, but it definitely taught me how to be persistent and to overcome failure.It wasn’t until my first Bitcoin conference that I became a journalist in the field. I have always liked voicing my opinion and I saw it as a great way to meet interesting people. I had learned all about bitcoin through mining, it really speeds up the learning curve when you dive into something that technical; so, I had enough knowledge to write on the subject and went right into it.3.What are you currently busy with?Like most in this community, I am busy with Bitcoin. I am an intern for the Chamber of Digital Commerce and I work closely with Perianne Boring. This past week we spent our time calling the offices of congressmen and women scheduling meetings with them for the inaugural Congressional Bitcoin Education Day. I think this is a great way to inform our leaders of the great promises of Bitcoin, no matter what your political views are; regulation affects us all. If we choose to do nothing we will ultimately lose, so by doing this we can educate politicians about the benefits of bitcoin and dismiss all the negative propaganda that Bitcoin has faced in the past. My work with Perianne mostly focuses on education and addressing public policy issues like New York’s BitLicense.In addition to that I also write for a few Bitcoin media outlets, and I have been working on a tea startup, teatoshi, that my co-founder and I plan to launch soon.4. What do you wish to get out of Draper University?The most valuable thing I wish to get out of Draper University is the connections with other entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. I think this is the most valuable aspect of the residential experience. Draper University has an online course, but you won’t get the same benefits as being there.I think going to the residential program is important because entrepreneurs and venture capitalists share a synergistic relationship; there are so many ideas out in the world but without venture capitalists many [of] these projects wouldn’t be able to get off the ground or scale. You can create an app or e-service from space, but there won’t be any venture capitalists there; this is why you find so many entrepreneurs moving out to the Valley.Hopefully, once I graduate from DU I can be apart of Tim’s or Adam’s incubator programs - that way I can stay in California and get my ideas out my head and into the world.5. How can the bitcoin community help you?The community can help by donating whatever spare bits they have in their wallet so I can cover the expenses of the program or simply by sharing this article. You can introduce me to someone who might be able to help or if you are a company you can sponsor me. I will wear your company gear, I will even shave my head if you want me to, all I really care about is being able to go.You can donate in Bitcoin or Fiat, but I actually prefer bitcoin because gofundme charges about 8 and you can track the funds to Draper U’s address.BTC: 1KfpoCwWcAbyxdiwqGvWtKcdGwcLhB4zuKFiat: http://www.gofundme.com/johnscianna ",

    "text": "While on the web not too long ago, I found a website called Wheel of Doge. It’s a Dogecoin betting game.I had some extra Dogecoin lying around, so I decided to give it a shot. Why not?The first thing I noticed on the website was that the user interface was visually appealing, colorful, and engaging – It drew me in. After quickly getting the hang of the game, the adventure began. What ensued was a roller coaster of wins and losses, but and overall exhilarating experience.Click. Spin. Win Doge.Click Spin. Lose Doge. :[Click Spin. Win Again.After every click, happy barks and sad whimpers were emitted from my computer speaker. The happy barks made me want to emerge as The Doge Champion. The sad whimpers made me want to do the same.Now, I’m very aware that excessive gambling is a serious disease, and that it can potentially destroy lives. But it’s so fun! Seriously, watch out kids. When you’re in the zone, crazy things can happen. Most of the time, you lose track of time and money.After what seemed like 5 minutes of playing, I realized that an hour had flew by. After being taken on this ride, I began to wonder how it happened.What was it about Wheel of Doge that kept me clicking and playing?I contacted the creators of The Wheel of Doge, and found out the answer: Wheel of Doge was created by expert game developers and designers.The head developer at Wheel of Doge, Jake, notes:“Dogecoin has come very far. But the aesthetics are still sorely lacking in the Dogecoin space. We wanted to fix that. We love games and we love design … We wanted to represent Dogecoin with something elegant and simple … A game the community would enjoy and be proud of. I believe we’ve done that.”After I finished playing, the Dogecoin withdrawal was quick. Another thing I liked about the game was that I left the site and returned, and my Doge balance remained on the site.I asked the team about what led to the creation of the game; here’s what they had to say:“We looked at the Dogecoin betting games available. We saw nothing particularly good. There was no attention to aesthetics and no respect for the Dogecoin brand. We love games and we love design. We wanted to represent Dogecoin with something elegant and simple; a game the community would enjoy and be proud of. We’re coming out of beta and we’re busy adding the features the community asked for. Specifically, for functionality, we have added an auto-spin. A lot of people asked for that, so we built it. Also, to allow our players to benefit from the success of the game, we’ve built a really easy to use affiliate program and ‘Be The Bank’ feature.”Wheel of Doge is hoping to be the leading game in the Dogecoin space by providing many fun and much Dogecoin for their supporters.Check it out here.",

    "text": "Bitcoin is gaining popularity. Although the price has declined, people are still asking about and joining the ‘mining frenzy’ with increasingly capable hardware. In fact, the current aggregate hashrate of the Bitcoin network is topping a staggering >200,000,000 GH/s.Remember that the profitability of mining depends on not only the necessary investment in hardware, but, most importantly, in the recurring cost of the energy required to power mining rigs.The world is full of people who are willing to game any system for an expected personal profit. Unsurprisingly, there is a trend of individuals engaging in what is called ‘illicit bitcoin mining’, which is, essentially, borrowing computing resources and stealing power to mine for bitcoin.There are known cases of malware authors who install hidden miners in unsuspecting Internet-using computers all around the globe (see here and here).Other individuals steal power or computing resources from their employers (see here and here).How do we solve this problem?The ultimate way to thwart illicit bitcoin mining in corporate infrastructures is by accounting for power consumption. However, Barcelona-based startup Network Polygraph offers a cloud-based network monitoring solution, which could offer an alternative solution.Josep Sanjuas, CEO of the company that commercializes Network Polygraph, states: “Rather than focusing on power consumption, pooled bitcoin mining can be detected by checking for certain patterns in network traffic.”Network Polygraph provides network visibility, which helps network managers understand what is happening in their network in order to better manage it. For example, it produces bandwidth usage charts, flags the IP addresses that generate most traffic, and detects network-based attacks.As part of its core features, Network Polygraph determines which applications have generated network traffic by using complex machine-learning based methods. Its creators have recently incorporated Bitcoin mining detection to their product and it is already reporting illicit mining activities in customer networks.“We were surprised when Network Polygraph started flagging mining activities in our customers’ networks,” explains Sanjuas. “We expected we would catch some bitcoin-related activity, but we ended up uncovering an illicit Bitcoin miner that had been operating for months,” he continues to explain.“We are not allowed to disclose much about these cases for obvious reasons, but we expect illicit mining to become a greater problem as bitcoin keeps becoming more mainstream.”Sanjuas explains that “to our best knowledge, [Network Polygraph] is the first network visibility product that features bitcoin mining detection.” He clarifies that bitcoin mining detection is not the main selling point of Network Polygraph’s product line, but “just another way [the company] can justify its cost, besides regular usage for network operations, troubleshooting or capacity planning.”It is important to note that Network Polygraph supports bitcoin usage, and promises to “work out a solution” if customers wish to pay in bitcoin for their services.For more information on Network Polygraph or to explore their business in more depth, please visit https://polygraph.io.",

    "text": "The technology of Scrypt mining ASICs has exploded in the past year and many believe that 2014 will be the year for mining scrypt based currencies like Litecoin, Dogecoin and Auroracoin. For a company like Bliss Devices, these advancements are providing individuals with innovative chips, faster hashing and lower cost of ownership. In fact, Bliss Devices has just announced what may be the highest performing Scrypt ASIC chip to date.Bliss Devices was founded by Paul Chen and Steve Zhang, who were integral in the creation of 8 highly-complex ASICs at Fortinet, a global provider of network security appliances and unified threat management. Their background in the creation of high-tech ASICs and experience in network security and semiconductors have been pivotal to Bliss’ initial success and continued product development. Their newest endeavor is the Scryptr Mining Chip.According to the company, initial testing has outperformed its original targets and has achieved the best power-to-performance ratio of any chip on the market, with a lower cost of acquisition per chip. For many miners in the industry, cost of ownership is most commonly the biggest barrier to entry, in addition to energy consumption. This is also one of the first times that a delivery date has been moved up rather than held back. Many Bitcoin miners experienced this in the early days of mining rigs, ordering rigs and ASICs that were either on backorder or not available until much later, which by that time ended up being obsolete.However, it seems that Bliss Devices has come up with a product that has surpassed even their own expectations. “Our goal was to significantly improve upon the designs available today and push the limits of today’s advanced technologies, bringing the industrial mining market a solution that exceeds the expanding demands for both Scrypt-based and altcoin mining,” Co-Founder and CEO Paul Chen expressed in a recent press release.Testing of the company’s newest scrypt ASIC chip began weeks ago and delivered very high performance metrics. Initial testing of the new Scryptr Mining Chip yielded a hash rate between 4.5 MH/s and 4.8 MH/s, while only requiring 18W of power per chip. The company will offer both a standalone Scryptr chip and Neon Mining Cards that each contain 8 Scryptr chips providing a total of 37 MH/s of hashing power. The devices have a variety of interface options including PCIe/PCI, SPI, or USB, which will be scalable to 127 cards on a single USB backplane. When mounted on a Neon Mining Card, the Scryptr consumes an industry low for power consumption of 4.5W per MH/s, giving it one of the lowest power-to-consumption ratios in the scrypt mining industry.Today’s miners are constantly on the hunt for hashrate, but this often comes at a price. Industrial miners want the most cost effective mining equipment that has the highest ROI, and if it breaks the bank initially, they believe the performance will far outweigh the cost. Miners evaluate this ROI by taking a look at three main metrics: the price of hashing power, the cost to run it and the ship date. Abram Kottmeier, Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Bliss Devices said, “Miners want to know much hashing power they can buy and what the total cost of ownership will be. I think miners will be blown away when they see the results of our FPGA (field-programmable gate array) prototyping tests.”The full test setup and report, including a video of the testing, can be found at http://blissdevices.com/key-milestone-successful-fgpa-demo/The Neon Mining Card could be the new benchmark for Scrypt mining and by providing cards with flexible interface options, Bliss Devices is providing differentiated solutions for miners to optimize their operations. The company can also provide solutions for mining projects of all sizes, with custom system designs which include Neon Mining Cards and their hardware development kit. For the company’s newest endeavor, Bliss Devices has expedited the availability of both Neon Mining Cards and the Scryptr chip from October 2014 to August 2014. Keep on the look out for some high powered and cost-effective scrypt miners to be coming out of California in the very near future.",

    "text": "When the crypto community thinks of altcoin, cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Peercoin are usually first on their mind. We have seen a growing number of altcoin since Bitcoin’s introduction in 2009, simply because of the rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies all over the world. But is it possible to have an alternative altcoin? The new and innovative altcoin NXT and its developers have made it possible.Less than a month ago, NXT launched their brand new digital currency, and soon after signed BTER as an exchange partner. With no mining on the network, NXT is the most energy efficient cryptocurrency, because the “forging” process requires little processing power. Forging NXT can even be done from a mobile device.The new Alt-Altcoin?The way NXT works is completely different from that of Bitcoin as it uses completely different algorithms for mining. In fact, the developers created NXT completely from scratch, in order to create the new alt-altcoin. The different algorithms used allow NXT users to mine with exponentially less computing power. NXT uses Proof of Stake (PoS), a concept initially pioneered by Peercoin, rather than Proof of Work, used by Bitcoin and other coins.NXT and Proof of StakeAs the first 100 Proof of Stake digital currency written from the ground-up, NXT is creating a new path on which altcoins can be built from. Unlike Proof of Work currencies like Bitcoin, the currency is secured by owners of already existing coins that receive a portion of transaction fees for forging a NXT block. A user is chosen to solve a block depending on their stake in the market, which allows everyone on the network to have the same reward potential.The idea behind NXT and Proof of Stake is to generate coins without using vast amounts of energy as the Bitcoin network does. This is done through the network, by calculating the amount of coins each user has and randomly selecting who will forge the next block. Everyone knows who will be mining the next block in the blockchain, making it impossible for a user to convince the network that a transaction didn’t occur.Additionally, the network can detect which accounts do not participate in PoS and also recognize users forging a fraudulent block. A process called Transparent Forging enables the network to decrease the attacker’s mining power to zero and keep the NXT network secure.Reducing Double Spending and 51 AttacksNXT eliminates the possibility of double spending and 51 attacks, because each user knows who is responsible for forging the next block of transactions. A fork in the blockchain simply does not exist with the newest alt-altcoin. What Transparent Forging and PoS provides to NXT is something new for cryptocurrencies. Transactions continue to remain anonymous and secure, but unlike Bitcoin, each transaction requires less user confirmation, making digital transactions even more efficient.NXT is the first cryptocurrency that has been completely rewritten and is 100 Proof of Stake. Other altcoins like Peercoin, only uses PoS for a portion of its coins and uses Proof of Work for the rest. Digital currencies, most namely Bitcoin, along with other altcoins like Peercoin use mining to create new coins, working together to solve each block. This is the main point of difference with NXT - instead of mining new coins, NXT has already produced them. This enables the NXT network to focus on solving blocks and increase transaction efficiency, while decreasing power consumption for users.What’s Next for NXT?As with any alternative coin, NXT is very new to the cryptocurrency community. The entire market consists of 1 billion coins, all created by the NXT developers, and are currently worth just under $74,000,000USD. NXT also provides an alias system, arbitrary messaging at Block 40,000, asset exchange and a decentralized domain name system. There is no question that NXT warrants its own category, as the world’s first alt-altcoin entirely based on Proof of Stake. With the growing popularity of cryptocurrency, the future looks very bright for NXT.",

The security assumption that a nineteen-year-old in Hangzhou and someone who is maybe in the UK and maybe not have not yet decided to collude with each other.There has been a large amount of ruckus in the past week about the issue of mining centralization in the Bitcoin network. We saw a single mining pool, GHash.io, amass over 45 hashpower for many hours, and at one point even grow to become 51 of the entire network. The entire front page of the Bitcoin reddit was ablaze in intense discussion and a rare clash of complacency and fear, miners quickly mobilized to take their hashpower off GHash, and surprisingly clever strategies were used in an attempt to bring back the balance between the different pools, up to and including one miner with “between 50 TH/s and 2 PH/s” mining at GHash but refusing to forward valid blocks, essentially sabotating all mines on the pool to the extent of up to 4. Now, the situation has somewhat subsided, with GHash down to 35 network hashpower and the runner up, Discus Fish, up to 16, and it is likely that the situation will remain that way for at least a short while before things heat up again. Is the problem solved? Of course not. Can the problem be solved? That will be the primary subject of this post.Bitcoin MiningFirst of all, let us understand the problem. The purpose of Bitcoin mining is to create a decentralized timestamping system, using what is essentially a majority vote mechanism to determine in which order certain transactions came as a way of solving the double-spending problem. The double-spending problem is simple to explain: if I send a transaction sending my 100 BTC to you, and then one day later I send a transaction sending the same 100 BTC to myself, both of those transactions obviously cannot simultaneously process. Hence, one of the two has to “win”, and the intuitively correct transaction that should get that honor is the one that came first. However, there is no way to look at a transaction and cryptographically determine when it was created. This is where Bitcoin mining steps in.Bitcoin mining works by having nodes called “miners” aggregate recent transactions and produce packages called “blocks”. For a block to be valid, all of the transactions it contains must be valid, it must “point to” (ie. contain the hash of) a previous block that is valid, and it must satisfy “the proof of work condition” (namely, SHA2562(block_header) <= 2190, ie. the double-hash of the block header must start with a large number of zeroes). Because SHA256 is a pseudorandom function, the only way to make such blocks is to repeatedly attempt to produce them until one happens to satisfy the condition. The 2190“target” is a flexible parameter; it auto-adjusts so that on average the entire network needs to work for ten minutes before one node gets lucky and succeeds; once that happens, the newly produced block becomes the “latest” block, and everyone starts trying to mine a block pointing to that block as the previous block. This process, repeating once every ten minutes, constitutes the primary operation of the Bitcoin network, creating an ever-lengthening chain of blocks (“blockchain”) containing, in order, all of the transactions that have ever taken place.If a node sees two or more competing chains, it deems the one that is longest, ie. the one that has the most proof-of-work behind it, to be valid. Over time, if two or more chains are simultaneously at play, one can see how the chain with more computational power backing it is eventually guaranteed to win; hence, the system can be described as “one CPU cycle, one vote”. But there is one vulnerability: if one party, or one colluding group of parties, has over 50 of all network power, then that entity alone has majority control over the voting process and can out-compute any other chain. This gives this entity some privileges:The entity can only acknowledge blocks produced by itself as valid, preventing anyone else from mining because its own chain will always be the longest. Over time, this doubles the miner’s BTC-denominated revenue at everyone else’s expense. Note that a weak version of this attack, “selfish-mining“, starts to become effective at around 25 network power.The entity can refuse to include certain transactions (ie. censorship)The entity can “go back in time” and start mining from N blocks ago. When this fork inevitably overtakes the original, this removes the effect of any transactions that happened in the original chain after the forking point. This can be used to earn an illicit profit by (1) sending BTC to an exchange, (2) waiting 6 blocks for the deposit to be confirmed, (3) purchasing and withdrawing LTC, (4) reversing the deposit transaction and instead sending those coins back to the attacker.This is the dreaded “51 attack”. Notably, however, even 99 hashpower does not give the attacker the privilege of assigning themselves an arbitrary number of new coins or stealing anyone else’s coins (except by reversing transactions). Another important point is that 51 of the network is not needed to launch such attacks; if all you want is to defraud a merchant who accepts transactions after waiting N confirmations (usually,N = 3 or N = 6If your mining pool has portion P of the network you can succeed with probability: (P / (1-P))^Nat 35 hashpower and 3 confirmations, this means that GHash can currently steal altcoins from an altcoin exchange with 15.6 success probability – once in every six tries.PoolsHere is we get to pools. Bitcoin mining is a rewarding but, unfortunately, very high-variance activity. If, in the current 100 PH/s network, you are running an ASIC with 1 TH/s, then every block you have a chance of 1 in 100000 of receiving the block reward of 25 BTC, but the other 99999 times out of 100000 you get exactly nothing. Given that network hashpower is currently doubling every three months (for simplicity, say 12500 blocks), that gives you a probability of 15.9 that your ASIC will ever generate a reward, and a 84.1 chance that the ASIC’s total lifetime earnings will be exactly nothing.A mining pool acts as a sort of inverse insurance agent: the mining pool asks you to mine into its own address instead of yours, and if you generate a block whose proof of work is almost good enough but not quite, called a “share”, then the pool gives you a smaller payment. For example, if the mining difficulty for the main chain requires the hash to be less than 2190, then the requirement for a share might be 2190. Hence, in this case, you will generate a share roughly every hundred blocks, receiving 0.024 BTC from the pool, and one time in a thousand out of those the mining pool will receive a reward of 25 BTC. The difference between the expected 0.00024 BTC and 0.00025 BTC per block is the mining pool’s profit.However, mining pools also serve another purpose. Right now, most mining ASICs are powerful at hashing, but surprisingly weak at everything else; the only thing they often have for general computation is a small Raspberry Pi, far too weak to download and validate the entire blockchain. Miners could fix this, at the cost of something like an extra $100 per device for a more decent CPU, but they do not – for the obvious reason that $0 is less than $100. Instead, they ask mining pools to generate mining data for them. The “mining data” in question refers to the block header, a few hundred bytes of data containing the hash of the previous block, the root of a Merkle tree containing transactions, the timestamp and some other ancillary data. Miners take this data, and continue incrementing a value called a “nonce” until the block header satisfies the proof-of-work condition. Ordinarily, miners would take this data from the block that they independently determine to be the latest block; here, however, the actual selection of what the latest block is is being relegated to the pools.Thus, what do we have? Well, right now, essentially this:The mining ecosystem has solidified into a relatively small number of pools, and each one has a substantial portion of the network – and, of course, last week one of those pools, GHash, reached 51. Given that every time any mining pool, whether Deepbit in 2011 or GHash in 2013, reached 51 there has been a sudden massive reduction in the number of users, it is entirely possible that GHash actually got anywhere up to 60 network hashpower, and is simply hiding some of it. There is plenty of evidence in the real world of large corporations creating supposedly mutually competing brands to give the appearance of choice and market dynamism, so such a hypothesis should not at all be discounted. Even assuming that GHash is in fact being honest about the level of hashpower that it has, what this chart literally says is that the only reason why there are not 51 attacks happening against Bitcoin right now is that Discus Fish, a mining pool run by a nineteen-year-old in Hangzhou, China, and GHash, a mining pool run supposedly in the UK but may well be anywhere, have not yet decided to collude with each other and take over the blockchain. Alternatively, if one is inclined to trust this particular nineteen-year-old in Hangzhou (after all, he seemed quite nice when I met him), Eligius or BTCGuild can collude with GHash instead.So what if, for the sake of example, GHash gets over 51 again and starts launching 51 attacks (or, perhaps, even starts launching attacks against altcoin exchanges at 40)? What happens then?First of all, let us get one bad argument out of the way. Some argue that it does not matter if GHash gets over 51, because there is no incentive for them to perform attacks against the network since even one such attack would destroy the value of their own currency units and mining hardware. Unfortunately, this argument is simply absurd. To see why, consider a hypothetical currency where the mining algorithm is simply a signature verifier for my own public key. Only I can sign blocks, and I have every incentive to maintain trust in the system. Why would the Bitcoin community not adopt my clearly superior, non-electricity-wasteful, proof of work? There are many answers: I might be irrational, I might get coerced by a government, I might start slowly inculcating a culture where transaction reversals for certain “good purposes” (eg. blocking child pornography payments) are acceptable and then slowly expand that to cover all of my moral prejudices, or I might even have a massive short against Bitcoin at 10x leverage. Those middle two arguments are not crazy hypotheticals; they are real-world documented actions of the implemenation of me-coin that already exists: PayPal. This is why decentralization matters; we do not burn millions of dollars of electricity per year just to move to a currency whose continued stability hinges on simply a slightly different kind of political game.Additionally, it is important to note that even GHash itself has a history of involvement in using transaction reversal attacks against gambling sites; specifically, one may recall the episode involving BetCoin Dice. Of course, GHash denies that it took any deliberate action, and is probably correct; rather, the attacks seem to be the fault of a rogue employee. However, this is not an argument in favor of GHash; much the opposite, it is a piece of real-world empirical evidence showing a common argument in favor of decentralization: power corrupts, and equally importantly power attracts those who are already corrupt. Theoretically, GHash has increased security since then; in practice, no matter what they do this central point of vulnerability for the Bitcoin network still exists.However, there is another, better, argument for why mining pools are not an issue: namely, precisely the fact that they are not individual miners, but rather pools from which miners can enter and leave at any time. Because of this, one can reasonably say that Ars Technica’s claim that Bitcoin’s security has been “shattered by an anonymous miner with 51 network power” is completely inaccurate; there is no one miner that controls anything close to 51. There is indeed a single entity, called CEX.io, that controls 25 of GHash, which is scary in itself but nevertheless far from the scenario that the headline is insinuating is the case. If individuals miners do not want to participate in subverting the Bitcoin protocol and inevitably knocking the value of their coins down by something like 70, they can simply leave the pool, and such a thing has now happened three times in Bitcoin’s history. However, the question is, as the Bitcoin economy continues to professionalize, will this continue to be the case? Or, given somewhat more “greedy” individuals, will the miners keep on mining at the only pool that lets them continue earning revenue, individually saving their own profits at the cost of taking the entire Bitcoin mining ecosystem collectively down a cliff?SolutionsEven now, there is actually one strategy that miners can, and have, taken to subvert GHash.io: mining on the pool but deliberately withholding any blocks they find that are actually valid. Such a strategy is undetectable, but with a 1 PH/s miner mining in this way it essentially reduces the profits of all GHash miners by about 2.5. This sort of pool sabotage completely negates the benefit of using the zero-fee GHash over other pools. This ability to punish bad actors is interesting, though its implications are unclear; what if GHash starts hiring miners to do the same against every other pool? Thus, rather than relying on vigilante sabotage tactics with an unexamined economic endgame, we should ideally try to look for other solutions.First of all, there is the ever-present P2P mining pool, P2Pool. P2Pool has been around for years, and works by having its own internal blockchain with a 10-second block time, allowing miners to submit shares as blocks in the chain and requiring miners to attempt to produce blocks sending to all of the last few dozen share producers at the same time. If P2Pool had 90 network hashpower, the result would not be centralization and benevolent dictatorship; rather, the limiting case would simply be a replica of the plain old Bitcoin blockchain. However, P2Pool has a problem: it requires miners to be fully validating nodes. As described above, given the possibility of mining without being a fully validating node this is unacceptable.One solution to this problem is to have a mining algorithm that forces nodes to store the entire blockchain locally. A simple algorithm for this in Bitcoin’s case is:def mine(block_header, N, nonce):\n o = []\n for i in range(20): \n o.append(sha256(block_header + nonce + i))\n n = []\n for i in range(20): \n B = (o[i] / 2**128) % N\n n.append(tx(B, o[i]))\n return sha256(block_header + str(n))Where tx(B, k) is a function that returns the kth transaction in block B, wrapping around modulo the number of transactions in that block if necessary, and N is the current block number. Note that this is a simple algorithm and is highly suboptimal; some obvious optimizations include making it serial (ie. oundefined depends on nundefined), building a Merkle tree out of the oundefined values to allow them to be individually verified, and maintaining two Merkle trees in each block, one storing transactions and the other storing all current balances, so the algorithm only needs to query the current block.This approach actually solves two problems at the same time. First, it removes the incentive to use a centralized pool instead of P2Pool. Second, there is an ongoing crisis in Bitcoin about how there are too few full nodes; the reason why this is the case is that maintaining a full node with its 20GB blockchain is expensive, and no one wants to do it. With this scheme, every single mining ASIC would be forced to store the entire blockchain, a state from which performing all of the functions of a full node becomes trivial.A second strategy is another cryptographic trick: make mining non-outsourceable. Specifically, the idea is to create a mining algorithm such that, when a miner creates a valid block, they always necessarily have an alternative way of publishing the block that secures the mining reward for themselves. The strategy is to use a cryptographic construction called a zero-knowledge proof, cryptographically proving that they created a valid block but keeping the block data secret, and then simultaneously create a block without proof of work that sends the reward to the miner. This would make it trivial to defraud a mining pool, making mining pools non-viable.Such a setup would require a substantial change to Bitcoin’s mining algorithm, and uses cryptographic primitives far more advanced than those in the rest of Bitcoin; arguably, complexity is in itself a serious disadvantage, and one that is perhaps worth it to solve serious problems like scalability but not to implement a clever trick to discourage mining pools. Additionally, making mining pools impossible will arguably make the problem worse, not better. The reason why mining pools exist is to deal with the problem of variance; miners are not willing to purchase an investment which has only a 15 chance of earning any return. If the possibility of pooling is impossible, the mining economy will simply centralize into a smaller set of larger players – a setup which, unlike now, individual participants cannot simply switch away from. The previous scheme, on the other hand, still allows pooling as long as the local node has the full blockchain, and thereby encourages a kind of pooling (namely, p2pool) that is not systemically harmful.Another approach is less radical: don’t change the mining algorithm at all, but change the pooling algorithms. Right now, most mining pools use a payout scheme called “pay-per-last-N-shares” (PPLNS) – pay miners per share an amount based on the revenue received from the last few thousand shares. This algorithm essentially splits the pool’s own variance among its users, resulting in no risk for the pool and a small amount of variance for the users (eg. using a pool with 1 hashpower, the expected standard deviation of monthly returns is ~15, far better than the solo mining lottery but still non-negligible). Larger pools have less variance, because they mine more blocks (by basic statistics, a pool with 4x more mining power has a 2x smaller standard deviation as a percentage). There is another scheme, called PPS (pay-per-share), where a mining pool simply pays a static amount per share to miners; this scheme removes all variance from miners, but at the cost of introducing risk to the pool; that is why no mining pool does it.Meni Rosenfeld’s Multi-PPS attempts to provide a solution. Instead of mining into one pool, miners can attempt to produce blocks which pay to many pools simultaneously (eg. 5 BTC to one pool, 7 BTC to another, 11.5 BTC to a third and 1.5 BTC to a fourth), and the pools will pay the miner for shares proportionately (eg. instead of one pool paying 0.024 BTC per share, the first pool will pay 0.0048, the second 0.00672, the third 0.01104 and the fourth 0.00144). This allows very small pools to only accept miners giving them very small rewards, allowing them to take on a level of risk proportionate to their economic capabilities. For example, if pool A is 10x bigger than pool B, then pool A might accept blocks with outputs to them up to 10 BTC, and pool B might only accept 1 BTC. If one does the calculations, one can see that the expected return for pool B is exactly ten times what pool A gets in every circumstance, so pool B has no special superlinear advantage. In a single-PPS scenario, on the other hand, the smaller B would face 3.16x higher risk compared to its wealth.The problem is, to what extent is the problem really because of variance, and to what extent is it something else, like convenience? Sure, a 1 mining pool will see a 15 monthly standard deviation in its returns. However, all mining pools see something like a 40 monthly standard deviation in their returns simply because of the volatile BTC price. The difference between 15 standard deviation and 2 standard deviation seems large and a compelling reason to use the largest pool; the difference between 42 and 55 not so much. So what other factors might influence mining pool centralization? Another factor is the fact that pools necessarily “hear” about their own blocks instantly and everyone else’s blocks after some network delay, so larger pools will be mining on outdated blocks less often; this problem is critical for blockchains with a time of ten seconds, but in Bitcoin the effect is less than 1 and thus insignificant. A third factor is convenience; this can best be solved by funding an easy-to-use open-source make-your-own mining pool solution, in a similar spirit to the software used by many small VPS providers; if deemed important, we may end up partially funding a network-agnostic version of such an effort. The last factor that still remains, however, is that GHash has no fee; rather, the pool sustains itself through its connection to the ASIC cloud-mining company CEX.io, which controls 25 of its hashpower. Thus, if we want to really get down to the bottom of the centralization problem, we may need to look at ASICs themselves.ASICsOriginally, Bitcoin mining was intended to be a very egalitarian pursuit. Millions of users around the world would all mine Bitcoin on their desktops, and the result would be simultaneously a distribution model that is highly egalitarian and widely spreads out the initial BTC supply and a consensus model that includes thousands of stakeholders, virtually precluding any possibility of collusion. Initially, the scheme worked, ensuring that the first few million bitcoins got widely spread among many thousands of users, including even the normally cash-poor high school students. In 2010, however, came the advent of mining software for the GPU (“graphics processing unit”), taking advantage of the GPU’s massive parallelization to achieve 10-100x speedups and rendering CPU mining completely unprofitable within months. In 2013, specialization took a further turn with the advent of ASICs. ASICs, or application-specific integrated circuits, are specialized mining chips produced with a single purpose: to crank out as many SHA256 computations as possible in order to mine Bitcoin blocks. As a result of this specialization, ASICs get a further 10-100x speedup over GPUs, rendering GPU mining unprofitable as well. Now, the only way to mine is to either start an ASIC company or purchase an ASIC from an existing one.The way the ASIC companies work is simple. First, the company starts up, does some minimal amount of setup work and figures out its plan, and starts taking preorders. These preorders are then used to fund the development of the ASIC, and once the ASICs are ready the devices are shipped to users, and the company starts manufacturing and selling more at a regular pace. ASIC manufacturing is done in a pipeline; there is one type of factory which produces the chips for ASICs, and then another, less sophisticated, operation, where the chips, together with standard parts like circuit boards and fans, are put together into complete boxes to be shipped to purchasers.So where does this leave us? It’s obvious that ASIC production is fairly centralized; there are something like 10-30 companies manufacturing these devices, and each of them have a significant level of hashpower. However, I did not realize just how centralized ASIC production is until I visited this unassuming little building in Shenzhen, China:On the third floor of the factory, we see:What we have in the first picture are about 150 miners of 780 GH/s each, making up a total 120 TH/s of miners – more than 0.1 of total network hashpower – all in one place. The second picture shows boxes containing another 150 TH/s. Altogether, the factory produces slightly more than the sum of these two amounts – about 300 TH/s – every single day. Now, look at this chart:In total, the Bitcoin network gains about 800 TH/s every day. Thus, even adding some safety factors and assuming the factory shuts down some days a week, what we have is one single factory producing over a quarter of all new hashpower being added to the Bitcoin network. Now, the building is a bit large, so guess what’s on the first floor? That’s right, a fabrication facility producing Scrypt ASICs equal to a quarter of all new hashpower added to the Litecoin network. This projects an image of a frightening endgame for Bitcoin: the Bitcoin network spending millions of dollars of electricity every year only to replace the US dollar’s mining algorithm of “8 white guys” with a few dozen guys in Shenzhen.However, before we get too alarmist about the future of mining, it is important to dig down and understand (1) what’s wrong with ASICs, (2) what’s okay with CPUs, and (3) what the future of ASIC mining is going to look like. The question is a more complex one than it seems. First of all, one might ask, why is it bad that ASICs are only produced by a few companies and a quarter of them pass through one factory? CPUs are also highly centralized; integrated circuits are being produced by only a small number of companies, and nearly all computers that we use have at least some components from AMD or Intel. The answer is, although AMD and Intel produce the CPUs, they do not control what’s run on them. They are general-purpose devices, and there is no way for the manufacturers to translate their control over the manufacturing process into any kind of control over its use. DRM-laden “trusted computing modules” do exist, but it is very difficult to imagine such a thing being used to force a computer to participate in a double-spend attack.With ASIC miners, right now things are still not too bad. Although ASICs are produced in only a small number of factories, they are still controlled by thousands of people worldwide in disparate data centers and homes, and individual miners each usually with less than a few terahashes have the ability to direct their hashpower wherever they need. Soon, however, that may change. In a month’s time, what if the manufacturers realize that it does not make economic sense for them to sell their ASICs when they can insted simply keep all of their devices in a central warehouse and earn the full revenue? Shipping costs would drop to near-zero, shipping delays would go down (one week shipping delay corresponds to ~5.6 revenue loss at current hashpower growth rates) and there would be no need to produce stable or pretty casings. In that scenario, it would not just be 25 of all ASICs that are produced by one factory in Shenzhen; it would be 25 of all hashpower run out of one factory in Shenzhen.When visiting the headquarters of a company in Hangzhou that is involved, among other things, in Litecoin mining, I asked the founders the same question: why don’t you just keep miners in-house? They provided three answers. First, they care about decentralization. This is simple to understand, and is very fortunate that so many miners feel this way for the time being, but ultimately mining will be carried out by firms that care a little more about monetary profit and less about ideology. Second, they need pre-orders to fund the company. Reasonable, but solvable by issuing “mining contracts” (essentially, crypto-assets which pay out dividends equal to a specific number of GH/s of mining power). Third, there’s not enough electricity and space in the warehouses. The last argument, as specious as it seems, may be the only one to hold water in the long term; it is also the stated reason why ASICminer stopped mining purely in-house and started selling USB miners to consumers, suggesting that perhaps there is a strong and universal rationale behind such a decision.Assuming that the funding strategies of selling pre-orders and selling mining contracts are economically equivalent (which they are), the equation for determining whether in-house mining or selling makes more sense is as follows:On the left side, we have the costs of in-house mining: electricity, storage and maintenance. On the right side, we have the cost of electricity, storage and maintenance externally (ie. in buyers’ hands), shipping and the penalty from having to start running the ASIC later, as well as a negative factor to account for the fact that some people mine at least partially for fun and out of an ideological desire to support the network. Let’s analyze these figures right now. We’ll use the Butterfly Labs Monarch as out example, and keep each ASIC running for one year for simplicity.Internal electricity, storage, maintenance – according to BFL’s checkout page, internal electricity, storage and maintennance cost $1512 per year, which we will mark down to $1000 assuming BFL takes some profitExternal electricity – in Ontario, prices are about $0.1 per KwH. A Butterfly Labs Monarch will run 600 GH/s at 350 W; normalizing this to per-TH, this means an electricity cost of $1.40 per day or $511 for the entire yearExternal storage – at home, one can consider storage free, or one can add a convenience fee of $1 per day; hence, we’ll say somewhere from $0 to $365External maintenance – hard to quantify this value; for technically skilled invididuals who enjoy the challenge it’s zero, and for others it might be hard; hence, we can say $0 to $730Shipping cost – according to BFL, $38.Revenue – currently, 1 TH/s gives you 0.036 BTC or $21.6 per day. Since in our analysis hashpower doubles every 90 days, so the effectiveness of the ASIC halves every 90 days, we get 122 days of life or $2562 revenueShipping time – according to my Chinese sources, one weekHashpower doubling time – three months. Hence, the entire expression for the shipping delay penalty is 2562 * (1 - 0.5 ^ 0.0769) = 133.02Hobbyist/ideology premium – currently, a large portion of Bitcoin miners are doing it out of ideological considerations, so we can say anywhere from $0 to $1000Thus, adding it all up, on the left we have $1000, and on the right we have $511 + $38 + $133 = $682, up to plus $1095 and minus up to $1000. Thus, it’s entirely ambiguous which one is better; errors in my analysis and the nebulous variables of how much people value their time and aesthetics seem to far outweigh any definite conclusions. But what will happen in the future? Fundamentally, one can expect that electricity, storage and maintenance would be much cheaper centrally than with each consumer simply due to economies of scale and gains from specialization; additionally most people in the “real world” are not altruists, hobbyists or admirers of beautiful ASIC coverings. Shipping cost are above zero, and the shipping delay penalty is above zero. So thus it seems that the economics roundly favor centralized mining…… except for one potential factor: heat. Right now, ASICs are still in a rapid development phase, so the vast majority of the cost is hardware; the BFL miner used in the above example costs $2200, but the electricity costs $511. In the future, however, development will be much slower; ultimately we can expect a convergence to Moore’s law, with hashpower doubling every two years, and even Moore’s law itself seems to be slowing. In such a world, electricity costs may come back as the primary choke point. But how much does electricity cost? In a centralized warehouse, quite a lot, and the square-cube law guarantees that in a centralized environment even more energy than at home would need to be spent on cooling because all of the miners are in one place and most of them are too deep inside the factory to have exposure to cool fresh air. In a home, however, if the outside temperature is less than about 20’C, the cost of electricity is zero; all electricity spent by the miner necessarily eventually turns into “waste” heat, which then heats the home and substitutes for electricity that would be spent by a central heater. This is the only argument for why ASIC decentralization may work: rather than decentralization happening because everyone has a certain quantity of unused, and thereby free, units of computational time on their laptop, decentralization happens because many people have a certain quantity of demand for heating in their homes.Will this happen? Many Bitcoin proponents seem convinced that the answer is yes. However, I am not sure; it is an entirely empirical question whether or not electricity cost is less than maintenance plus storage plus shipping plus shipping delay penalty, and in ten years’ time the equation may well fall on one side or the other. I personally am not willing to simply sit back and hope for the best. This is why I personally find it disappointing that so many of the core Bitcoin developers (though fortunately not nearly all) are content to consider the proof of work problem “solved” or argue that attempting to solve mining specialization is an act of “needless re-engineering”. It may prove to be, or it may not, but the fact that we are having this discussion in the first place strongly suggests that Bitcoin’s current approach is very far from perfect.ASIC ResistanceThe solution to the ASIC problem that is most often touted is the development of ASIC-resistant mining algorithms. So far, there have been two lines of thought in developing such algorithms. The first is memory-hardness – reducing the power of ASICs to achieve massive gains through parallelization by using a function which takes a very large amount of memory. The community’s first attempt was Scrypt, which proved to be not resistant enough; in January, I attempted to improve Scrypt’s memory-hardness with Dagger, an algorithm which is memory-hard to compute (to the extent of 128 MB) but easy to verify; however, this algorithm is vulnerable to shared-memory attacks where a number of parallel processes can access the same 128 MB of memory. The current state-of-the-art in memory-hard PoW is Cuckoo, an algorithm which looks for length-42 cycles in graphs. It takes a large amount of memory to efficiently find such cycles, but a cycle is very quick to verify, requiring 42 hashes and less than 70 bytes of memory.The second approach is somewhat different: create a mechanism for generating new hash functions, and make the space of functions that it generates so large that the kind of computer best suited to processing them is by definition completely generalized, ie. a CPU. This approach gets close to being “provably ASIC resistant” and thus more future-proof, rather than focusing on specific aspects like memory, but it too is imperfect; there will always be at least some parts of a CPU that will prove to be extraneous in such an algorithm and can be removed for efficiency. However, the quest is not for perfect ASIC resistance; rather, the challenge is to achieve what we can call “economic ASIC resistance” – building an ASIC should not be worth it.This is actually surprisingly likely to be achievable. To see why, note that mining output per dollar spent is, for most people, sublinear. The first N units of mining power are very cheap to produce, since users can simply use the existing unused computational time on their desktops and only pay for electricity (E). Going beyond N units, however, one needs to pay for both hardware and electricity (H + E). If ASICs are feasible, as long as their speedup over commodity hardware is less than (H + E) / E, then even in an ASIC-containing ecosystem it will be profitable for people to spend their electricity mining on their desktops. This is the goal that we wish to strive for; whether we can reach it or not is entirely unknown, but since cryptocurrency as a whole is a massive experiment in any case it does not hurt to try.",

    "text": "BitNation is described as offering a “full range of services traditionally done by governments.” Included in this are secure ID systems, block chain dispute resolutions, marriages and divorces, land registries, education, insurance, security and more. BitNation hopes to accomplish all of this through a fully distributed platform. It seems like the buzz word of 2014 is DAO or DAC (distributed autonomous organization/corporation, respectively). Ethereum has gotten a lot of media for their launch, and BitNation is preparing for their own launch, which takes place in approximately 13 days. I spoke with Susanne, the Founder and CEO of BitNation, about her background, interests and what she hopes to achieve with her project.Victoria: Susanne, what exactly is Bitnation? Can you give us a brief overview of what you’re achieving with this project?Susanne: Bitnation is a Decentralized Organization (DO), offering Governance 2.0 services: borderless, decentralized, and voluntary blockchain-based governance applications through a user-friendly and cost-efficient platform, including a reputation based ID System, Dispute Resolution, Mutual Insurance, Diplomacy, Security and more. What Bitnation essentially provides people with is a toolbox for Do-It-Yourself (DIY) governance. The platform will be released in Q4 2014 in tandem with our upcoming crowdsale. The platform will be open source for people to share, fork, and create their own Bitnation. There will also be an Application Programming Interface (API) layer for 3rd Party DAPP developers to use to create their own governance DAPPS, and then give it away or sell it through our Governance DAPP Library.Interesting. Why did you decide to start this project?I’m from an international family, and I’ve always been moving around a lot throughout my life. To me nations and their arbitrary borders always seemed pointless and I’ve been thinking about different types of voluntary and competitive governance systems for the last decade or so. When I discovered Bitcoin in 2012, I realized it wasn’t maybe as far fetched as a vision as I initially thought, and after spending some time taking a hard look at the Bitcoin technology I realized that most of the fundamental things I wanted to achieve were doable through the blockchain protocol. Additionally, a lot of interesting technologies emerged around the same time, such as Ethereum, Codius, Open Transactions, CounterParty, Coloured Coins, Notary Chains, etc., giving me an unprecedented set of tools to work with to help me realize my vision.Can you give us some examples of what your work is achieving (Bitmarriage, etc.)?In the Western Hemisphere most governance services are already provided for by the government, however this is not always the case – take for instance marriage services for the HBTQ and Polyamory communities. Additionally, many people may prefer, for ideological reasons, not to use centralized services offered by governments, and some may want to use our platform for practical and financial reasons – simply because it’s a more efficient and fair system to integrate into their lives.In emerging and frontier markets, by contrast – in many places – these services do not exist or are nearly impossible to use because overwhelming bureaucracy and corruption. Yet these services are sorely needed; from deeding land, to corporate incorporation, mutual insurance, dispute resolution, and more. Imagine for example Ricardo who owns a house in the favela in Rio de Janeiro, but due to government distrust and corruption he cannot deed it to protect it for his children’s future.Imagine a phone salesman in Cambodia who can’t open a small back office company because it’s difficult to incorporate due to the significant bureaucratic red tape he has to overcome (the incorporation process takes an average of 104 days). But the phone salesman needs to incorporate to sell equity to raise funds, in order to make his vision come true.Or take for instance a Christian family living in Riyadh, who won’t settle their disputes in the local courts because they only cater for Sharia Law. The examples of where the existing systems in place, or the lack thereof, are preventing poor and middle-class people worldwide from enjoying political, social and economic mobility are endless!Very cool. Susanne, what upcoming conferences will you be attending?We will have a panel presence at Coins in the Kingdom conference in early October at Disney World which includes a wedding ceremony being done on the blockchain; as far as we know it is a first of its kind ever. Other than that, I’ll be speaking at the Brazilian Bitcoin conference in Sao Paulo in November, Anarchapulcoin Mexico next year, and I’ll be making a few minor appearances here and there. Since we are a young organization with limited financial and time resources for travelling to events, we haven’t had the time to get full on into the conference circuit yet, but this will most likely change as we grow.What advice do you have for entrepreneurs in the bitcoin space?The crypto space is a wild frontier at the moment – it moves quickly and is unpredictable, not just in terms of technological development but also in terms of regulatory parameters and mainstream adoption. While in other fields it may be possible to take a solitary approach to product development with the help of solid market analysis, that is nearly impossible in this sphere due to the speed of development. Hence, the best way to approach crypto-entrepreneurship is to be aware of, and open to, new developments and to collaborate with as many people as possible. Being inclusive will allow you stay on top of the wave much more than doing your own thing isolated from the input, support, and creativity of the community.What do you see happening in Bitnation’s future?On October 10th, we’re launching our cryptoequity crowdsale to raise seed capital for the organization. The fundraiser will last for 3 months, until January 10th, 2015, with the price increasing as development benchmarks are met. There will be more information about that on the web-site (www.bitnation.co).In Q4 2014 we will launch our platform, along with some core services: ID System, DAPP Library, Dispute Resolution System, “Family” Contracts (e.g. marriage and divorce, wills, childcare contracts, land deeds, etc). In 2015 we will also be launching the insurance, diplomacy and security services. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but we have a brilliant team and community helping to make this a reality.The human ‘architecture’ of Bitnation is at least, if not more important than the technology.Through building our our Ambassador Network (a network of Bitcoin enthusiasts and entrepreneurs primarily in emerging and frontier markets), we create an ecosystem of on-the-ground assessments for governance needs which feeds up to our product design. In turn the Ambassadors can use it or fork it for their community, and create a better adjusted version for their specific context, and leverage it financially.We want to empower entrepreneurs around the world to build and implement their own DIY governance tools. Bitcoin adaption is growing in those markets, especially in places with a high volume of remittance payments like Mexico and the Philippines, or places with a perpetually unstable economy: Argentina, Cyprus, Greece, etc.Our long-term hope is that emerging and frontier market adoption will drive changes in more mature markets who will need to adapt the same governance speed, and flexibility to remain competitive. We believe that the speed and flexibility can only come from a voluntary and decentralized market for governance services.What is the best lesson you have learned so far in your work with bitcoin?That everything is possible!Before I knew about Bitcoin I was very disillusioned about the current political and financial system but I couldn’t see any good, practical solution to any of it. But discovering Bitcoin was amazing… it’s incredible how this arcane branch of mathematics, cryptography suddenly produced a new currency; Bitcoin which in just a few years time went from being worthless algorithms traded by only a few geeks, to a globally known currency that is now on the front page of every mainstream publication. Or another example; who would have thought just a few years back that a currency – backed by a silly meme like “Doge” would start to crowdfund for NASCAR (#98)? And now, well, soon we’ll see the first block chain-based marriages, dispute resolutions, insurances becoming a reality. I truly believe that nothing is impossible in this ever evolving realm!",

    "text": "This guest post by Ian Griggis reprinted with permission from financialcryptography.com.Before Bitcoin, there was cryptocurrency. Indeed, it has a long and deep history. If only for the lessons learned, it is worth studying, and indeed, in my ABC of Bitcoin investing, I consider not knowing anything before Satoshiâ€™s paper as a red flag. Hence, a very fast history of what came before.Early DaysThe first known (to me) attempt at cryptocurrencies occurred in the Netherlands, in the late 1980s, which makes it around 25 years ago or 20BBTC. In the middle of the night, the petrol stations in the remoter areas were being raided for cash, and the operators were unhappy putting guards at risk there. But the petrol stations had to stay open overnight so that the trucks could refuel.Someone had the bright idea of putting money onto the new-fangled smartcards that were then being trialed, and so electronic cash was born. Drivers of trucks were given these cards instead of cash, and the stations were now safer from robbery.At the same time the dominant retailer, Albert Heijn, was pushing the banks to invent some way to allow shoppers to pay directly from their bank accounts, which became eventually to be known as POS or point-of-sale.Digital CashEven before this, David Chaum, an American cryptographer, had been investigating what it would take to create electronic cash. His views on money and privacy led him to believe that in order to do safe commerce, we would need a token money that would emulate physical coins and paper notes: specifically, the privacy feature of being able to safely pay someone hand-to-hand, and have that transaction complete safely and privately.As far back as 1983 or 25BBTC, David Chaum invented the blinding formula, which is an extension of the RSA algorithm still used in the web's encryption. This enables a person to pass a number across to another person, and that number to be modified by the receiver. When the receiver deposits her coin, as Chaum called it, into the bank, it bears the original signature of the mint, but it is not the same number as that which the mint signed. Chaum's invention allowed the coin to be modified untraceably without breaking the signature of the mint, hence the mint or bank was 'blind' to the transaction.All of this interest and also the Netherlands' historically feverish attitude to privacy probably had a lot to do with David Chaum's decision to migrate to the Netherlands. When working in the late 1980s at CWI, a hotbed of cryptography and mathematics research in Amsterdam, he started DigiCash and proceeded to build his Internet money invention, employing amongst many others names that would later become famous: Stefan Brands, Niels Ferguson, Gary Howland, Marcel \"BigMac\" van der Peijl, Nick Szabo, and Bryce \"Zooko\" Wilcox-Ahearn.The invention of blinded cash was extraordinary and it caused an unprecedented wave of press attention. Unfortunately, David Chaum and his company made some missteps, and fell foul of the central bank (De Nederlandsche Bank or DNB). The private compromise that they agreed to was that Digicash's e-cash product would only be sold to banks. This accommodation then led the company on a merry dance attempting to field a viable digital cash through many banks, ending up eventually in bankruptcy in 1998. The amount of attention in the press brought very exciting deals to the table, with Microsoft, Deutsche Bank and others, but David Chaum was unable to use them to get to the next level. At one point Microsoft offered Chaum $180 million to put DigiCash on every Windows PC. But Chaum that it was not enough money, and the deal fell through, and Digicash ran out of money.Second Wave - Web Based MoneyOn the coattails of Digicash there were hundreds of startups per year working on this space, including my own efforts. In the mid 1990s, the attention switched from Europe to North America for two factors: the Netscape IPO had released a huge amount of VC interest, and also Europe had brought in the first regulatory clampdown on digital cash: the 1994 EU Report on Prepaid Cards, which morphed into a reaction against DigiCash.Yet, the first great wave of cryptocurrencies spluttered and died, and was instead overtaken by a second wave of web-based monies. First Virtual was a first brief spurt of excitement, to be almost immediately replaced by PayPal which did more or less the same thing.The difference? PayPal allowed the money to go from person to person, whereas First Virtual had insisted that to accept money you must \"be a merchant,\" which was a popular restriction from banks and regulators, but people hated it. PayPal also leapt forward by proposing its system as being a hand-to-hand cash, literally: the first versions were on the Palm Pilot, which was extraordinarily popular with geeks. This geek-focus was quickly abandoned as PayPal discovered that what people -- real users -- really wanted was money on the web browser. Also, having found a willing userbase in the eBay community, its future was more or less guaranteed as long as it avoided the bank/regulatory minefield laid out for it.As PayPal proved the web became the protocol of choice, even for money, so Chaum's ideas were more or less forgotten in the wider western marketplace, although the tradition was alive in Russia with WebMoney, and there were isolated pockets of interest in the crypto communities. In contrast, several ventures started up chasing a variant of PayPal's web-hybrid: gold on the web. The company that succeeded initially was called e-gold, an American-based operation that had its corporation in Nevis in the Caribbean.e-gold was a fairly simple idea: you send in your physical gold or 'junk' silver, and they would credit e-gold to your account. Or you could buy new e-gold, by sending a wire to Florida, and they would buy and hold the physical gold. By tramping the streets and winning customers over, the founder managed to get the company into the black and up and growing by around 1999. As e-gold the currency issuer was offshore, it did not require US onshore approval, and this enabled it for a time to target the huge American market of 'goldbugs' and also a growing worldwide community of Internet traders who needed to do cross-border payments. With its popularity on the increase, the independent exchange market exploded into life in 2000, and its future seemed set.The Regulatory Buste-gold however ran into trouble for its libertarian ideal of allowing anyone to have an account. While in theory this is a fine concept, the steady stream of ponzis, HYIPs, 'games' and other scams attracted the attention of the Feds. In 2005, e-gold's Florida offices were raided and that was the end of the currency as an effective force. The Feds also proceeded to mop up any of the competitors and exchange operations they could lay their hands on, ensuring the end of the second great wave of new monies.In retrospect, 9/11 marked a huge shift in focus. Beforehand, the USA was fairly liberal about alternative monies, seeing them as potential business, innovation for the future. After 9/11 the view switched dramatically, albeit slowly; all cryptocurrencies were assumed to be hotbeds of terrorists and drugs dealers, and therefore valid targets for total control. It's probably fair to speculate that e-gold didn't react so well to the shift. Meanwhile, over in Europe, they were going the other way. It had become abundantly clear that the attempt to shut down cryptocurrencies was too successful, Internet business preferred to base itself in the USA, and there had never been any evidence of the bad things they were scared of. Successive generations of the eMoney law were enacted to open up the field, but being Europeans they never really understood what a startup was, and the slightly less-high barriers remained deal killers.Which brings us forward to 2008, and the first public posting of the Bitcoin paper by Satoshi Nakamoto.ConclusionWhat's all this worth? The best way I can make this point is an appeal to authority:Satoshi Nakamoto wrote, on releasing the code:> You know, I think there were a lot more people interested in the 90's,> but after more than a decade of failed Trusted Third Party based systems> (Digicash, etc), they see it as a lost cause. I hope they can make the> distinction that this is the first time I know of that we're trying a> non-trust-based system.Bitcoin is a result of history; when decisions were made, they rebounded along time and into the design. Nakamoto may have been the mother of Bitcoin, but it is a child of many fathers: David Chaum's blinded coins and the fateful compromise with DNB, e-gold's anonymous accounts and the post-9/11 realpolitik, the cypherpunks and their libertarian ideals, the banks and their industrial control policies, these were the whole cloth out of which Nakamoto cut the invention.And, finally it must be stressed, most all successes and missteps we see here in the growing Bitcoin sector have been seen before. History is not just humming and rhyming, it's singing loudly.",

    "text": "In April 2014, Storj, an open source decentralized storage platform, won the Texas Bitcoin Conference’s hackathon, netting them $250,000 from the BitAngels Fund. The crowdsale for their token SJCX and early access to the software has begun and will be running until August 18th (3 days).The future of cloud storage is decentralization. Imagine being able to rent out your extra hard drive space through an autonomous network and getting paid for it in a cryptocurrency. This is being made possible thanks to Satoshi Nakamoto and platforms such as Storj, Maidsafe, Ethereum and others. Now that we have the ability to tie P2P currency to resources such as storage space, bandwidth usage, and CPU power, services like Dropbox and Google Drive will be getting a run for their money.Unlike other 2.0 platforms, Storj has decided to take a “baby steps” approach for developing their software. They want to build their system out in small, modular pieces first so that they can be used as working prototypes. The first of these pieces is a drag-and-drop file hosting web app called Metadisk, which recently had its whitepaper and video tutorial released. It’s important to note that Metadisk is just one piece of Storj, and as development progresses, more of these web apps, such as DriveShare (used for renting out your own hard drive space), will be coming together to form a more cohesive whole.Cost Storj has come out with an infographic on the comparative costs of storing data between a decentralized system like Storj and a traditional centralized system like Dropbox. The results are staggering. Storj claims that buying and selling hard drive space in an autonomous network would reduce the cost of cloud computing by orders of magnitude, 10-100x cheaper. Currently, one can rent out 100GB of storage space from Dropbox for $99 a year. Even if a user does not employ the full 100GB, he or she still has to pay the price. With Storj, one would be able to rent out a VPS (Virtual Private Server) from a service such as Digital Ocean and run a 100GB MetaDisk webnode for only $1.47, which includes redundancy backup copies. Add $0.49 for cost of retrieving the data, and we’re looking at $1.96 for the same amount of storage as Dropbox’s $99 offer. On top of that, a user may rent out their extra hard drive space and make a substantial profit with Storj. In Dropbox’s model, if you pay $99 for 100GB a year but don’t use half the space you end up paying for what could potentially be profit.The cost of storage generally gets cheaper and cheaper over time, since storage media capabilities double every 12 months. If a decentralized storage system was completely autonomous, the price of storage could eventually drop near the 0 mark. For current centralized cloud services, this would be impossible, as explained best in the Metadisk whitepaper: “This is competitive with centralized file hosts because even if their cost for storage media halves each year, their ongoing operating costs in data center rents, employee salaries, accounting costs, regulatory burden, legal fees, etc. will remain fixed or increase year over year, limiting their ability to compete with a decentralized model that has no such costs.” – MetaDisk WhitepaperSecurity In an interview with The Guardian, Edward Snowden called Dropbox a “targeted wannabe PRISM partner” that is “very hostile to privacy.” With Storj, client-side encryption would ensure that files are secure.Blockchain Storj wants to use multiple blockchains to store metadata as a sort of directory for where files are stored and how much redundancy they have. Once the blockchains are too large, they’ll use Merkle tree configurations to speed up this process, similar to how Bitcoin SPV wallets work.Speed I asked Storj’s founder Shawn Wilkinson about the expected speed of the network once scaled to expectation. “Compare Dropbox and any peer-to-peer network. At scale, peer-to-peer networks will blow any centralized service out of the water. My goal is maximum throughput, so fast that your internet connection is the bottleneck not the network because at the base we have rewarded transfer.” Crowdsale Storj recently started their crowdsale on July 18th, selling their token SJCX on Counterwallet in exchange for Bitcoin. 15 of SJCX goes to the developers, 15 goes to the community and 70 goes towards the crowdsale. Only participants in the crowdsale will be allowed to sell their hard drive space in the early network through DriveShare. Metadisk is already available to participants. What is SJCX good for?You earn it from selling your hard drive spaceYou use it to buy hard drive space on the Storj networkAllows exclusive access to Metadisk and DriveShareYou get at least 10 of all new experimental coins made from STORJThe crowdsale has so far collected nearly 600 BTC and will be ending on August 18th.

    "title": "There has been a lot of talk in recent months regarding the role of cryptocurrency for the future of crowdfunding",
    "text": "There has been a lot of talk in recent months regarding the role of cryptocurrency for the future of crowdfunding and equity creation. A new company is taking a different, and seemingly more widespread approach to cryptoequity and community funding of early stage projects and business ventures. This new platform, called Swarm, is co-founded by Joel Dietz, a former California native who now resides in Berlin. Swarm is the world’s first distributed incubator, and uses technology built on Bitcoin to allow startups to raise money through launching their own coin.This platform is providing a novel way to invest in innovation without the large barrier to entry of conventional funding methods. Holders of Swarm’s own coin (SwarmCoin) will receive a percentage of these new coins as a reward for their support of the Swarm community. This means by investing in Swarm you will be rewarded with additional coins from successful campaigns. This allows for higher returns and a faster path to the market. By far, Swarm’s capability to create a platform that utilizes Bitcoin as a technology and means of funding may have monumental implications on the future of equity investments.As we are witnessing, crowdfunding plays a large role in the future success of startups. Many larger platforms were starting to reach equity funding, but following guidelines was challenging. It seems however that Dietz and the team at Swarm have responded to this challenge and are in the midst of something that has never been seen throughout the industry. “Swarm came together in my mind. I was aware of crowdfunding for a long time. Initially, I was involved with early Kickstarter and unconventional funding campaigns, and until Ethereum, I never really thought of the further uses of Bitcoin technology, but it clicked. What we are doing has huge potential and can change the industry and spark change from the bottom up,” Dietz stated.The crowdfunding model is unlike current accelerator models used today, which are fixed in one location and profit only a few partners. Instead, every person who owns a SwarmCoin will get a portion of every coin launched throughout the network. Users will also be incentivized to try out and seek additional projects that are associated with each coin. Starting on June 17th, Swarm will make 100 million SwarmCoin in a limited-time crowd sale, which runs until July 20th.Phase One consists of 4,000 bitcoin and people participating on day one will receive 5,250 SwarmCoin per bitcoin. As more bitcoins are received, the number of SwarmCoin distributed will decrease to 4,750 until the end of Phase One. After a short period, Phase Two will be aiming at 17,000 bitcoins with a conversion rate of 4,250 SwarmCoin, decreasing to 3,750 per bitcoin until all are gone. This will all be done to meet Swarm’s projected 18-month expenses, including developing the core infrastructure and usability to allow the creation of new coins. With a full raise of 21,500 BTC, Swarm will be a true incubator, not only with infrastructure but to help get projects and new coins off the ground.Dietz commented, “This whole idea of having your own token that can appreciate in value is monumental. Existing crowdfunding platforms could use the technology of Bitcoin, but they aren’t focused on that. There is obvious friction that exists in early stage investing, including having to be an accredited investor or owning a legal entity. With Swarm, users don’t need to have a legal entity and they can fund all sorts of open source software projects without the red tape. Not just crypto companies but companies in all industries.”Swarm is focused on hitting their goals and launching a platform that allows for crowd sales throughout the Bitcoin community, which is something many have been seeking out. After its initial funding period, Swarm believes that there will be a large amount of projects that will be focused on decentralized and open-source funding. We are in the mere starting stages of what the future holds for the crowdfunding and cryptoequity industry. The challenge that many face is matching the ease of use with the correct due diligence, something that Swarm believes they are doing today. Platforms like Swarm acknowledge the problems that have happened in the space, is solving them and bringing with it massive potential.“There is a lot of organizational infrastructure that can be put together for it to be successful. With Bitcoin and the Blockchain, we can build the groundwork for emerging companies and projects and help them be successful,” said Dietz.For more information, check out Swarm.",

    "title": "The Court of Justice of the European Union received on 02.06.2014 the Preliminary Ruling of The Swedish Supreme Administrative Court",
    "text": "The Court of Justice of the European Union received on 02.06.2014 the Preliminary Ruling of The Swedish Supreme Administrative Court (“Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen”) on the interpretation of Article 135.1 of the Directive 2006/112/EC on VAT taxation on bitcoin. The number assigned to the case is C-264-14 (published in the Official Journal C 245 on 28.07.2014, p.7).The preliminary ruling was originated by an advance tax ruling submitted by David Hedqvist (moderator of Section Sweden of bitcointalk.org and founder of www.bitcoin.se), who intended to carry on a business through a switching operation with the virtual currency bitcoin to “fiat” currency.The Swedish Authority for the Ruling first dealt with the Decision 10.14.2013 (ref. 32-12. / I Mervärdesskatt: Handel med bitcoins) on trade in bitcoins.The Ruling resolved that the absence of the definition of the term “currency” in the VAT Directive leads to the interpretation of this term as a means of payment.In the Article 135.1 of Directive 2006/112/EC letter e) (“transactions, including negotiation, concerning currency, bank notes and coins used as legal tender, with the exception of collectors' items, that is to say, gold, silver or other metal coins or bank notes which are not normally used as legal tender or coins of numismatic interest”) the term currency is not associated to legal tender. The presence of the exception of the \"collectors’ items\" that certainly were legal tender, but are not normally used as such because they are collectors’ items, is reported only to coins and banknotes. This excludes the concept of \"currency\" of the need of legal tender.On the basis of these considerations:Exchange of bitcoin requires similar requirements to intermediation of financial services,The bitcoins are a means of payment used in a similar way to legal tender,The bitcoin have strong similarities with electronic money.The Authority for the Swedish Ruling held that bitcoin transactions should be considered as transactions concerning currency referred to in Article 135.1. letter e), consistent with the purposes of the exemptions provided for in Article 135.1. (Avoid the difficulties associated with applying VAT to financial services.). Tax Swedish Tax Authority (Skatteverket) appealed the Decision 32-12. / I to the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court that considered the case (Case No. 7101-13) and resolved to submit a Preliminary Ruling under Article 267 TFEU.The Swedish Supreme Administrative Court reflected that the Court of Justice had never considered how Article 135.1 d), e), f) of the Directive 2006/112/EC must be interpreted with respect to foreign exchange transactions related to virtual currencies. According to the Supreme Administrative Court's opinion, it is unclear whether any of these exemptions could include those exchange transactions.The Supreme Administrative Court raised the following questions:Does the exchange of virtual currency with “fiat” currency constitute a supply of service under VAT Directive?In case of positive answer, are the exchange transactions of bitcoin exempt from VAT under article 135.1 of VAT Directive?On August 21th David Hedqvist published a post on www.bitcoin.se and www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin asking for help funding legal costs for supporting the case hiring a top law firm in Sweden (language of the case is Sweden); the problem was resolved on August, 26th with an anonymous donor who covered all expenses and let Hedqvist hiring Mannheimer Swartling.Many lawyers and tax consultants (included me) offered pro-bono assistance to Heqvist because the case will decide if and how VAT should be applied to bitcoin throughout the EU.The situation in Europe is very heterogeneous and only a few Member States gave interpretations: GERMANY: The German Ministry of Finance, answering (DOK: 2013/0752711 and 2013/0883337) to deputy Frank Schaeffler (No. 409 of July 2013, n. 226, September 2013), resolved that bitcoins are \"private money\" or complementary currencies, used as a means of payment in the multilateral clearing system and based on private agreements.The Ministry denied the exemption as coin and/or foreign currencies (Article 4 number 8 letter b of the German VAT Law - UStG) and considered bitcoin VAT exempt pursuant to point c, (Art. 135.1 d Directive 2006/112/EC), as “transactions, including negotiation, concerning deposit and current accounts, payments, transfers, debts, cheques and other negotiable instruments, but excluding debt collection”; considering that the mere payment does not constitute the provision of the service and therefore not subject to VAT. UNITED KINGDOM: HMCR, with Revenue & Customs Brief 09/14 resolved that:Income received from Bitcoin mining activities will generally be outside the scope of VAT on the basis that the activity does not constitute an economic activity for VAT purposes because there is an insufficient link between any services provided and any consideration received.Income received by miners for other activities, such as for the provision of services in connection with the verification of specific transactions for which specific charges are made, will be exempt from VAT under Article 135(1)(d) of the EU VAT Directive as falling within the definition of 'transactions, including negotiation, concerning deposit and current accounts, payments, transfers, debts, cheques and other negotiable instruments.'When Bitcoin is exchanged for Sterling or for foreign currencies, such as Euros or Dollars, no VAT will be due on the value of the Bitcoins themselves.Charges (in whatever form) made over and above the value of the Bitcoin for arranging or carrying out any transactions in Bitcoin will be exempt from VAT under Article 135(1)(d) as outlined at 2 above.ESTONIA: The Estonian tax authority (Maksu Tolliamet-ja), in March of 2014, published on its website an interpretation of the taxation of bitcoin, resolving that bitcoin does not fall under any of exemption of article 135.1 of Directive 2006/112/EC, because the financial services are listed and requires certain characteristics that bitcoin does not have. The authority bases its resolution in a strict interpretation of means of payments, electronic money, securities and financial services, considering transactions in bitcoin as provision of services subject to normal VAT taxation. POLONIA: The directors of the local tax authority in Poland (Interpretacja Dyrektora Izby Skarbowej w Łodzi, IPTPP2/443-52/14-6/IR, Poznaniu ILPP1/443-912/13-2/AW, Katowicach, IBPP2/443-762/13/ICz in http://www.epodatnik.pl/) resolved the sale of bitcoin couldn’t be exempted under art. 135.1 of the Directive 2006/112/EC and therefore, as a service, is subject to normal VAT taxation. The interpretations were based on the assumption that the exemptions referred to Directive 2006/112/EC must be interpreted strictly (CJEU Judgment no. C-461/08 paragraph 25) and that the same exemptions (pursuant to art. 131) are subject to the conditions laid down by the Member States, even if is recognized that bitcoin is, at the same time, a unit of account and a payment system, but:The payment system does not have any issuers or any institutions to supervise.The unit of account cannot be considered a currency due to a lack of legal status.FRANCE declared (Report to the French Senate) that it will support at the EU level a VAT exemption for bitcoin, in order to avoid reiterating the unfortunate experience of the massive VAT fraud over CO2 quotas. The situation is very concerning, not only for bitcoins, but for every kind of complementary currencies that, under VAT Directive, are not dissimilar to cryptocurrencies, so the decision will impact any kind of private / community currencies.",

    "title": "In order to create a broad appeal for the concepts behind cryptocurrencies clear communication is crucial. Some of the terminology",
    "text": "In order to create a broad appeal for the concepts behind cryptocurrencies clear communication is crucial. Some of the terminology used in describing Bitcoin has been widely accepted, and taken as a given, almost unchangeable feature of cryptocurrencies. Other, more precisely codified components of the protocol can be changed as long as there is consensus around the usefulness of this change and more than 50 of the people running the Bitcoin network accept the new version. The metaphors and the corresponding terms used to describe how Bitcoin works can also be updated, or even radically changed, if we think that the change would provide value. Why would we do that? As Bitcoin becomes mainstream, or aims to do so, one of the most important hurdles to overcome going beyond the early adopter crowd, is to be able to clearly explain what Bitcoin is and what are its advantages. The more effective we are in this, the faster it will be understood and the number of its users will increase more rapidly.The Weight Of False AnalogiesOne of the fundamental concepts of the Bitcoin protocol and corresponding network is the Blockchain, the public ledger of transactions that lists every sender address, recipient address and the amount that has been transferred using Bitcoin. The computers participating in the global distributed effort to cryptographically encode the chain of transactions play a fundamental role. Explaining what they do and why they do it is an extremely valuable part of making Bitcoin understood by everybody. Traditionally we called this activity of the computers mining, and their operators miners.Are the images and analogies that the mining metaphor applied to Bitcoin brings into our minds useful? If there are these advantages to choose, do the advantages weigh more than disadvantages, or is it the other way around? The origin of the mining metaphor comes from the fact that money used to be represented by coins minted from precious metals. The scarcity of gold and silver use for coins, and the mining operations around them to extract them from locations around the world where they could be found, has its own lore, and charisma. Traditional economic theory requires this scarcity as a direct cause of the value of gold, and as a consequence of the coins minted from gold. Since we wanted bitcoins to be perceived as precious, and also their maximum number is set by the protocol and they appear to be consequently scarce, it looked like the mining metaphor could work. And we started using it.There are however too many things that all this talk about mining implies that not only don’t apply, but are actually harmful to understanding Bitcoin: the imagery that comes with it of shiny golden coins, which link us to old perceptions of what the nature of Bitcoin is, and how it should be handled; the selfish activity of the miners, the gold rush, where the metal which is intrinsically useful in some industrial process, or in electronics, gets whipped to ridiculous valuations; the value of gold as investment… These and others don’t apply or only very weakly apply to Bitcoin, but we bring them with us nonetheless with the power of the words we accepted.Weaving and Weavers: the First AutomationA different metaphor however, coming from a completely different area of economic endeavor, could be better for several reasons. We could use the term weaving for the activity of the computers, and we could call their operators weavers, referring to a metaphor from the textile industry. The weavers take the intertwined threads and through their expert, value added activity create a strong fabric – which is exactly what the global distributed network of computers creating the Bitcoin Blockchain does!And think about it! Weaving machines were the first ones to be automated at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The Jacquard looms’ punch cards, which allowed any pattern to be programmed by experts, are nothing less than predecessors of the perforated cards programming our first computers. The rhythm of the weft and warp being locked together, forming the textile is the ten minute heartbeat of Bitcoin network.Now, of course, no metaphor should go too far; no analogy can be perfect. I am sure we can easily find elements of the textile industry and of the activity of weaving that don’t apply to Bitcoin. But that is okay, as long as many of us believe that what it represents, with its imagery of a rich tapestry of variable and exotic fabric, is a step in the right direction.The goal of course is to go beyond the early adopters, to be able to talk to a larger audience, with friendly, familiar expressions that can be easily understood – to all kinds of demographics, beyond the geeks, and the libertarians. Could women be more easily drawn into the world of Bitcoin if we spoke about weaving the fabric of global financial emancipation? Could this result in a more attractive mental image than the macho world of secretive, solitary miners searching for gold?The weaver metaphor extends beautifully to all the applications of the Bitcoin protocol beyond payments, too. What are these applications? Well, obviously, they are the emerging patterns in the fabric as encoded in the Blockchain! Different applications can overlap, and coexist, creating an ever richer tapestry.And what about separate entities in the ecosystem, like Ethereum, Ripple, and others? They can be thought of as a separate fabric on additional looms, may be designed differently, which work to weave their own patterns.Path Dependence of Our Memetic FutureThe inspiration of our narratives matters, whether we think of the kinds of spaceships we design because of what Star Trek showed us, or imagine new social organizations based on a science fiction universe of a favorite author. The technology choices we make generate lock-in, and the ecosystem of solutions, and applications built on them makes it hard to change things after the fact.Unlike our eyes wired backwards in their sockets, which need the very sensors be punched through to send the signals into our brains (all true!), like a television screen designed by a drunken joker, we must make sure that this narrative for Bitcoin, and the inspiration to a generation of designers and coders creates sustainable dependencies.It is a fun game: instead of lazily accepting what we are told, what new, and clever ways to talk about Bitcoin can we come up with? It is not too late, and we can for sure find a receptive audience to our attempts to explain the wonders and the promise of cryptocurrencies: with friends, business associates, in our families or at conferences when we address a larger audience, giving an interview to journalists, or writing a blog post. Try it next time, and let’s see what happens. If the weavers’ metaphor takes hold, it will have possibly meant a step in the right direction for a global acceptance of Bitcoin.",

    "title": "AUTHOR'S NOTE: It has been suggested to me that this article may be premature, given the developing nature of the",
    "text": "AUTHOR'S NOTE: It has been suggested to me that this article may be premature, given the developing nature of the Mt. Gox situation. However, I wanted to go ahead and put it out for US taxpayers for two reasons. First, how you proceed with your recovery efforts will have an impact on what kind of loss you can claim in 2014 and later. Second, certain regulatory filings that you may be required to submit will be due long before Gox is settled. I will provide updates to the suggestions here as appropriate and I am always willing to answer questions via email. Mt. Gox is out of action, probably for good. Its parent company has filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan and the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York has launched a probe into potential criminal conduct by the company and its management. You had coins at Mt. Gox and it looks like you might have lost them forever. Now what do you do?First, you will need to determine how much you’ve lost. The best way to do this would be with a recent download of your records from Mt. Gox. Though the website was still down as of the date of publication, it is possible that some functionality may be restored in the coming weeks for just this purpose. If this doesn’t happen and if you haven’t kept records independently of your Mt. Gox account, then you may be able to indirectly determine how much you’ve lost using records from your bank or payment processor. An accountant should be able to help you with this. A loss at Mt. Gox would most likely have to be claimed for 2014 or later, so you have plenty of time left to calculate your loss.Next, you must consider what kind of loss you have suffered, which determines how it can be claimed for income tax purposes. Bitcoins probably won’t be considered securities by the IRS, so worthless securities treatment is not likely to be applicable to this situation. Capital loss treatment may be allowable to the extent that bitcoin losses are not recouped in connection with bankruptcy proceedings. However, in order to claim the loss, there must be no chance of ever recovering your coins. For individuals, capital losses are capped at the amount of a taxpayer’s capital gains for the year or $3,000, whichever is greater. Unused capital losses can be carried forward to future years until exhausted.Casualty loss treatment may be available to taxpayers as an alternative to capital loss treatment. According to the IRS, “a casualty is the damage, destruction or loss of property resulting from an identifiable event due to some sudden, unusual, or unexpected cause.” Subject to certain qualifications, individuals may elect to deduct losses suffered on deposits in a bankrupt or insolvent financial institution as either a casualty loss, a theft loss, or an ordinary loss. Of the three, ordinary loss treatment is likely to be the most favorable from a tax perspective. However, the IRS may disallow losses claimed in connection with this provision on the grounds that Mt. Gox was not a qualified financial institution under the definition of the Internal Revenue Code.If Mt. Gox’s management is found to have engaged in improper conduct, then theft loss treatment may be your best option. How the theft was committed, and by whom, determine who can claim the loss. Mt. Gox owes its customers hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins. That debt will need to be dealt with in liquidation proceedings. If Mt. Gox lacks the assets to make its customers whole because a third party has exploited the exchange, then Mt. Gox has likely suffered a deductible theft loss (not its customers). The company is itself reportedly exploring the possibility of a criminal complaint related to its collapse. On the other hand, if the company’s management has engaged in criminal conduct which either directly or indirectly resulted in the theft of its customers’ assets, then its customers are the ones who are likely to have suffered the loss for which the theft deduction can be claimed.Casualty and theft losses are subject to a floor of $100 and 10 of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. That means that the amount of the loss, minus $100, is deductible to the taxpayer only to the extent that it exceeds 10 of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. The deductible loss must also be reduced by the amount of any compensation received in connection with bankruptcy proceedings or a lawsuit. A side note: the IRS has established a safe harbor for deductibility of certain claims for losses on investments stemming from a Madoff-type Ponzi Scheme. Even if Mt. Gox is ultimately discovered to have operated as a fractional reserve for all or part of the period leading up to its failure, this safe harbor will be unavailable to US taxpayers in connection with Mt. Gox losses because bitcoins are not investment securities.After you have calculated your loss and determined how to deduct it, you should consider the need for additional filings related to your activity at Mt. Gox. While you will likely have to wait until 2015 at the earliest to claim a loss related to the failure of the exchange, you have considerably less time to file a Foreign Bank Account Report or IRS Form 8938 for 2013. A US taxpayer must file IRS Form 8938, “Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets,” if, as of the last day of the tax year, he owned or had an interest in foreign financial assets exceeding $50,000 (or $75,000 at any time during the year). The form is due with the taxpayer’s return (not later than April 15, 2014 for 2013 returns). An extension of time to file that is applicable to the taxpayer’s return also applies to this form. The Foreign Bank Account Report must be filed by June 30 by any taxpayer with an interest in a foreign bank account that exceeded $10,000 at any time during the previous year. Given Bitcoin’s substantial gains in 2013, it is likely that many US taxpayers who were customers at exchanges outside the US will need to file this form. Timely filing of the FBAR is mandatory; no extensions are granted.Regulatory filings are especially important for 2013 because the US government is already in possession of Mt. Gox’s records (or will be soon) in connection with its investigation. Ironically, the Department of Justice may know more about your account than you do. While the focus of the probe is not likely to be the company’s customers per se, it is impossible to predict how the investigation will proceed or whether the records will be shared with other agencies. On a related note, I have been asked by at least one taxpayer whether it would be a good idea to submit an FBAR if you aren’t certain that you exceeded $10,000 in assets, but think you might have. My answer is “probably not.” If you haven’t kept up with your records, then you will have to decide on your own what you should do before the deadline, but here is my $.02: In order to complete the form, you must supply the maximum value for your account during the year. If you’re not certain what the maximum was and also aren’t absolutely certain that you exceeded the reporting threshold, then you may end up hurting yourself in two ways. You will be filing a form that you have reason to know is misstated, perhaps materially so and you may be telling the tax authorities that you had more money last year than you actually did. Either or both of those mistakes could cost you during an audit.Now may be too early to guess with any degree of accuracy just what will become of Mt. Gox, Mark Karpeles, or what’s left of the missing $500,000,000 in bitcoins. If history is any indication, Bitcoin’s best known exchange isn’t coming back in any form, ever. The goodwill enjoyed by the company, which it painstakingly built up over half a decade as Bitcoin has grown, is now worthless. The very name of the exchange is utterly toxic, as evidenced by the currency of the word “gox” as a verb in the English language. Many Bitcoiners who have just been goxed are likely experiencing the bitterness of a failed investment for the first time in their lives. To those unfortunate people, I would say that nothing can prepare you for the visceral reality of watching the disappearance before your eyes of a real chunk of wealth that you used to own. I would say that, but I know from experience that it wouldn’t make you feel better and would probably just piss you off. Nevertheless, the number of bitcoins in Mt. Gox's possession isn't likely to actually be zero, so there may be some hope yet for at least a partial recovery of your money.",

    "text": "John Biggs has a writing problem. It’s terrible.I too know manias. I see them most often among writers who have a mania for writing even when they have nothing to say. Such is the case with John Biggs’ recent Bitcoin’s Image Problem.First off, Bitcoin’s image problem is evident to anyone watching the mainstream media’s portrayal of BTC as the domain of drug dealers and terrorists, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Bitcoin’s image problem is one fabricated by writers like Mr. Biggs.But let’s look at his obvious blunders. Writing students, pay attention. He claims “Its followers see themselves as freedom fighters, attacking outsiders with vengeance and talking up their own accomplishments in the language of the already victorious.“ This sentence is an assertion made without evidence, and one that ascribes a universal characteristic (freedom fighters, attacking outsiders with vengeance, etc…) to the whole of the Bitcoin user base without differentiation. Having just attended nearly every workshop and panel of the North American Bitcoin Conference on Miami Beach, I can assure you that freedom fighters, or even those claiming to be freedom fighters were scarcely to be found. And just to establish some kind of credibility here, having worked in South Africa on behalf of the ANC, I know a freedom fighter when I see one.It is true that among some outliers in the Bitcoin community (and I do not mean any pejorative by the word outlier), one may find the overheated rhetoric of anarchists and radical libertarians. What else is new? One can hear them at any time of day on almost any subject across the radio airwaves and in the comments section of every local newspaper. No one mistakes the tin foil hats for the majority’s sensible headgear.Biggs really goes off the rails with statements like “These incremental hoots make it seem like bitcoin is growing. It isn’t, at least not in a global sense.” To say that Bitcoin adoption is not growing on a global scale ignores the facts of what we see all around us. Ask them at Tiger Direct. Perhaps Biggs would like to say that climate change is not happening either.And let’s look at this one: “There is no impetus for the average user to dump money into an unregulated system that appears as volatile as the currency of some banana republic run by a capricious dictator.” Funny, Latin America is where we find enormous demand for the services that Bitcoin can provide. And I would suggest Mr. Biggs drop his ever-so-gringo caricatures of our neighbors to the south.“Finally, bitcoin users are seen as misogynistic and sexist.” That’s a handy slur. The presentation by Elizabeth Ploshay on the subject of Bitcoin and its potential for the empowerment of women at the Miami conference was one of the best attended and most lively. Not one sexist remark from the audience. Not a hoot or a whistle or a wolf-call. Should conventions such as these adopt non-harassment policies? Of course. So should every business conference in the world. (“TechCrunch learned far too late”) It wasn't Bitcoin conferences that prompted the formulation of those guidelines, they were prompted by a historically discriminatory business environment. To suggest that Bitcoin users are any more misogynistic and sexist than any other group is transparently misleading, especially as no evidence is offered.“Unlike the Internet, there is no clear way forward, no use case that the average user will accept as valid.” Really, Mr. Biggs. You must not have been around in the early days of the internet, as I was. There was no clear way forward then either.But perhaps you haven’t read in the history books about that time that the driving economy of the early internet, as it was with the VCR, was pornography. This inconvenient little truth kind of puts your moralistic little tome in perspective. It’s just silly, the product of yet another immature writer with a mania for writing. Here’s a suggestion from Creative Writing 101. Write What You Know.",

    "text": "Cats are worshipped. They are the most popular pet in the world. People who own cats have a strange and strong obsession with these furry and elusive creatures. This deep respect, admiration and possible obsession is very noticeable now that we’re all on the Internet. I think it’s safe to say that the power of the cat on the Internet cannot be overstated.Take for example the ‘art wave’ of Internet cat videos. TIFF, a charitable cultural organization whose projects include the annual Toronto International Film Festival in September, actually showed a nation-wide film reel of popular cat videos, including, but not limited to: Henri: the Existential Cat; L’il Bub; Boots/Cats and many more. The event was an instant success, with screenings selling out nation-wide almost immediately. In fact, Laureen Harper, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s wife, made the trip to Toronto to show her personal love and dedication to this beloved animal.You are witness to this sensation, too. Have you ever seen a link to a funny cat video on Facebook? Perhaps this one, of ninja cat. This video got over 43 million views on YouTube. It’s great. Or perhaps you have seen this heroic cat, saving a child from a vicious dog attack. This particular video garnered over 22 million hits. Cat videos make us laugh, but they also show us the protective nature of cats. Cats are often brushed aside as aloof and disinterested animals; in fact, they feel for us, love us, and can even protect us when we are in harm.Our obsession with cats is not a new phenomenon. We humans have always been this way. In Ancient Egypt, cats were considered a ‘revered animal’ and were extremely important in both society and religion. In fact, some cats even received the same mummification after death as humans.The Greeks, another honoured and respected society, also loved cats. The Greek historian Herodotus wrote that in the event of a fire, men would guard the fire to make certain that no cats ran into the flame. In addition, he noted that “when a cat died, the household would go into mourning as if for a human relative, and would often shave their eyebrows to signify their loss.”In fact, in the height of both of these great civilizations, human beings were sentenced to death for killing a cat — even accidentally.However, despite the laughs they give us, we know that not all cats are loved. If I could feasibly house all the cats in the world to ensure none of them suffered at the hands of other, less-evolved beings, I would! It’s not a viable reality. So, unfortunately, many cats enter this world to live vicious and brutal lives – facing malnourishment or starvation, attacks by other animals higher up the food chain, or even human-inflicted abuse. The reason for this is simple: cats breed quickly, and they breed often. There are too many of them out there to love.Now, earlier populations like the Egyptians and Greeks had an excuse: they simply did not have access to the proper technology to solve this cat population problem. Indeed, they would ‘cull kittens’ to keep the amount of cats in reasonable numbers.Primitive technology disabled earlier populations from effectively controlling the cat population. However, in 2014, we have the technology to spay and neuter cats and work to ensure that each cat born is born for a purpose – not as an accident, with no where to go, no one to love, and no one to love them. Even still, however, shelters across ‘developed’ nations like Canada still report surprising figures about the welfare of modern-day cats.Each shelter is purportedly “bursting” with cats. These shelters can’t take on the responsibility of neutering these cats, though. As a result, cat population continues to be a problem. Shelters are sometimes forced to euthanize our friendly critters because they become sick due to overcrowding. Furthermore, neglectful and ignorant humans sometimes abuse the animals they are trusted to love and care for, increasing the pressure on shelters to provide care, and a suitable home, for these harmed creatures. Shelters transform the fate of cats and offer them love, and a possible happy ‘forever’ home.Cat population control doesn’t need to be a problem anymore. We know cats breed, but we have the technology to change it. I can only assume that this continues to be a problem because we are simply not aware of the severity of the cat-population issue, or perhaps we are, but it’s just not at the forefront of our radar, what with life, and all.However, we do know what Grumpy Cat said in his last Internet-famous meme, and we absolutely know how ridiculously cute Maru is when he slides across the floor into a soda-pop box and stares up at us. We see cats online every day….Being aware of this clear cultural obsession with cats, the Canadian Federation for Humane Societies – a collection of national humane societies, the Society for the Protection of Animals and other interested like-minded organizations -paired up with film festivals across Canada to get people to recognize that cat population control can’t just be done by humane societies themselves – it is a “community problem that requires community effort.”I wondered. The cat community is a strong one. So is the bitcoin community. So strong that we actuallysponsor Nascar with DogeCoin – a cryptocurrency based on a dog meme.Bitcoiners are also a really cool, forward-thinking, humanitarian-oriented group of people. Some of us are very interested in dismantling old, archaic , even dysfunctional systems that do not serve humanity. We would rather work to create a better world for us all.Bitcoiners came together to support Sean’s Outpost nicely, and we also showed our true colours in fundraising for that fat cheque given to wrongfully-accused Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto. From my point of view, ‘Hardcore Bitcoiners’ appear to believe in ending war, doing no harm, and in living and let live. And we just love supporting a good cause.And our beloved Bitcoin has many functions, two of which include peer-to-peer charitable donations and the ability to micro-pay/tip.Mat Cyrulo, founder of social-tipping application Cryptiv, agrees with the YouTube Cat video + social tipping power combination. “If Egyptian Pharaohs had smartphones and YouTube, they would have probably posted cat videos, too,” he laughs. “Cats are a metaphor for a unique form of Internet culture. Reddit loves cats so much, it’s crazy. The Internet also has a unique language, (meme, lulz.) [Now]… we have a currency that will let the people of the Internet join forces when they feel that something needs to be done.”So, if we enable microtipping on YouTube videos and other online content, and allowed viewers, or even likers, to ‘tip’ their way directly into a Humane Society’s wallet, we could finally solve this ongoing cat-population problem.But Mat doesn’t see this restricted to YouTube tipping. “Using Cryptiv, you can send a donation to a humane society over Twitter. Everyone who follows you sees that Tweet. You look like a nice gal/guy to your followers. Or, if you spend 5 hours making a cat meme/video and you donate all the tips to the humane society, you look like a hero.”“Thus,” he continues, “ we achieve multiple things: entertaining people, and getting social gratification from our work, and promoting a cause we love/care about.”Louis CK had great success with this type of fundraising activity: he produced a video, posted it online and asked for donations, and made “more than he could have with HBO.” Mat continues with a RadioHead example: “They released their album online via ‘pay what you can’ and made more money than their last album.”The key here is that – with crypto – the sums of money can now be any size. “It was impossible to send a penny before, and now you can send a fraction of a penny via a social cue. Pennies can be powerful when there are enough of them,” says Mat.Imagine the possibilities of including a micropayment tip-application like Cryptiv or ChangeTip to YouTube. Every time you watch Ninja Cat, or show Grumpy Cat off to your friend, you can tip .01 cent. Or .05. Or even .25. Whatever! It’s really nothing for us who have the luxury of time and ability to laugh at cat videos or memes, and it’s totally worth it, because if we all do it, that number adds up. That .01 c (equivalent in bitcoin, or perhaps Kittehcoin/CatCoin), is transferred directly to a local humane society or animal shelter. This activity amounts to some massive money.Take the numbers generated by NyanCat, for example. This pop-tart bodied cat who flies happily through a rainbow, while singing the same song forever got a whopping +112,000,000 views. And that’s just the count on one of his/her/its many videos. If the video linked directly to a Humane Society’s wallet, and every viewer spent .01c to enjoy NyanCat’s epic journey, direct charitable givings would have amounted to over $1,000,o00.00 dollars. How far do you think shelters around the world can go with any extra money, let alone a million dollars? From people enjoying an animated poptart cat?And that’s just the social tipping side. With our direct peer-to-peer technology, we now know that every bit of charitable donation (tip) we are sending is going to a wallet that is in the hands of a humane society. We can see it.Bitcoin is financial empowerment. It enables communities to come together online and pool our resources to make massive change. Those of us who agree that animal abuse is completely unnecessary, let alone in this day and age, can now make this happen using Bitcoin. Soon, YouTube will have micro-tipping options for popular content. YouTube content creators can still earn their significant advertising revenue, so no one loses; indeed, cats win, cat video/content creators win, YouTube wins, and we as an evolved species win.What can we do? Educate, educate, educate. Find your local animal shelter. Determine for yourself if it’s run up to snuff, and if you would feel good giving them money. Teach them about Bitcoin. Create a wallet for them – or better yet, have them go through the process of creating their own wallet with you there. Empower them.Then reach out to content creators and educate them, too. Help them install a social tipping tool, or just paste the QR code to the shelter’s wallet on their YouTube page. Educate them on why this is good, and what it will do. Heck, they clearly already love cats enough to make videos about them! People love to laugh, and as Ethan Buchman of CoinCulture says, “the best way to raise money for charitable causes is by making a joke out of it.” If Potato Salad has taught us anything, it’s that people feel more open to sending money to things that make them laugh.If this is indeed true, these cats are going to be billionaires.Tip me below if you enjoyed this article!",

    "text": "Centuries ago the term “Philosopher” was defined as: those that sought for the truth in all things. The prophesied Philosopher’s Stone is not a stone at all. The term “stone” is used metaphorically much like bitcoin is not actually a coin. It is claimed, in ancient legends, to be the source of enormous wealth and contains the ability to extend life itself. Legends that speak of this mysterious substance are found in many cultures by various names dating back to the time of antiquity. The life-long quest for its discovery has consumed many centuries. Countless lifetimes were spent in the quest of its discovery, second only to the quest for the Holy Grail. Are the legends and clues held in volumes of centuries-old manuscripts only an illusion? Or is it possible that there are hints of truth or science buried inside?Hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of the best scientific minds throughout the last thousand years spent much of their efforts in pursuit of the Philosopher’s Stone. The first mention of the stone has been traced back over 2,000 years ago. A documentary episode from the series Decoding the Past was presented by The History Channel in 2006 called “The Real Sorcerer’s Stone”. Several experts were interviewed regarding the legend including Professor Lawrence M. Principe from the Johns Hopkins University, who said:“Think about someone who can make gold. They could rule the world and tear down old social and political structures.”Professor Principe also explained that the legend told of the unbelievable quality that could extend the life of anybody who consumes even a part of it.The ScientistsHistory credits Sir Isaac Newton for inventing calculus, defining the first laws of physics and inventing the first reflecting telescope. This was in addition to being in charge of the Royal Society, the Master of the British Mint and creating a new fixed gold standard for currency and world-wide commerce. Not as commonly known was that he also secretly dedicated an even greater portion of his life (by some accounts over one million words) to the discovery of the Philosopher’s Stone using the secret science of alchemy. In this, he joins a long list of some of the brightest scientists of his day. This discovery was made, perhaps ironically, by the father of Keynesian Economics – John Maynard Keynes. He purchased Newton’s volumes in the 1930s. The relatively secret non-published works relating to Newton’s efforts in alchemy were hidden away by the Royal Society over a century earlier.The mystery scientist of the modern era credited with creation of the Bitcoin protocol and network as well as bitcoin the currency is known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. There seems to be no indication that he was trying to create or discover the Philosopher’s Stone. The theory of why the name Satoshi Nakamoto was used was explained by computer scientist, Ted Nelson. Satoshi in Japan means “clear thinking wise”. Naka is “ inside” and Moto is “foundation”. In total, Nelson interprets the name as: “I am one who sees in depth”.Alchemy – The Cryptography of the PastWith the discovery of elements and metal mixing, concoctions of every sort were combined chemically, and the legend of the Philosopher’s Stone evolved into the idea of turning lead, iron and copper into gold. Through the gained knowledge of these activities and processes, alchemy became the precursor of modern chemistry and the scientific method. Many believe the science field of chemistry today owes its existence to the quest for the Philosopher’s Stone.The kings and government leaders in centuries past were fearful that if the Philosopher’s Stone were to be created it could devalue or destabilize not only their own currency and riches, but could also disrupt the value of all commerce. Because of this, they outlawed the research and the practice moved underground, but continued. Although at this same time, many of the same rulers secretly hired alchemists to create the Philosopher’s Stone for themselves. Finding the recipe was considered to be the Magnum Opus or “Greatest work” of one’s lifetime.As alchemists were creating mixtures and compounds that hadn’t existed before, their powers were seen by the common people to be magic. As in all things deriving from the nature of man – there were good and benevolent men who created medicines and advanced the science, but there were also scammers, tricksters and poisonous murderers who used some of their knowledge for dark pursuits of the occult.Because of the restrictions by governments, the scientists communicated with each other in code and riddles. This was the cryptography of their day. They also communicated in allegory stories and symbolism. These symbols preceded the table of elements.Cryptocurrency – The Alchemist of TodayIn the modern era, the financial cryptologists have similar goals: the power to create wealth that must be done in secret because those in power would be fearful of the loss of their power over money. Cryptologists communicate in secret using codes as well. They applied and bettered their tradecraft for 25 years. Essentially what the cryptocurrency creators sought was the technology and formula to create gold 2.0 based on cryptography. The ability to harness this technology is essentially the modern day Philosopher’s Stone – although they may not have realized it in those terms at the time.Crypto Currency “alchemists” would include Adam Beck , David Chaum and Nick Szabo among others. They also wrote in riddled coded language called C++ and PGP that few understand outside their exclusive community. Governments are extremely concerned about the ability of cryptography and those who practice it as it exposes their dirty secrets. The arts and knowledge of cryptography allowed Edward Snowden and Julian Assang to expose unpleasant truths about secret government abilities.Some governments of the world are still fearful that digital currencies such as “Gold 2.0” could make their national currencies devalued. Is there a parallel from today’s leaders to those of the ancient past? Could bitcoin disrupt government currencies in ways that parallel the ancient? Is this just simply history repeating itself or do these actions and reactions transcend through time?Alchemy TableIs Bitcoin Really the New Gold?Bitcoin is commonly compared to gold and holds many advantages. It has economically intrinsic qualities that go far beyond that of the relative uselessness of gold itself as it can be used all over the world and can be publicly accountable. Bitcoin currency has so many common qualities of gold that it is often called the ‘digital gold’, or even more commonly, ‘gold 2.0’.Bitcoin can be used by anybody with an internet connection to conduct private transactions with anybody else in the world. If required, it can be used discreetly from governments’ control in the ways alchemists of old continued the science while staying out of government interference in countries that required discretion. Digital currencies that adhere to the core principles of bitcoin are increasingly viewed as the future of money. Digital currency may outlast and transcend those governments that would try to ban it as more people discover the freedom from personal privacy invasion. The power described for a Philosopher’s Stone may be more powerful than any one government can control. But like the old scammers and tricksters that used alchemy to remove people from their wealth, bitcoin too has had the same kinds of unscrupulous people that will attempt defraud owners of bitcoin. Some things never change.How is bitcoin created? Where is the magic? Strictly speaking bitcoin is added into existence as an incentive to those running the computer hardware that processes and collectively verifies all of the transactions on the world-wide network. The hardware that does this is transferring energy and electricity by using incredible computing power to maintain the network and in effect create gold 2.0. The computer hardware is constructed with circuits, on motherboards using copper connections inside metal cases. Most of the typical computer is derived from iron, copper and other base metals. In this, one might argue that it continues to fit the descriptions of legend.Peter Marshall, historian and author of the book entitled “The Philosopher’s Stone”, describes the prophecy regarding the location of the Philosopher Stone as “being everywhere and nowhere at once”. If asked today where bitcoin exists – could there be a better answer? He also says it is complex enough for the smartest men, but simple enough to be considered child’s play. Programming bitcoin took incredible brain power, yet any child can click “buy with bitcoin” on a web browser to use it. Do current scientific beliefs and the laws of matter and motion make such quests for the Philosopher’s Stone now seem silly?Could the ancient prophecy predicting the Philosopher’s Stone be true? Did Satoshi Nakamoto discover or unknowingly create the Philosopher’s Stone after most of the world quit believing in ancient legends? Bitcoin surely can’t be THE Philosopher’s Stone because it lacks the other vital ability listed in the ancient text: the ability to extend life, right? As was mentioned before, even one small part of it could extend one’s life. That of course could never happen with bitcoin.Except… it did.On August 28, 2014 –Hal Finney was declared legally dead. An early bitcoin supporter and adopter, he spent (consumed) some of his early mined bitcoin to purchase equipment and storage needed to put his dying body into cryopreservation. His intention is to be awoken once a cure for ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease) is found, thereby extending his life.Hal made many contributions to the computing world and bitcoin in general during his life. Did his final action complete the final requirement that would allow us to know and recognize bitcoin as the Philosopher’s Stone? Did fate set his destiny so the Philosopher’s Stone prophecy could be fulfilled?Could one predict the ramifications of the possible connection between The Philosopher’s Stone and bitcoin if word of this spreads through a Twitter viral firestorm? Has the nature of human emotion and desire for wealth changed that much in the last 2,000 years? If only one in a thousand people find this theory plausible, the resulting rush to own a piece of the legendary Philosopher’s Stone would create a world-wide historic event remembered throughout the ages. Would the insatiable desire of people to behold the promises of the Philosopher’s Stone be much different today than the last 2,000 years?People will believe what they choose to believe and follow that which gives them hope. Even the most skeptical, which might view these connections and observations as ridiculous and would put no faith in fate, prophecy or legends…might pause and consider how many of Earth’s seven billion people might get a tingle in their spine and will choose to believe. After all, that’s how money itself works.We believe.",

    "text": "This is a guest post by Ben BestAustrian Economists are harsh critics of government central banks (such as the Federal Reserve System of the United States – a name intended to obscure its role as a central bank, unlike the Bank of England). Austrian Economists can also be very critical of fractional reserve banking, the practice of lending money in greater quantity than the amount of deposits. For these reasons, Austrian Economists could be expected to be enthusiastic supporters of Bitcoin. Unfortunately, this is usually not the case.Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin in particular, presents a formidable challenge to the world-wide socialism by which governments control the means of production of money. The ferociousness with which the US government defends its monopoly on money could be demonstrated by the 2011 sentencing of the producer of Liberty Dollars (coins made of precious metals that could be exchanged as commodities) to 15 years in jail ― accusing him of “domestic terrorism”.Someone attending a Bitcoin conference could be shocked at the widespread acceptance of Austrian Economics among Bitcoin enthusiasts ― in sharp contrast to the situation in governments and universities. Yet the majority of Austrian Economists not only don’t appreciate Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, they are very critical. There was barely a mention of Bitcoin at the 2014 Austrian Economics Research Conference. Three negative articles about Bitcoin appeared in the Mises Daily articles of the Austrian Economics Mises Institute over a year ago:The Money-ness of BitcoinsBitcoin: Money of the Future or Old-Fashioned Bubble?The Bitcoin Money MythNo more has appeared on the subject of Bitcoin in Mises Daily since that time. I believe these articles contain many erroneous arguments, which I wish to address.The major objection to Bitcoin by Austrian Economists seems to revolve around whether Bitcoin is money. The claim by many Austrian Economists is that money can only arise from what is the most saleable or marketable commodity: the so-called “regression theorem” of Austrian Economics.There is certainly truth to the claim that money has historically arisen from commodities, but that is history, and cannot be used as a litmus test for money-ness. What matters is whether the reputed money can be used as a medium of exchange. But if an original commodity value for Bitcoin needs to be specified in order to regard it as money, I would speculate that some computer techies placed a value on Bitcoin as being a breakthrough in money technology. And computer techies enjoy being early adopters. The commodity value that these early adopters gave to Bitcoin led to an exchange value for other people who did not have the original commodity value preferences.That would be a strained argument to justify Bitcoin in terms of the regression theorem. Although it is hard for most economists to imagine a medium of exchange not arising from a highly liquid commodity, I believe that Bitcoin started out as an invention intended to be a new form of money. New technologies require new ideas, which in this case should mean a reexamination of the regression theorem.Precious metals became money largely because they are the most corrosion-resistant materials ― as well as because of rarity and divisibility. Gold and silver became highly marketable because of these features rather than the opposite: that gold and silver became money because they were highly marketable. For most of human history the bulk of humanity has been more interested in food and shelter as marketable commodities than in jewelry or works of art in precious metals. The bulk of humanity would not have such interest in the “beauty” of precious metals to make those metals highly marketable were it not for their use as money. Austrian Economists recognize that value is subjective, so the subjective valuation computer techies had for Bitcoin should count for no less than the valuation of the beauty of precious metals by those wealthy enough to acquire luxury goods. Neither precious metals nor cryptocurrency can have an objective intrinsic value apart from the subjective valuations of some group of humans. Any group of humans can decide whether to use something as commodity.Precious metals are bulky and inconvenient to use, which is why people have preferred paper certificates for precious metals. Sadly, the convenience of paper over precious metals led to fractional reserve banking, and ultimately to the fiat currencies used as money today.Does the “regression theorem” justify the money-ness of fiat currencies? Fiat currencies are “backed” by legal tender laws ― by government guns and prisons. The argument that money must be material cannot even be justified by reference to paper currency and coins. Paper currency and coins account for no more than a tenth of American fiat money. Monetary transactions involving fiat money are dominated by checks, credit cards, and online payments. Paper money and coins may well become completely obsolete in the coming decades as financial transactions become increasingly digital. The US government now only allows businesses to pay their taxes electronically ― even checks have become obsolete for this purpose.The Money-ness of BitcoinIs Bitcoin money? With Bitcoin you can purchase airline tickets (from Virgin Atlantic), hotel bookings (from Expedia), automobiles (from Tesla), electronics (from Tiger Direct), as well as products from tens of thousands of other merchants. Admittedly, most of these merchants will very quickly convert the bitcoins obtained in the transactions to fiat. Some Austrian Economists have also claimed that Bitcoin cannot be money because it is not a “final means of payment”. Other Austrian Economists argue that being a medium-of-exchange is not a sufficient condition for being money. I have been more persuaded by the latter argument.The US Dollar value of all outstanding bitcoins is currently about $8 billion. Numerous immigrants send bitcoins instantly to their relatives overseas, thereby avoiding the 10-15 bank fees and the five day delays of bank wires. These immigrants purchase bitcoins as a commodity to reduce their transaction costs, just as someone might buy a cash register to reduce transaction costs. Actually, for immigrants who are unbanked, there may be no alternative means of transferring their money abroad. Such fiat currencies as the Moldovan leu, the Ethiopian birr, and the Vanuatu vatu can’t compare to Bitcoin in terms of world-wide use and acceptance as money.But it isn’t only immigrants who use Bitcoin to reduce transaction costs. The investment banker/Austrian Economist Peter Schiff was a harsh critic of Bitcoin in 2013: My Open Letter to Peter Schiff.But Schiff became a Bitcoin enthusiast in 2014 after discovering that Bitcoin could save him transaction costs in his business. And some people acquire bitcoins for reasons other than to reduce transaction costs or simplify transactions, such as for contracts, to implementother cryptocurrencies, etc.The claim that Bitcoin cannot be money because it is too technology-dependent is also fallacious. Credit cards are technology-dependent, yet are now more widely used for financial transactions than paper currency. Half of the financial transactions in the African country of Kenya are by means of the cell-phone-based M-Pesa. Cell phones have become universal. People throughout the “underdeveloped world” have cell phones, despite having no bank account, no credit card, and no credit rating. When smartphones become universal in a few years, Bitcoin will be easily accessible worldwide.In my opinion, the underlying reason many Austrian Economists are hostile to Bitcoin is because they are “gold bugs”. In my opinion these Austrian Economists are not much better than the Keynesians who insist that money must be fiat so that central banks can manipulate interest rates. In a market economy it is the market that chooses optimal solutions. If legal tender laws are repealed, the market will determine the best medium of exchange ― which could be precious metals, a basket of commodities, Bitcoin, or some other cryptocurrency. But Bitcoin may emerge as money even without legal tender laws.Austrian Economists for BitcoinTo give credit where credit is due, there are some Austrian Economists who are very pro-Bitcoin, and their number is increasing. Jeffrey Tucker was initially skeptical, but has since become an enthusiastic promoter (as anyone can see who looks at his Liberty.ME website. Two other erudite pro-Bitcoin Austrian Economists are Peter Surda and Konrad Graf. The most representative article by Peter Surda is “The origin, classification and utility of Bitcoin,” and the most representative article by Konrad Graf is “On the origins of Bitcoin: Stages of monetary evolution.” These Austrian Economists argue that the anti-Bitcoin Austrian Economists don’t understand the regression theorem.In the early stages of Bitcoin, bitcoins were accumulated by the developers as part of their experimentation, becoming something of a status symbol of points in a computer game or website, but with the intention of possibly becoming a medium-of-exchange. That intention eventually led to attempts to use bitcoins for that purpose. As such attempts increased, so did the liquidity. Liquidity is a prerequisite for becoming a medium-of-exchange.Graf compares bitcoins achieving commodity value starting as a status symbol to the historical evolution of money from beads on a necklace and later gold and silver. These items did not have much value apart from durability and beauty, but eventually became valued for their use as media-of-exchange. This argument is quite distinct from the justification of bitcoins as having commodity value because of reducing transaction costs — a commodity value which is unrelated to the regression theorem (emergence of bitcoins as commodity to bitcoins as media-of-exchange).I think that both the anti-Bitcoin Austrian Economists and pro-Bitcoin Austrian Economists contort themselves too much in their efforts to justify the regression theorem as it relates to Bitcoin. The Austrian Economist Murray N. Rothbard explains the regression theorem in Chapter 5 of his great book MAN, ECONOMY, AND STATE, which include the following passage:Demand for a good as a medium of exchange must be predicated on a previously existing array of prices in terms of other goods. A medium of exchange can therefore originate only according to our previous description and the foregoing diagram; it can arise only out of a commodity previously used directly in a barter situation, and therefore having had an array of prices in terms of other goods. Money must develop out of a commodity with a previously existing purchasing power, such as gold and silver had. It cannot be created out of thin air by any sudden “social compact” or edict of government.Although an argument can be made that bitcoins gained value as experimental tokens and status symbols, I think the “barter” history of Bitcoin (starting with the May 22, 2010 pizza purchase for 10,000 bitcoins) was highly motivated by a “social compact” amongst a community of computer geeks who had a prospective medium-of-exchange, wanted it to become a medium-of-exchange, and played with it as a medium-of-exchange until it became a medium of exchange. I think it is incorrect to say that Bitcoin arose from a commodity as Rothbard would describe it. Bitcoin is not something Rothbard or the earlier Austrian Economists could have imagined.I have been irritated by the claim that bitcoins are a medium-of-exchange, but are not money. I now accept Graf’s definition of money as “the most liquid good in a given society context” and thereby used as a unit of account (basis of pricing goods). Even in cyberspace, fiat currencies are the ultimate unit of pricing — bitcoin unit pricing is still derived from fiat pricing.A Free Market in MoneyBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and therefore currently has market dominance. But Bitcoin has flaws which many of the newer cryptocurrencies have corrected, such as the concentration mining amongst those with ASIC computers (and low electricity costs), the ten-minute confirmation time, the public block chain, the declining reward for mining, the “waste” of electricity associated with proof-of-work, etc. Let the market choose the preferred medium of exchange. Competition among types of money will allow for the most efficient medium of exchange. That may happen whether or not legal tender laws are repealed and the socialist/fascist control of money can be ended.I would not deny that cryptocurrencies have problems that need to be resolved before they can be more widely used as money, but this is understandable insofar as the technology is new. The status of cryptocurrencies has justly been compared with the status of the Internet in the 1990s. The American government tried to treat cryptography as a restricted munition subject to government regulation, but the demands of online commerce and government ineffectuality at control predominated. Cryptocurrency prices are currently too volatile for them to function well as a medium of exchange, and the technology for making loans with cryptocurrencies has not been well-developed. Such problems will likely be resolved.Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies cannot be eradicated by government prohibition any more than prohibition of alcohol prevented the use of alcohol. Unlike Liberty Dollar, there is no central responsible agency for governments to attack if they wish to ban cryptocurrencies. Making cryptocurrency ownership illegal would be much more difficult than was the case when gold ownership was made illegal. The major vulnerability for cryptocurrencies lies in the exchanges: the financial institutions that exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies. Exchanges cannot operate legally without government licenses. Until there is more widespread commerce in cryptocurrency, most people will acquire their money as fiat, and must purchase cryptocurrency with the fiat. The other major vulnerability is taxation. Current Internal Revenue Service regulations treat cryptocurrencies as equities subject to capital gain tax. Cryptocurrencies may be forced to evolve underground or overseas before they can prevail openly in the United States.I am hopeful that cryptocurrency will eventually displace fiat money. I believe that this will happen first in countries of the “underdeveloped world” where central banks engage in the most reckless inflationary policies. I believe that cryptocurrency will displace the US Dollar and the Euro as a world reserve currency. Eventually governments of “developed countries” will have no choice but to repeal legal tender laws, abandon the fascism of central banking, and succumb to the new world of money.I am also hopeful that Austrian Economists can learn to appreciate the extent to which cryptocurrencies represent an unexpected and unprecedented challenge to central banking and fractional reserve banking. I am hopeful that Austrian Economists will begin to see how cryptocurrencies vindicate the principles of Austrian Economics. The cryptocurrency community is looking to Austrian Economics as an inspiration for their practices. I hope that Austrian Economists can be convinced to assume intellectual leadership, rather than be reactionary naysayers. The arguments are straightforward, but too many Austrian Economists contort themselves trying to decide if Bitcoin is a commodity or are too attached to gold to appreciate how much technology can transform the world.",

    "text": "Late last month BitScan launched their new mobile applications, including a revamp of the company’s popular iOS application. The app is completely redesigned and streamlined for speed. Furthermore, in response to customer demand, the BitScan team has also launched a mobile application for Android. This launch comes months after the company began its crowd-funding of the Android version, which reached a third of the way to its goal in just five days in early March.BitScan provides one of the largest Bitcoin directories and currently consists of over 6,000 merchants in more than 130 countries. The company believes that the continued promotion of Bitcoin commerce is key to the mainstream adoption of the virtual currency. In the months previous, BitScan has been focused on the development of their mobile platforms and website, designing them to support efficiency, speed and scalability for their users.BitScan for Android was released on March 25 and much like the iOS application, provides users a source for Bitcoin news, and a location based Bit Trade Map and Bit Trade Listing platform. The release of the Android version of BitScan was supported by the company’s ambitious product development schedule that began earlier this year. They invested heavily in back-end technology and re-organized their data behind a REST API (representational state transfer), which has caused huge gains in application performance and made for a simpler user interface.Within the application is Bit Buzz, a bitcoin news source which allows users to keep up with news regarding virtual currency from their mobile device. These stories are displayed in a very mobile friendly manner and contain valuable information into the cryptocurrency community – for both the basic and advanced user.By far one of the best parts of BitScan’s mobile application is the Bit Trade Map. This interactive map provides pinpoint locations of Bitcoin merchants throughout the world and is as easy to use as other mobile-based map applications. In addition, users can also use the zoom function to explore every merchant around the world, which is perhaps the most eye-opening part of the application. Seeing the blue Bitcoin icons of the 6,000+ merchants gives a glimpse into just how large the Bitcoin community has become since its humble beginnings years ago. The application takes into account the user’s location and finds businesses and service providers in their area that accept Bitcoin. When the user finds the business, they can research their findings in further detail with a simple finger press. BitScan also provides users with contact information for each merchant, including phone, email and website.Furthermore, the Bit Trade Listing feature allows users to see the same details contained on the Bit Trade Map, only in list form. The list is sorted by the merchant nearest to the user’s location and still provides further information on each merchant when pressed.BitScan has a robust and scalable foundation in place, and has achieved a large grasp on the mobile market. From this, the company will shift its focus to adding additional tools to succeed in their vision of promoting Bitcoin commerce around the world. “Counterparty trust is, understandably, a big issue in the bitcoin space,” said Rob Wilson, CEO of BitScan in a recent company press release. “While multi-signature technology will, once commercially implemented go some way to reducing the trust component in consumers’ spending decisions, Bitcoin needs a means by which merchants can establish, build and demonstrate their trust credentials up-front. BitScan is working hard to provide them with the means of doing so.”To download the application on both Android and iOS, simply search “BitScan” in the respective app-store.",

    "text": "This story originally appeared in Bitcoin MagazineIssue 21.“Without art, the crudeness of reality would make the world unbearable.” -George Bernard ShawArt is an undeniable feature of society. They have always been a part of our humanity. Unlike sciences, which have predictable laws, art is human expression. Limitless, and inspirational. Art has the power to move humans into action… or inaction. Art can also be a commentary on our current human conditioning, leaving a mark on society.Yet these marks are largely funded and arguably controlled by the elite – wealthy families, foundations, and galleries – the ‘patrons of the arts.’ Artists must find a way to remain true to their forms of truth without offending those who put food in their mouths. Both Michelangelo Buonarroti and Pablo Picasso were backed by powerful patrons, yet simultaneously rebelled against the establishment: despite his patrons’ wishes to leave the Pieta unsigned, Michelangelo snuck into St. Peter’s Basilica and graffitied on the sculpture “Michelangelo Buonarroti, Florentine, made it.” And Picasso repeatedly offended his patrons through his crude paintings. Mark Rothko of the New York School, an artist who created works about despair and the human condition, defied what his critics and patrons defined as art, and ultimately took his life in a final snub to the establishment.The average salary for an artist in America is roughly $44,000 a year, a fact that challenges the concept of the modern-day ‘starving artist.’ Critics of this concept must still consider the immense expenses involved in the production of art; in fine art’s case, there’s the cost of materials, marketing, exhibitions, selling space, insurance, shipping, gallery fees and, of course, time. Then consider the costs associated with other forms of art, like dancing: shoes, training, costumes, travel… or music production and performance: instruments, equipment, audio engineering, performing… And then, of course, art is distributed through established platforms like iTunes and art galleries, which take 30 and 50, respectively.What about government grants? Don’t governments provide financial resources – like grants – to aid artists and allow them to focus full-time on their art? These grants are both slow to award funding and, depending on the government in power, funding is often taken away from art styles that those in power deem ‘inappropriate’ and undeserving of government funds. In Canada, Bill C-10 included a provision that would allow the government to refuse tax credits to film and television productions that are ‘contrary to public policy’. What does that include, really? Who defines public policy? Unfortunately, when you’re giving out the money, you make the rules. For reasons like this, it is argued that a separation between Art and State must exist. Without it, pure, creative art cannot flourish. But artists need the funding to even produce. So what are their options, here?In search for alternative, artists find new space on the internet; its emergence has broadened the support of myriad styles of visual art, including street, underground, performance, interactive, contemporary and traditional. This shift into the digital world allows artists to connect with individuals all over the world. However, it is argued that this shift, although fantastic for increasing access to potential buyers, limits the intimacy that truly makes art unique. Y.T., a prominent figure in the bitcoin art world, defines art as “the process of creation and the experience between an audience and a creative work.” “Art”, she continues, is “more than an object or performance; it is the space between; an attribution of the wetware.”Right now, artists are stuck. It seems like they can only exist in the physical space by taking funding from their patrons. Otherwise, they flock to the internet, where they may access more funding, but the experience of their art is diminished.A new option presents itself with the emergence of Bitcoin – one that combines the digital world with the physical world, one that could allow artists to stay in the expensive in-person world of galleries without relying on the restrictive demands of modern day patrons. The fact that we can now move small amounts of money around – a phenomenon called ‘social tipping’ – may tip the scales in favour of artists. We – ‘the people’ – may now be able to collectively fund our artists!Right now, we cannot tip artists $1, because it would cost $1.50 in fees through Interac e-money transfer, and we would need their e-mail address, a password, etc. And we can’t pay them through credit card. What would that look like, traveling from painting to painting and swiping our card for $.25 for every piece we like? Bitcoin changes this. Now we can use our phones to scan a unique code and send small payments directly to the artists whose work we enjoy.Social tipping is already alive and well with regards to online content and on Twitter. In his most recent interview with Joe Rogan, Bitcoin evangelist and expert Andreas Antonopoulos discusses his experience with being tipped on the popular social platform: “I take tips on twitter. And without knowing these people, they can send me a quarter, or ten cents, over Twitter. Instantly. and you can’t even do that with any other payment system because it costs so much…” We saw the power of this when Joe Rogan flashed his wallet’s QR code, and the tips started pouring in.Can this integration of QR codes, facilitating micropayments, change the funding of artwork and keep it in the physical sphere so we can experience it? Can we remove art from the hands of the elite and fund artists – through the volume of small payments or ‘tips’ – and have the masses fund them? Or is this just a dream? If we do start incorporating QR codes on our art, will this lead to us putting QR codes on everything, thus monetizing our human experience?When it comes to art, galleries absorb real estate and management fees in order to provide wall space to artists. Cory Peeke, Art Professor at Eastern Oregon University and Director of Nightingale Gallery, would welcome direct tips to artists via QR codes, as long as “the code not be overly obvious or disruptive.” He continues, “my worry would be that the code somehow distracts from the work. This is along the same line of concern I have with artists who insist on large labels, or those who insist on signing their work in a large, obnoxious way … it appears too desperate.”Peeke acknowledges that the territory is new and evolving, but “supports options for artists to make a profit from their work and seek monetary support, even from people who cannot afford to purchase the work.” As long as social tipping does not remove the eventual purchase of the work, or detract from the experience of it, Peeke appears encouraging. This feedback is positive, and offers a win-win-win: people can enjoy the artwork, the artist can create two streams of revenue, and the gallery still gets paid for their efforts.Troy Fearnow, owner of Cryptoart, says that the concept of social tipping and art seem to be in line with consumer motivation. During his company’s pre-launch at the Texas Bitcoin Conference, many people suggested the idea of social tipping through QR codes as he introduced the company’s aesthetic fine art paper wallets. “Some of the ideas were quite interesting,” he reflects. “Imagine a museum that was purely funded by attendees tipping on donated works. It would provide valuable metrics as to what the public wants to see. The concept could be taken a step further by requiring a certain amount to be spent in lieu of an admission fee.”Currently, artists around the world are attracted to the promises of Bitcoin. Like art, the protocol transcends borders. Fearow worked with Ukrainian artist Alexander Fedosov to create the debut images for Cryptoart. Cryptoart publishes aesthetic paper wallets that function as a double-investment: a purchase that allows bitcoin to appreciate along with the art it is stored in. Theoretically, bitcoin acts as a deflationary currency and store of value, and art is typically the same, seeing its value increase over time. This combination – a cryptocertificate – offers investors a recession-proof investment that both looks amazing and retains value on two levels. The aesthetic paper wallet hosts a QR code on the back – offering a way for visitors or onlookers to transfer value to the art-bearer’s wallet. The cover of this magazine is a social experiment into the power of QR codes and art: if you enjoy the cover, tip Alexander Fedosov and let him know. In this work, Fedosov portrays the ancient greek goddess Hecate, which throughout history has been associated with crossroads. It’s meant to allegorize Ukraine as it’s forced to choose between western and eastern worlds. Fedosov is particularly affected, as he is in close proximity to Russian forces.Can we use micropayments to change the ‘starving artist’ problem? It appears that bitcoin offers us a way to socially fund our artists, removing their reliance on governments and the financial elite. This could be a chance to bring the ‘power back to the people’ and allow us to support artistic aspects of our culture. Can this bring the power back to the people and support the artistic aspect of our cultures? We bitcoiners have already shown the world how we collectively can transform charitable attempts and injustices, as shown through our support of Sean’s Outpost and Dorian Nakamoto.Can we transform art, too?",

    "text": "What is Bitcoin, and why do you care?Bitcoin is freedom for money.Let me explain: Bitcoin is third “democratization” that I’ve had the privilege of living through.The first was the Internet of course, the democratization of communication. No longer did you need a printing press, runners, trucks, call boys in order to make your voice heard. Now all you needed is WordPress and a good story. Look at Matt Drudge. He has singlehandedly revolutionized political reporting. His influence is at times stronger than the New York Times. And it’s just him and an assistant and a very, very simple website.The second democratization is 3d printing, or “additive manufacturing”. It is the democratization of manufacturing and its in full swing. You no longer need a factory to make a product. You can already manufacture in plastic from your desk. In less than 10 years you’ll be able to do it in metal, in color with moving parts.Bitcoin is the third democratization, the democratization of money. Right now, your money, the money you worked for, saved and earned isn’t really yours. The banks charge you fees for holding it (and sometimes lose it). Governments have confiscated it at times (remember Cyprus?). If you want to move it, there are restrictions as to how much and when, and if you want to spend large amounts of it, you must account for how you got it.Bitcoin, and crypto currencies in general solve this problem. They are in essence a “trusted distributed public transaction ledger”. Imagine a hotel register. Guests sign in, date, room, etc … That is a transaction ledger. Distributed means that the machines that process that ledger, the “book” if you will, are spread throughout the world with many different ownership hands so that it is very, very difficult for them to collaborate to cheat. Public, because it is open for anyone to inspect.And trusted, because that is the most important thing of all. Do I trust that you really have the money? That you haven’t spent it already, maybe even a second ago? Ensuring all of that is what the “mining” machines really do. The miners are the unseen heroes of Bitcoin. Without miners there is no coin.The adoption of Bitcoin will drastically reduce the amount of financial control anyone can exert over your money. And without that control they can’t tax you and if they can’t tax you they can’t control you. They know this, they are scared and they should be.With Bitcoin there are no borders to money. It flows as easily as water from a spilled cup upsetting the plans of the bankers to monitor, control, restrict, tax and otherwise devalue YOUR money.Bitcoin is freedom for money. Switch to Bitcoin, free your money.",

    "title": "Researching all things bitcoin thoroughly for the last two years has led me to come across several occurrences of articles",
    "text": "Researching all things bitcoin thoroughly for the last two years has led me to come across several occurrences of articles referring to bitcoin as a “Libertarian wet-dream”. It is commonly referred to this way in several blogs, forums, computer technical websites and even some professional economic journals. The expression is now so pervasive that a Google search brings up seemingly countless instances for your linking pleasure. Perhaps it is now time for a journalistic undercover investigation to confirm the phenomenon is indeed a new epidemic. If the connection between bitcoin and wet-dreams is established we my ask ourselves – could wet-dreaming also happen with owners of litecoin or other alternative currencies? Is it safe for one to ask – “Is anyone safe”? The topic of bitcoin has been covered extensively in most other angles, but in the name of science it seems, nobody can yet answer the questions of “what happens to bitcoin when you sleep”?Wet-dreams should be taken seriously. Treating the medical condition is not generally supported by health insurance. As such, it may be time to take matters into your own hands. The emotional scarring that can result from wet-dreams cannot be dismissed out of hand. In previous generations even castration was one remedy. If the link is made, is anybody safe going out of town to a bitcoin conference? If you’re a Libertarian and traveling with a buddy – this is no laughing matter.Medical research:Wikipedia defines a wet dream as a spontaneous and unintended orgasm happening while one sleeps at night . Now a wiki site has been created to provide delicate answers sought by those intending to discover the mysterious origins of wet-dreams. If one is inclined, one might even find many useful tips in overcoming the embarrassing affliction that is claimed to have happened at least one time to 80 of males. In short, researchers found likely causes involve overactive hormones and tight clothing that causes unnecessary stimulation. The website makes the point that it is nobody’s fault when it happens and provides a couple of obvious suggestions to avoid the dilemma. Some of the suggestions include sleeping on your back and avoiding spicy foods. Interesting to note, that avoidance of bitcoin – was not listed among the remedies. Other medical journals used by the professionals of the sleep study medical field also failed to distinguish links to the Libertarian political leanings over other political parties of the US.After extensive review of the publicly available medical journals, an established link between bitcoins and wet-dreams was not discovered. In addition, there were no studies found that indicated Libertarians were more likely to experience wet dreams than other political groups. There was no mention of bitcoin in the medical journals as of yet. In an off-the-record discussion with one self-described “medical professional” who wished to remain anonymous at a Colorado “herbal medicine outlet”, advised that there could possibly be accidental induced wet-dreams in the future as an unintended side-effect with related purchase made from altcoins – such as sexcoin, or xxxcoin. Yet it appears wet-dream specialization researchers haven’t penetrated this field of study to include bitcoin yet.As bitcoins are invisible, and dreams are also non-tangible, some may wonder if it might be possible that the commentators making these statements are projecting their own repressed frustrations while dealing with the predicament perhaps still freshly on their minds. One might deduce that they themselves may suffer from the embarrassing affliction which may only seep into the conversation through Freudian suppression. Perhaps they themselves have become subject matter experts of the effects of wet-dreaming but mistakenly associate the troubling condition on their basic lack understanding of bitcoin itself. After careful review of Satoshi’s white paper – the topic of wet-dreams was not a topic under consideration. Troubling for the sufferers, WebMD does not appear to have a support group for like-minded wet-dreamers waiting to embrace them.Having reached a conclusion showing no mention of bitcoin wet-dreams in the current medical journals, further research was conducted into the Libertarian political party. The party platform for the Libertarians can be found on their official website. Contrary to the opinion of some armchair Libertarian experts – they take no official stance on bitcoin. What may perhaps be even more surprising to these commentators… they take no official position on wet-dreams. They do take political donations for bitcoin, along with five different credit cards, cash, and monthly donations.The Wikipedia entry for the Libertarian party lists various members of leadership. The current chairman “Nicholas Sarwark” has issued no opinion of bitcoin. Former Libertarian presidential candidate “Gary Johnson” admitted he knew almost nothing about bitcoin in an interview last year. In this regard, one might think the most famous Libertarian voices would be wet dreaming about bitcoin. Further research into Ron Paul’s website called “Voices of Liberty” search for bitcoin brought up a message: “Nothing Found”. However, interviews found on YouTube indicated he admitted he was still uneducated in the science behind bitcoin. Further searches on YouTube brought up surprising quantity of wet-dream material but unrelated to bitcoin and is not recommended for your independent follow-up. No links have been inserted, so those search results will not be forthcoming.Using common scientific principles, there is also a need to establish a control-group used for a baseline for comparison. As bitcoin is used as a financial payment mechanism, to be truly forthcoming, we should also establish that it does not stand out as uniquely “dry-dreaming” as well. Therefore a comparison was undertaken into any relationship between cash and credit cards causing wet-dreams as well. On the other end of the stick, we must also measure other political parties other than Libertarians for another control-group for consideration. The research looked for a peer-reviewed study which measured the frequency of wet dreamers among various self-identifying Republican, Democrats or Independents. However, the results of this additional research also failed to prove any reliable link establishing strong bonds between the wet-dreamers and their political affiliation. Antidotal evidence for certain unnamed politicians were considered, but ultimately *Bill Clinton* rejected for lack of subpoena-able evidence. Although nowhere else covered, it might be possible to purchase Viagra with bitcoin. If taken before bedtime and without partner – unintended side effects of that lapse in judgement could, in theory, be partially associated on bitcoin for allowing such an non-invasive purchase. Unfortunately for now, the results of successfully finding wet-dreamers with known associations to bitcoins – or politics turned out to be… anticlimactic.For the reader alarmed about the possibility of bitcoin inducing wet-dreams in themselves, the wet-dream prevention website did provide more possible useful tips. First, avoid mixing your Viagra and sleeping pills. Second, the use of a honey mixture (applied by ingesting – not as topical application). Lastly, avoid over-stimulating yourself with financial news and especiallybitcoin news before bedtime. Close the websites you use to track bitcoin’s hourly price movement and try to think about something else… like baseball.The research into the Libertarian to bitcoin to wet-dream link seems to have ended with dead ends on both sides of the equation. The comments and opinions now all appear to be nothing more than premature speculation. The story of proving bitcoins have anything to do with wet-dreams for anybody seems to end with no happy ending.*Author’s note: This was written to be a light-hearted comedic piece on the subject; not to be taken seriously. May your sleepwear remain dry.",

    "text": "So you don’t really know what bitcoin is, which leaves you with two options: research, and not research. Now, like with most things in life, you should always go for the easiest; therefore not research. It’s not like there’s some magical open database of information available to you at all times. And because knowing stuff sucks anyways, I’ve compiled a simple guide to being a bitcoin hater, which will guarantee you feeling better about willingly not knowing things.1. Don’t ever challenge anyone in person. You have, at your pale fingertips, an entire social network of pseudo-human interaction where you need never look anyone in the eye and where you are always right. Start in places like Reddit, Facebook, and YouTube, but if you really don’t have too much to say, Twitter is your friend.2. Be highly suspicious of anyone who likes bitcoin of being a millionaire. Then fill yourself with resentment.3. Be highly offended that there’s an abundance of white people really into bitcoin. Amir Taaki doesn’t count; he’s still half white, therefore racist.4. Remind us all that bitcoin is only used to buy drugs. This is of course a direct insult to your lifestyle because you’re still meeting that kid in the parking lot behind your old school, who makes more money than you do by selling coke cut with baby laxative.5. Safely assume that bitcoin is a fad perpetuated by neck beard hipsters, (but not the ones you hang out with).6. Assert that math, I mean bitcoin, isn’t real.7. Remember: you use your Visa and cash everyday, which makes you an economist. You’ve heard terms like fiat and deflationary, so you have full authority to claim that bitcoin is bad currency.8. Point out the fact that bitcoin will be obsolete when we’re all in FEMA camps!9. Conclude that since bitcoin is baseless in every way, and has a robust community, it must be a cult. Or some kind of club. Or made up of a diversity of people who people know things you don’t. Same thing.10. Although oil was volatile for some 40 odd years, and many things that are terrible have been stable, like the S&P 500 stock market, claim bitcoin is bad due to volatility. Don’t worry, it’ll hold up because if you don’t know anything, then nobody knows anything.11. Demonstrate that you can comfortably subscribe to two contradictory beliefs at once by stating that nothing backs bitcoin, while continuing to use the dollar.12. Resort to name calling:13. Say that Bitcoin is a tulip, Beanie Baby ponzi scheme. And remember, that’s what you think, and you’re never wrong, so you must be, not wrong in this case too.14. Assume that people who like bitcoin think they’re better than you. No, assume that they own bitcoin to be better than you.15. Whether it be in good humor or complete conviction (one can never know), don’t forget to voice that bitcoin is controlled by zionist reptilian shapeshifting overlords.16. If attacking a male, go for things like “you probably still live with your mom.” If female, this may remind you that you haven’t had much experience with osculating curves, so allow you virginal frustrations to fuel angry comments about her appearance. You’ll be surprised at how creative you can be in this state of mind.17. In the very likely event of a killswitch or soft apocalypse, bitcoin would not work. So we might as well not use it now. In fact, let’s go back to trading seeds.18. Argue that because Sha256 was developed by the NSA, and the Internet was invented by DARPA, bitcoin is therefore evil.19. Remember, everyone who uses bitcoin is evading taxes, and you’re better because you’re not.20. Assume things.21. Point out that the government is not sure about bitcoin. And government represents us, so we too should not be sure.22. Mention Ron Paul, because he’s crazy and doesn’t exist, just like bitcoin.23. Completely dismiss what this technology means for the unbanked 6 billion, and continue to point out white privilege because electricity.24. Publicly display that you have no idea what gives money its value.25. Laugh, because it’s a virtue that you truly don’t give a f*k about global innovation.26. If all else fails, blame the Internet.“If you don’t believe me or don’t get it, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry.” – Satoshi 7/29/2010",

    "text": "This article first appeared on page 26 of Issue 21.You probably don't think about Marxism when you think about Bitcoin. To most people, Marx is known as the guy who didn't like private property and capitalism in general. Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency with the ability to encourage markets by breaking down the worldwide barriers created by multiple national currencies, doesn't seem like it has much to do with him. You would probably think that Marx wouldn't like Bitcoin.But I don’t think so. I believe if Marx were around today he would see Bitcoin as an excellent example of his Theory of History in action; a global system, with roots in the crisis’ of capitalism, that will bring the world closer to his utopian ideals.What many people don't know about Marx is that he admired capitalism as a creator of wealth. While he despised the way that it abused the labor of the proletariat (working class), he saw it as a necessary period on the way to socialism and, eventually, communism. He believed in historical materialism, the idea that society is shaped by physical conditions at certain points in history. These physical conditions create an environment for revolutionary changes in human society.If this seems confusing, the best analogy I can draw is with Darwin's theory of evolution. Much like On the Origin of Species sought to explain how biological creatures change over time as a result of their environment, Marx sought to explain the process behind humanity's economic evolution. Marx admired the work of Darwin and thought that his (Darwin's) work created a foundation that he could build on. From his letters:Darwin’s work is most important and suits my purpose in that it provides a basis in natural science for the historical class struggle. One does, of course, have to put up with the clumsy English style of argument. Despite all shortcomings, it is here that, for the first time, ‘teleology’ in natural science is not only dealt a mortal blow but its rational meaning is empirically explained.Marx's history of class struggle outlines 6 stages of history, each one creating the foundation for the next. They are: primitive communism, slave society, feudalism, capitalism, socialism, and communism.So how does all this tie into Bitcoin?I think there is an interesting parallel between how Marx describes the transition from capitalism to socialism and what we are seeing today with the adoption of Bitcoin. As I said before, Marx believed that capitalism was a fantastic tool for increasing production and development. You can attack his beliefs as much as you want (and there is plenty to criticize in his writing) but there is no denying that Marx was brilliant when it came to forecasting the consequences of trade. From The Communist Manifesto:Modern industry has established the world market, for which the discovery of America paved the way. This market has given an immense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication by land...as industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed, (and) increased its capital.Keep in mind that this man is writing in 1848, a time when the “world market” barely existed. Marx carries the consequences of the global spread of capitalism to what he believed to be their logical conclusion:In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. And as in material, so also in intellectual production. The intellectual creations of individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature.Marx never explicitly outlines how capitalism becomes socialism. Nor does he give a timeline for when it will happen (though he hoped it would happen during his lifetime). All that he leaves readers with is his certainty that this revolution will happen and that it will occur at a time when capitalism has spread across the entire globe threatening the clarity of national boundaries and ownership of intellectual creations.A time much like today.Viewed through this Marxist lense Bitcoin becomes a product of its time in world history. This helps to answer what I believe to be the most fascinating question surrounding the phenomenon: why is Bitcoin working at all?While there are obvious real world uses for Bitcoin, only the most ardent supporters of the protocol will claim that the technology in its current state is the best option for conducting everyday transactions. Buying products with BTC can be clumsy and time consuming. Prices change by the minute. Conversion to fiat (which is needed to pay taxes or buy goods and services not offered in BTC) can be burdensome. Secure storage is a vexing process for those who are not computer savvy. Convenient storage is risky.So why has there been a steadily increasing rate of adoption?My hypothesis is that people around the world are excited about Bitcoin because of the promise that it holds as an alternative to the existing economic and political structure. To many users, Bitcoin isn't just an alternative currency or money transferring system. It is a representation of their distaste with the world economy we are living in.Recently there have been arguments that the Bitcoin community is a “rich, white, male disaster”. While there is truth to this statement, it is also an editorialized simplification. A more measured analysis of the data reveals a different conclusion. From the blog Simulacrum (which the HuffPo article used as the source for its data):The results so far from the 2014 community survey suggest the community is now only about one quarter libertarian, matched by a quarter liberal, and a quarter more left-wing, with a few smaller groups of other political identities. When asked to choose a political label, we get responses from all four quadrants of the political compass.And when discussing the idea that Bitcoiners are wealthy:On the contrary, during my ethnographic research a far more common background story is one of precarious living arrangements, economic uncertainty, and limited opportunities. Bitcoiners rarely talk about how many bitcoins they have, instead focusing on when they first heard about it, when they first got involved, and how they feel about the project. They do not talk about their stash as an asset, but rather as a shared interest. When the cruder financial implications are discussed, they are usually framed in terms of empowerment and escape, the plans for buying a house, raising a family, or gaining the economic freedom to focus on some other project.Far from the elites suggested in the Huffington Post article, Simulacrum paints a picture of the average Bitcoin user as an everyman frustrated by what Marx would describe as the (again from the Manifesto) “uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation” that distinguishes our modern “bourgeois epoch”. These people are not attracted to Bitcoin because they want to buy drugs or get rich quick. They are human beings frustrated with the instability of our modern society captivated by a system that just might offer hope for a better way.This mentality can be traced back to the very inception of Bitcoin. While Satoshi never actually outlines his mission for this technology in the White Paper, there are clues to what he wanted to accomplish with his/her/their creation. Consider the note embedded in the Genesis Block:Jan. 3, 2009: The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.The 2008 worldwide collapse was a monumental failure by the financial sector and the governments that oversee them that ended up having global consequences, consequences that hurt the financially vulnerable people of the world more than anyone else. Economists decided the best course of action to fix this situation was a bailout for banks, the same institutions that helped cause the crisis. Judging by the Genesis Block note, Satoshi took issue with this solution and he viewed the cryptographic reliability of Bitcoin as a tool to stop this reliance on flawed human agency.Satoshi had political motives as well. While he did not see Bitcoin as a necessary and sufficient tool for creating a better world, he believed it was a start. From the Cryptography Mailing List:Yes, (we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography), but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.And here, again, we come back to Marx. If Bitcoin does end up becoming part of a larger global revolution, its decentralized nature is exactly what Marx predicted. He did not believe in the proletariat’s ability to organize themselves effectively. From Phillip Gasper’s The Communist Manifesto: A Road Map To History’s Most Important Political Document:Marx and Engels (his co-writer) never speculated on the detailed organization of a future socialist or communist society. The key task for them was building a movement to overthrow capitalism. If and when that movement was successful, it would be up to the members of the new society to decide democratically how it was to be organized, in the concrete historical circumstances in which they found themselves.And so the Bitcoin economy finds itself five years into this social experiment, with no central authority or backing, but nonetheless a growing global community guided by nothing but the collective belief that there is a better way for the world to go about the ordinary business of life. Should it succeed in changing the way we all interact, historians and economists could be forced to reevaluate their criticisms of a man that long ago predicted the evolution of human trade.",

    "text": "Jamie Dimon opened his mouth in Davos about bitcoin and nonsense came out. “It’s a terrible store of value,” Dimon told CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. “It could be replicated over and over.”“It doesn’t have the standing of a government,” added Dimon. “And honestly, a lot of it — what I’ve read from you guys — a lot of it is being used for illicit purposes.”Evidently Dimon hasn’t heard only 21 million bitcoin can be produced and it gets harder and harder to create new bitcoin, with only a few produced each hour. We can’t say the same for the Federal Reserve and its partners in money creation, the commercial banks.The lack of government standing means there would be no bitcoin bailout for JP Morgan should the need arise. No wonder Dimon hates it. As far as being used for illicit purposes, that’s rich coming from a guy whose bank was just fined two billion dollars for not alerting the authorities to the activities of one of their customers, Bernie Madoff.These days, Dimon is viewed as the smartest banker in any room he enters. In 1716 France John Law was that guy. Way more interesting than Dimon, Law was James Bond-like — a suave, debonair, womanizing gambler who (like Dimon) always seemed to come out on top. Law had plenty of friends in high places and worked the party circuit throughout Europe, as Dimon works Davos today.However, Law had a skeleton in his closet in the form of Edward Wilson, whom he killed in a duel for which details remain sketchy. (Did the two men duel over Elizabeth Villiers, “the king’s boss-eyed, unattractive mistress,” or a certain Mrs. Lawrence, or money Wilson had received from a homosexual lover?) Dimon’s skeletons are all in the open as JPMorgan pays various fines for the bank’s running afoul of the regulators.This collision of Dimon, Law, and bitcoin was created by Joel Dietz with his piece in the November Bitcoin magazine entitled, “Why John Law Gambles with Bitcoins.” Dietz, 300 years after the fact, presents a thought experiment with the question, “What would [Law] say about Bitcoin and other digital currencies.”While Dietz gets many of the juicy anecdotes about the Scotsman correct, he starts spinning the Law legacy from his opening sentence, “Today, John Law is often hailed as one of the greatest financial innovators of all time.”I’m not sure who Dietz thinks has been hailing Law for greatness. Charles Rist, in his book History of Money and Credit: From John Law to the Present Day, wrote of Law’s theories,Law’s writings . . . already contain all the ideas which constitute the equipment of currency cranks—fluctuations in the value of the precious metals as an obstacle to their use as a standard . . . the ease with which they can be replaced by paper money, money defined simply as an instrument of circulation (its function of serving as a store of value being ignored), and the conclusion drawn from this definition that any object can be used for such an instrument, the hoarding of money as an offence on the part of the citizens, the right of the government to take legal action against such an offence, and to take charge of the money reserves of individuals as they do of the main roads, the costliness of the precious metals compared with the cheapness of paper money.Only Keynesians have a soft spot in their hearts for Law. Law biographer and Mississippi Bubble expert Antoin Murphy said it best. “Keynes can be termed as post-Lawian!”Followers of the Fed and Keynesian policies will find this John Law quote familiar.An abundance of money which would lower the interest rate to 2% would, in reducing the financing costs of the debts and public offices etc. relieve the King. It would lighten the burden of the indebted noble landowners. This latter group would be enriched because agricultural goods would be sold at higher prices. It would enrich traders who would then be able to borrow at a lower interest rate and give employment to the people.In Choice in Currency F.A. Hayek linked Law and Keynes.LORD KEYNES has always appeared to me as a new John Law. Like Law, Keynes was a financial genius who made some real contributions to the theory of money…But Keynes could never free himself from the popular false belief that, as Law expressed it, “as the additional money will give work to the people who were idled and enabled those already working to earn more, the output will increase and industry will proper.”Joe Salerno weighs in on Law’s legacy in his book Money: Sound and Unsound.as the founder and head of what, in effect, was one of the first national central banks in history, the Banque Generale (later, the Banque Royale) of France, Law almost singlehandedly destroyed the French monetary system in the course of four short years (1716-1720). As a monetary theorist, Law has been called the “ancestor of the idea of a managed currency” by no less an authority on economic doctrine than Joseph Schumpeter.Diest gives the impression that Law started what would become the Mississippi Company to raise money to settle the Louisiana Purchase and bring “back the great riches of the new world.While the company’s sole asset was government-granted trading rights with this new territory, the use of funds raised through stock sales was to refinance France’s burdensome debt.While Law’s system relieved the government’s debt service, the resulting inflation, in the words of economic historian Earl Hamilton, “was a catastrophe to the labouring class.” Overall, prices more than doubled for the working class and the prices of some food items (like bread) soared 300 to 400 percent.These facts fly in the face of Dietz’s comment, “Law’s primary flaw was that he was too successful.”Dietz takes a big leap when he writes, “It should be clear that Law would see digital money as the future.” The value of bitcoin and successful cryptocurrencies is in their limited number. Dimon may think bitcoin can be reproduced ad infinitum but Satoshi put a lid on bitcoin issuance for a reason. His creation of the best known cybercurrency was a direct response to the mismanagement of money by central banks that endlessly create money. The result being distractive booms, busts and inflation.Law was the sole person who decided how much money Banque Generale would create. He did not want to be hemmed in by limits to his money issuance. He believed his system was saving France, its government, and creating prosperity. While its possible Law learned something from the debacle he created, assuming he’d embrace the strictures of Satoshi's structure is far-fetched.Dietz is more likely to be right that Law “would almost certainly be running the circuit talking to central bankers.” Law believed as central bankers believe today, that economies can be managed if the right smart people are in charge, what Jim Grant calls the PHD standard. But competing crypto-currencies are the antithesis of central planning in money.“Cryptocurrency is the future,” Dietz concludes. “It just calls for a bit of vision and boldness to pull it off on the scale needed. It needs another John Law.” What Dietz dreams of is Law sliding into the shoes of Janet Yellen or Mario Draghi and turning all government paper and coin into government digits.However, cryptocurrency is the future for the exact opposite reason. The vision needed is not Law’s but Hayek’s, who wrote, “It seems to me that if we could prevent governments from meddling with money, we would do more good than any government has done in this regard. And private enterprise would probably have done better than the best they have ever done.”Technology and private enterprise have arrived just in time to compete with government in the monetary arena. The last thing needed is a currency crank with friends in government to derail the prosperity private money can bring.",

    "title": "So far in 2014, the biggest news in popular economics has been Thomas Piketty and his book Capital in the",
    "text": "So far in 2014, the biggest news in popular economics has been Thomas Piketty and his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century. It has struck a nerve with a worldwide populous that is still reeling in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, with some estimates putting sales of the book at over 200,000 in just a few months.This is remarkable for a 600+ page tome on economics, a subject which the general public usually regards with disdain. Harvard University Press, Capital’s publisher and a company that considers a book with 60,000 sales in a year a blockbuster, has been flooded with orders. In a world searching for answers to economic turmoil, Piketty’s insightful publication has been welcomed with open arms.For those who have not read the book (disclaimer: I have not, besides a quick overview for the purpose of the article) or one of the web’s many summaries, here’s the quick run down of Piketty’s research and the conclusions he comes to:Using comprehensive financial data from Europe and the United States dating back to the 18th century, Capitalpresents evidence for a central thesis that, in a capitalist economic system, the rate of return on capital is usually greater than the rate of economic growth. What this means is that, over the long-run, we can expect inequality to rise as the rich (who make their money largely off capital – defined as real assets such as land, natural resources, houses, office buildings, factories, machines, software, patents, and stocks and bonds that represent a financial interest in those assets) get richer, while the poor and middle class (who make their money working in the larger economy) fall behind. Piketty argues that this should be avoided because he believes that such a concentration of wealth will lead to economic instability. In conclusion, he proposes a global progressive tax system to curb these negative externalities produced by the nature of capitalism.It is with this conclusion that Piketty runs into problems. He himself admits that the proposal is “utopian” and that, at best, reformists can hope for regional wealth taxes in areas the size of Europe or the United States, no larger. And this is dependent on the actions of politicians, many of whom win or lose elections based on the backing of wealthy donors. In an email exchange with Bloomberg Businessweek, Piketty said “this is political, not technical”. Following this, the prescription recommended by Capitalseems doomed to fail.The Inefficiencies of FinanceAs I have covered before, economists don’t think very highly of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Although they are coming around to the idea, the discipline as a whole still views the nascent technology as not much more than an interesting experiment. So it should be no surprise that Piketty doesn’t consider what it could do to help solve his crisis of inequality. However, when looking at his research, there are interesting connections between what he views as a leading cause of inequality in the past 30 years and the inefficiencies that cryptocurrencies were invented to solve.In his book, Piketty identifies the source for rising inequality in the U.S. and other English speaking countries as the advent of “supermanagers”, by which he means top executives of large corporations with very rich compensation packages. In his review of the book, Nobel winning economist Robert Solow says this is an issue because “With or without stock options, these large pay packages get converted to wealth and future income from wealth.” This, in turn, continues the trend of inequality. From Capital:“(T)he explosion of top incomes explains most (generally at least two-thirds) of the increase in the top centile’s share of national income; the rest is explained by robust income from capital. In all the English-speaking countries, the primary reason for increased income inequality in recent decades is the rise of the supermanager in both the financial and nonfinancial sectors.”The reason Piketty identifies a distinction between financial and non-financial sectors is thus:“It is also interesting to note that the financial professions (including both managers of banks and other financial institutions and traders operating on the financial markets) are about twice as common in the very high income groups as in the economy overall (roughly 20 percent of the top .1 percent whereas finance accounts for less than 10 percent of GDP).”Now, it is important to address two things. First, Piketty does not point to the finance industry as the sole driver behind rising inequality. He is careful to say that “80 percent of the top income groups are not in finance, and the increase in the proportion of high-earning Americans is explained primarily by the skyrocketing pay packages of top managers of large firms in the non-financial as well as financial sectors.” Second, while Capital is a book intended to have worldwide scope, this phenomenon of supermanagers is labeled as a mainly American phenomenon.Nonetheless, these findings strongly support the idea that the financial industry has become bloated, furthering inequality and, in the words of billionaire investor George Soros, “acting as a parasite on the real economy.” Even if, as Piketty argues, the phenomenon of supermanagers is a largely American issue, it still has effects on the rest of the world. Globalization has made markets so interconnected that financial crises are no longer isolated to single countries. That is why the 2008 disaster, largely an American production, has created lasting worldwide issues.Furthermore, while “80 percent of the top income groups are not in finance”, the rise of supermanagers in the United States has coincided withthe trend of executives receiving most of their compensation in stock options instead of cash. This directly ties their income to Wall Street, and the financial industry that rules it, even for executives of businesses that normally would have nothing to do with the stock market. Together with Piketty’s data, all of this creates a picture of a world where the main driver of inequality, and all the ills it brings, is greed by those who control the commanding heights of the economy.What Satoshi SaidThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto did not say much about what Bitcoin was meant to accomplish. As Alec Liu of Vice put it, he seemed to have an “inherent awareness of PR game theory”. This was probably wise. Digital money is a controversial enough subject without any inflammatory comments from the “CEO of Bitcoin” for the mainstream news to attack. But, as the above genesis block note implies, he probably had issues with the way the 2008 financial crisis was handled. One can only assume this is what he meant by inaugurating the blockchain with such a bold statement.It is not far-fetched to extend Satoshi’s distaste with the 2008 crisis to a belief that he saw Bitcoin as an improvement over the financial system that spawned it, an argument supported by his statement that “the utility of the exchanges made possible by Bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used. Therefore, not having Bitcoin would be the net waste”. As Andreas Antonopoulos says: “Bitcoin allows anyone to participate in financial and banking innovation and to build new financial applications, financial instruments and transaction types. From global lotteries, to escrow systems, international payments, investments or simple retail transactions, the possibilities for incredibly novel uses are really almost endless”.And here we come back to Piketty’s problem of treating inequality. In terms of stopping one of the main causes of rising imbalance (the continued dominance of supermanagers that are closely tied to the world of finance), the intelligent utilization of the technology behind cryptocurrencies is a far more feasible treatment than his “utopian” idea of implementing a worldwide tax on capital.To be clear, I am not saying that if the entire world switched to using Bitcoin for every transaction it would solve issues of inequality. As others have pointed out, the Bitcoin economy is extremely unequal, with a few wallets controlling massive amounts of coins.Instead, what Bitcoin and the open source blockchain technology can do is provide a foundation on which humanity can build a more efficient system for facilitating global finance, one which is based off of mathematics instead of the choices of a privileged few. Will it reverse all of our current inequality? No. Much of the capital that Piketty addresses in his book is entrenched physical wealth held securely by the super rich. It will take a long time to reverse this imbalance. But the intelligent utilization of Bitcoin’s technology can at least begin the process of slowing the growth.Familiar SentimentsPiketty’s book is a triumph of economic research and a fantastic educational tool on one of the most important social and political issues of our times. His contributions should be celebrated. However, he falls short in finding a solution to the problems revealed by his data.Of course, this is nothing new to economics. In the late 18th century the discipline was nicknamed “the dismal science” by Victorian historian Thomas Carlyle. He was inspired to bestow the moniker in response to economist Thomas Robert Malthus’ prediction of impending mass starvation based on the mathematical principle that, while population grows exponentially, food production grows linearly. Malthus said “The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man.”Today it is easy to see where Malthus went wrong: he underestimated the power of human ingenuity. While the global population has indeed grown exponentially, our ability to grow food has evolved as well. Enough food is grown today to provide more than enough caloric intake for every person on the planet. The problem is, most people don’t have enough money to buy it, so almost half is thrown away. Many factors contribute to this problem including lack of education, poor infrastructure and, of course, global inequality.It is easy to come to the same conclusion as Malthus: these problems are too big to solve. That is what I think happened to Piketty. He tried to solve inequality with existing tools (global taxes) instead of letting his imagination entertain the possibility of what new innovations (Bitcoin and the blockchain) could do to replace today’s inefficiencies (a bloated financial sector).I find it hard to blame him though. If I was writing a 600-page book it would be easy to miss the news about an upstart digital currency and the revolutionary technology behind it.Now that he’s done, maybe he’ll have time to catch up on the times.Featured image uses charts from Thomas’ paper on income inequality.",

    "text": "*This article originally appeared at Bitcoin Not Bombs.With the media frenzy in full tilt after the closing of MtGox, there have been quite a few articles coming out declaring the death of bitcoin and an equal number reassuring us that it will be just fine. I won’t link to the former ones because they’re so painfully uninformed and rely on tired scare tactics. I have come across one article of a different vein, though, and it seeks to bring in the toxic philosophy of privilege checking as a critique against the Bitcoin community. I could wax philosophic about the specific problems with the academia class developing a divisive practice based on classist, racist, and sexist premises, but I specifically want to address the claims of the author of this piece.There’s no shortage of commenters decrying the inequality of the Bitcoin community from their ivory towers, but to say Bitcoin is “by the privileged, for the privileged” is a new low. The author, Annie Rose-Strasser, claims that Bitcoin is a boy’s club and cites statistics that show men dominate the sphere, but this is neither new nor compelling news. The tech field is dominated by men because more men prefer tech work than women for several reasons, similar to how more women dominate other fields such as nursing and teaching. I’ve argued before that these preferences are not a bad thing and believe they represent a natural division of labor that arises when you have a relatively free economy in which people are not forced into specific fields of work.Even though men make up the majority of Bitcoiners they do not work to exclude women, people of color, or those in poverty; in fact, the fastest growing sector of the Bitcoin economy is charities—each of which equally feature women in prominent roles and some of which feature no men on their teams. I am in the unique position of being in one of these myself (Bitcoin Not Bombs) and working closely with the other ones—mainlySean’s Outpost Homeless Outreach, Fr33 Aid, andAntiwar.com. BitGive, Shire Sharing, Bitcoin100, and Good-Bits are other charities/nonprofits that also use bitcoin to help others. Bitcoin100 actually lists dozens more charities that accept bitcoin on their site, and to date the charities I have mentioned have helped thousands of people locally and globally suffering from poverty whether due to homelessness or natural disasters like the typhoon in the Philippines.It is no longer a hypothetical theory that bitcoin can be used to help the downtrodden; it is a reality that takes place every day. Sean’s Outpost Homeless Outreach has served over 50,000 meals to homeless residents in Pensacola alone and has bought a nine acre property that will be used as a safe camping space for the homeless, Bitcoin Not Bombs clothed and fed hundreds in their Hoodie the Homeless project, Fr33 Aid sent medical supplies and aid to hundreds afflicted by the typhoon in the Philippines, and Shire Sharing fed over 1,000 people Thanksgiving dinner in New Hampshire. The ability of bitcoin to be sent internationally in a matter of seconds directly to individuals in need for nearly free is ushering a new era of mutual aid and global cooperation. Strasser supplied zero evidence that bitcoin harms the poor, and it is abundantly clear that bitcoin is being used for the very things she claims it isn’t used for.Strasser makes the extremely ignorant assumption that due to this male dominance, Bitcoin users are hostile to the unbanked and other oppressed groups. You would have to be living under a rock feasting solely on anti-Bitcoin propaganda to think that Bitcoin is only about making money and oppressing the lesser privileged. In fact, Bitcoin can help the unbanked more than government agencies. You do not need a driver’s license, bank, or even a place of residence to start using bitcoin. There are homeless people in Pensacola, FL who have literally used bitcoin to pull themselves out of poverty—good thing they have their home now so they can check their privilege.After speaking with Jesse, one of the men featured in the Wired story, their biggest hurdle to getting into a home was going through the costly regulations imposed by the state. When you speak with other homeless people in Pensacola, you learn that coding regulations prevent them from living in abandoned buildings and anti-homeless camping bans prevent them from camping on secluded public property.The state is standing in the way of one of the largest unbanked groups gaining financial and physical independence. The anti-homeless camping bans are not unique to Pensacola, and there’s even an actual state representative that physically destroys the property of homeless people in Hawaii. The homeless population is being physically oppressed by the very state Strasser argues is necessary for women of color to rise out of their situations.Now to possibly the most offensive part of the article, Strasser actually argues that women of color in particular are dependent on the current welfare state and desperately need government programs to help them. If that isn’t laying the paternalism on pretty thickly, I don’t know what is. I mean, really, does the author expect women to buy this garbage? “I’m so sorry the institutional racism perpetuated by the state is causing you to suffer. Here have some more state because you are woefully unprepared to help yourself.”Strasser claims that women comprise the majority of the unbanked and that unregulated financial institutions oppress them. I’m thinking she forgot about how the government she loves so much forced banks to give loans to low income individuals who could not pay them back before the housing crisis. Or, how those predatory banks that stole the income and homes of those same disadvantaged people were then bailed out by the government. But remember that time HSBC executives got jailed for financing Mexican drug cartels who killed about 19,000 people, many of which were women? Oh wait, no, they totally got away with murder.Government in its current form isn’t so much an arm of justice as it is a way to keep those with wealth in power and immune from the laws everyone else is forced to abide by. None of the regulations on the books or proposed are going to stop powerful banking interests from committing crimes on a massive scale because of the licentious relationship between banks, corporations, and government.And how about that drug war that disproportionately jails black men for having the wrong plant? I can’t imagine why there are so many struggling, single mothers who are forced to get assistance just to survive. Good thing state sponsored thugs are there to jail their partners, brothers, fathers, and children. I fail to see how Bitcoin is more threatening than the ineffective, unjust drug war and also how Strasser fails to mention this as an influencing factor in the poverty among women of color.Strasser asks, “Why isn’t the crypto-currency of the future taking hold among communities other than the elite?” Excellent question–bitcoin is. One of the most oppressed groups in this country are Native Americans. The Ogala Lakota Nation, a sovereign Native American tribe, announced interest in Bitcoin specifically because they think it can lift them out of poverty. It’s not really surprising since the government has historically persecuted the Lakotas and other tribes. The Lakotas launched the BTC Oyate Initiative Project to raise awareness about Bitcoin and even designed their own cryptocurrency called Mazacoin that is now their official currency.If we really want perspective on privilege, the global implications of an easy to use payment system must be taken into account for its efficiency in providing aid directly to people all over the world—especially disadvantaged women, many of which must raise families on low resources while their partner finds work in more economically healthy areas.The ability for affordable and quick remittances is one of the most promising aspects of Bitcoin. There’s no comparison with Bitcoin and Western Union when it comes to being a cheap, effective money transmitting system. You can’t beat 1% or less transaction fees versus the 12% it takes to send money via Western Union to the poorest parts of Africa. Bitcoin Not Bombs is currently printing Bitcoin quick start guides in Spanish so that people here and across the border can use it to send money to their families back home and avoid high fees. These fees eat up a good portion of what they are able to send to their families back home (and depending on the service, the transaction can be denied), and Bitcoin eliminates these problems.In many cases, being unbanked is a choice made by people who have been historically disenfranchised by banks, and I think it is important not to discount the distrust many still correctly have of banking institutions. Let’s not forget the failure of the Freedman’s Savings Bank, which was set up under Abraham Lincoln. After its failure, depositors–the majority of whom were freed slaves– did not get properly compensated for their losses. I would even say it’s arguable whether the FDIC has the funds to replenish bank deposits in the instance of a modern bank run, but if you trust corrupt banks with your money I guess that’s a risk people are willing to take.Bitcoin doesn’t rely on trusting a third party with your money; its structure forces the individual to be their own bank. While some debate whether that is a flaw or feature, for the unbanked already used to controlling their own money independent of banks it is familiar and easy to transition into.Those “privileged” Bitcoiners are enthusiastic about helping the unbanked get set up with Bitcoin and many spend hours assisting those curious about the protocol and currency. Knowing about the drive, mission, and concern of the individuals in the larger community specifically for the unbanked and less privileged is crucial before you can outright dismiss all Bitcoiners as selfish libertarians twirling their Monopoly man mustaches.The fastest way to get someone started with bitcoin is to help them open a wallet and give them a small amount. I have done this and seen it done numerous times; the community literally gives away money to anyone willing to set up a wallet. Indeed it is how many current Bitcoiners got started. And bitcoin is affordable because you don’t have to buy a whole one at a time, you could buy fractions of a bitcoin depending on your budget. For those unbanked who rely on under the table paid work, Bitcoin is a great way to accept a variety of currencies and actively participate in a new economy–one which rewards bitcoin friendly businesses with consistent patronage.Bitcoin as a payment system/network and as a currency (lowercase b) is also not necessarily trying to replace the current flawed system, as Strasser claims: “It wants to replace our current economic system and practices in their entirety — changing the way we buy goods and distribute money.” My sides! So, you mean to tell me exchanging a currency for goods and services just like you can with cash, credit cards, PayPal, wire transfers, and checks is replacing the current economic system entirely? Strasser doesn’t appear to have used bitcoin or she would know that it is a currency that functions just like any other method of payment, and sometimes more smoothly with less of a chance to commit fraud and steal from merchants like you can with credit cards. Right now, the Bitcoin economy functions parallel the mixed economy, but is superior in many ways.It’s unfortunate to see such inaccurate claims about Bitcoin’s ability to rectify societal inequalities because if anything Bitcoin breaks down these barriers erected between individuals by the corrupt banking institutions and government. The entire paradigm of centralized control of finances and aid is shattered when you can send funds directly to someone in need.Millennials are another group that Bitcoin has helped; the fact that these people regardless of race or gender have made some money out of investing early in bitcoin is great news—not something to feel shame over. It’s appalling that Strasser is saying these same people are somehow terrible because they narrowly escaped the financial destitution many in our generation face after going into massive debt for college degrees with little demand in a struggling economy.Bitcoin should be lauded as a success story for the Millennial generation, and while I have not personally made massive gains like some, Bitcoin has helped me secure some financial independence as a female Millennial who was priced out of college and struggled in numerous dead end jobs for years. This is not an uncommon occurrence, my friend Amanda BillyRock talks about how Bitcoin helped her as an unbanked individual in this thought provoking video. Not all Bitcoiners are wealthy venture capitalists; many are graduates or students faced with crippling debt whose incomes are whittled away by government programs designed to siphon money from the poor and middle classes to older generations. The class implications alone are worthy of considering when talking about Bitcoin’s ability to help the disadvantaged.The Bitcoin world is not all rainbows and roses, and yes you do have to be concerned with criminal elements. The criminals active in Bitcoin are dangerous, but concern over the 0.5% of transactions associated with black market activity is laughable compared to the destruction wreaked by even just one facet of the empire—war; the swiftest way to increase poverty worldwide. For countries torn apart by war, Bitcoin is an excellent way for people outside the conflict to give direct aid and remittances for families who aren’t able to return to their countries (or conversely, escape). This function is really what makes Bitcoin disruptive–it threatens the forces that keep people enslaved by warfare.Strasser is correct in thinking Bitcoin is dangerous; it is dangerous to war profiteers, corrupt banking institutions, unethical banking practices, usurious money transmitting services, tyrannical governments, failed foreign aid programs, and systems that keep people in poverty.Strasser is attempting to force Bitcoin into the mold of social engineers that use buzzwords such as privilege to shame people for doing benign activities like having bitcoins. While shame no doubt has its place for dissuading harmful activities, the privilege argument against Bitcoin is incredibly weak. Privilege is simply defined as a special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to a particular person or group of people. Bitcoin cannot possibly be limited to only the privileged as anyone (even people in Kenya) can gain access to it through standard cell phones, a tool which the developing world has increasing access to.I challenge Strasser and others to go beyond the thinking that Bitcoin is bad because white dudes predominantly use it and they are “bad”; it is intellectually lazy and insulting to the thousands of non-white, non-male, non-libertarian human beings that use and benefit from the use of Bitcoin every day.The barriers to entering the Bitcoin economy are lower than getting a bank account or drivers’ license making it an ideal system for the unbanked and impoverished. Social justice advocates would be keen to embrace Bitcoin with open arms as it—in real time not theoretically—is leveling the playing field and providing the most disenfranchised with opportunities previously unavailable.",

    "text": "Bitcoin is commonly regarded as a truly democratic form of money. Interestingly enough, however, there seem to be various explanations supporting this characterization. Furthermore, at least one of these interpretations have caused some to doubt whether Bitcoin does in fact still represent the democratization of money, or whether it has perhaps become susceptible to less democratic forces throughout the years since its inception. In order to understand why this doubt is understandable yet unjust, it is helpful to recognize which two types of democracy, as distinguished by political theorists such as Cambridge professor John Dunn[1], are often attributed to Bitcoin, and why the most important of the two is still very much intact today.The first main form of democracy, as set apart by Dunn, is essentially a form of government. Hence, at its core, this type of democracy is ultimately a technical procedure, rather than a political value. This procedure basically encompasses the formation of government through the ritual of elections.In regard to Bitcoin, this democratic feature is commonly attributed to Satoshi’s proposal for a proof-of-work system, which would function on basis of a “one-CPU-one-vote” mechanism. But as we all know, this democratic feature did not really hold up. Due to the introduction of ASIC-miners and mining-pools, hardly anyone who uses Bitcoin today actually has any vote in this specific procedure at all, while those who do have a major one.But even though this process of specialization has probably weakened the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin-infrastructure to some degree, the “one-CPU-one-vote” mechanism should hardly be regarded as a fundamental ideal bolstering Bitcoin in the first place. Instead, it primarily reflects one specific function within the protocol: the proof-of-work system. And although that specific function is obviously a fundamental technological innovation, as it helpes to solve the problem of double-spending, it seems to have little to do with ideology.Moreover, this characterization of “democracy” as “majority vote” is a quite limited interpretation of democracy in the first place. Rather, the ideology of democracy, as developed throughout centuries of work by political philosophers and culminating in both the American and French revolutions of the eighteenth century, consists of various Enlightenment ideals. And this latter version should probably be regarded as the more important of the two types of democracy as distinguished by political theorists such as Dunn. Fortunately, this value is still very present in Bitcoin today.One of these inherent Enlightenment ideals imbued in both democracy and Bitcoin, is the notion of equality. Fundamentally, this ideal inhabits that all men should enjoy equal rights under the law, and includes issues such as freedom of speech and property rights. This, of course, is very present within the Bitcoin-protocol. As opposed to bank-money, which can be censored at will (as the Wikileaks Banking Blockade has shown the world) it is absolutely not possible to censor payments with Bitcoin, since these payments do not require a middleman, and literally consist of cryptographically protected information – a pure and therefore very equal form of free speech if you will. For similar reasons, arbitrary confiscations of wealth – as seen in Cyprus – are simply out of the question as long as bitcoins are stored securely.Moreover, the organizational structure behind Bitcoin guarantees an incredibly high level of equality in itself. Fundamentally, no one person has more influence over the protocol than anybody else, nor can anyone bend its rules to his or her own advantage. Not even the inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, or huge stakeholders, such as the Winklevoss twins, are able to change the Bitcoin-code without reaching a consensus among users. Hence, in stark contrast to the immense power financial lobby-groups have exercised over the monetary policy of many nations, or the apparent Too Big To Fail status of modern-day superbanks, each and every Bitcoin-user is truly equal to the network.A second inherently important principle underpinning modern Western democracy is the ideal of popular sovereignty. The basic tenet of this principle, which dates back to Thomas Hobbes’ social contract, is the legitimization of the rule of law by the consent of the governed.And regardless of the legitimacy or desirability of this contract regarding present-day nation-states, central banks run their operations with questionable consent at best. Not only are they purposely removed from the democratic political process (in some cases – like the EU – even quite literally), but merely a tiny fraction of the populace understand what these institutions do in the first place.Moreover, it stands beyond the slightest glimmer of a doubt that private banks do not manage the money-supply by our consent, at all. And yes, they do manage a tremendous amount of our money supply – much more than most people realize. As opposed to the popular misconception, banks don’t actually lend out central bank issued money; not even indirectly, as the money multiplier model suggests. Instead, they actually create money as credit themselves.[2] Yet, private banks are not accountable to the public at all, as the absolute lack of prosecuted bankers in the wake of the financial crisis has clearly shown. To put it bluntly: our current monetary system makes an absolute mockery out of popular sovereignty.Bitcoin, on the far opposite side of the spectrum, quite literally exists because of the consent of its users; if they did not consent on the rules of the protocol they would not use it in the first place. And this use, in turn, is what makes this currency itself valuable. After all, Bitcoin would be nothing but source code without its users. Indeed, Bitcoin does not even rule by our consent, it effectively exists by our consent.By extension, unsatisfied Bitcoin-users can simply elect to withdraw their consent, and perhaps bootstrap a new currency. And this has in fact happened a couple of times already, of course. Unsatisfied with Bitcoin’s mining-algorithm, some have left to (at least partially) support Litecoin. Unsatisfied with Bitcoin’s “waste” of energy, some have left to (at least partially) support Peercoin. And unsatisfied with Bitcoin’s community, some have left to (at least partially) support Dogecoin. Many more might withdraw their consent from Bitcoin in the future, only to transfer it to an altcoin they feel does represent them. They can vote with their feet.Lastly, the third and arguably most important political value underpinning modern Western democracy is the principle of self-governance. And it’s not much of a stretch to argue that the organizational structure of open source programming is, by far, the best way for common people to organize themselves ever invented. Not only is anybody free to contribute to the rules – the code – of the system, this power does not even need to be transferred to anyone else in order to make it work. With Bitcoin, we now for the first time don’t need to delegate a small group of people to govern the rest, but we can instead transfer this power to universally verifiable open source code, written by and for the people. This is a truly revolutionary form of self-government.Of course, some of the smartest economists alive today have argued that this is actually not a good thing. According to them, money should not be governed by the people at all. They believe that money should be carefully managed by experts in order stabilize the value, for instance, or to guarantee economic prosperity. According to these economists, if the people are supposed to have any say in this regard, it should be a very indirect influence at most.But guess what. That’s precisely what some of the smartest political thinkers of previous eras – including the likes of Plato, Montesquieu and Hobbes – argued about democracy itself. All of them expected society to end up in a terrible mess if governmental power wasn’t at least partially claimed by some type of autocratic leadership. Indeed, up until the 1800’s, the term “democracy” was actually a fringe word, only perpetuated by the “insouciant and incorrigible dissidents,” as John Dunn put it: “Those who chose to do so placed themselves far beyond the borders of political life, at the outer fringes of the intellectual lives of virtually all of their contemporaries.”Sounds remarkably familiar, doesn’t it?Sources:[1] John Dunn, Setting the People Free: The Story of Democracy (London 2005).

    "title": "If Bitcoin has its enfant terrible, Amir Taaki is it. Living on a shoestring-budget in squats throughout Europe, Taaki is",
    "text": "If Bitcoin has its enfant terrible, Amir Taaki is it. Living on a shoestring-budget in squats throughout Europe, Taaki is leading the anarchist Bitcoin-countermovement known as unSystem, has built the alternative Bitcoin-implementation Libbitcoin, and helped to invent the peer-to-peer marketplace DarkMarket (which is taken over and re-branded as OpenBazaar). He is currently best-known as the front-man of the Dark Wallet, a Bitcoin-wallet designed to obfuscate Bitcoin users' identities.Amir, your main focus within the Bitcoin-sphere is clearly on the anonymous features of Bitcoin, and keeping the internetcurrency that way. Why do you care about this so much?Anonymity is important because the current financial system is rigged against us. Right now the state steals from people through taxes and inflation, which not only contributes massively to state power and war, but it enables them to control who gets to accumulate capital. Anonymity will help us to avoid paying taxes, enable us to launder money, and facilitate us to evade restrictions by the state on how to manage our resources. It will protect the small guy.Isn't income from taxes used by the state to help the small guy as well? Through public services for instance, or subsidies, or welfare...Yeah but these are very small things compared to the restrictions on how we live. Welfare in particular is just the by-product of a broken system. The cost of living in our society is artificially high, so if you can't afford to pay for that your only other option is to go into welfare until you can sort yourself out to be placed on that narrow path that everyone should follow, and become a small part of a large institution or superstructure: work for the man.But collecting welfare is not empowering, paying rent is not empowering, and working for the man is not empowering. What is empowering is for people to be cooperating together, to form their own businesses, to be independent and autonomous.Some people do need help of course, but this should be something we provide together within our communities. I've lived in all sorts of communities where people help each other all of the time.The tools you are developing can also be used by arms dealers or terrorists, while there was even an alleged IS-document floating around the web which mentioned the Dark Wallet. Surely these are not things you support?Look, we can try to always manage our world and strive to purge it of some perceived threat or evil, but I think that in the end that logic is a faulty one. The way to change things is not by trying to create some sort of system with rules and police and courts and judges. If you want to make something that's effective, it needs to be in the people’s own interest to promote that.I believe that everything is so f*d up right now because we have been abstracted from our human values. It's not natural to get up at nine o'clock in the morning only to sit in an office all day being told to fill boxes under strip lighting. When we evolved, we lived in bands of roving people who acted as an economic union. In the wild, the environment was constantly changing, continually facing us with new challenges. We're fundamentally social and creative creatures. It might seem more comforting to manage the risk to certain levels, but it's destroying us as human beings. Part of growing as a person is having these lows, these dangers, these dynamisms.And at the same time, we need to have fun, which is also something we have taken out of our lives. It's all devoid of passion. We're all utilitarian people trying to live in comfort with smiles on our faces, but how many of us are really happy beneath that veneer?Wouldn't it be wiser to not actually promote Dark Wallet as a money laundering tool though?Why?Well, for one, it might get you into trouble with the law. Secondly, most people would probably not consider it the best possible PR either.But I'm not acting through fear! I'm doing things as I think they are right. I would just be dishonest with myself if I try to play with words or cover up my intent. I want people to know what I think, and as many people as possible, because it's not just about the technology we're building. In fact, the technology by itself is worth nothing. What is important is the narrative, or the ideal that is being constructed through that narrative.Bitcoin is a decentralized and uncensored money with privacy features. As such, it has opened up a new front in the ongoing struggle for freedom.Moreover, one of the oldest artefacts in the world is the Code of Hammurabi, a Babylonian document dating back to almost 2000BC which deals with contract law. Contract law is the foundation on which civilizations are built. And it is the basis for how we – no, they – have been able to create corporate society. Through contract law, you get access to a set of legal tools in order to incorporate and scale upwards.With Bitcoin, we now have a new set of tools, that are not based on the law of the state, but based on the laws of mathematics. This enables us to create decentralized law, digital governance, and a wide scope of means for trade and business.Then why is the narrative so important in and of itself?Because the design of Bitcoin is not set in stone. It evolves and morphs through the actions of people. There’s this silly honey badger meme going around, like, “Bitcoin doesn’t give a f*k, Bitcoin is the honey badger of money”, but that’s false. Bitcoin is a consensus-system subject to all the different power groups acting upon it. And Bitcoin certainly can be corrupted. In very big ways.Is Bitcoin being corrupted right now?In some ways, yes. The Bitcoin Foundation is trying to establish itself as a central point of Bitcoin through which it can fund and steer development, while at the same time working together with the state and Wall Street. What's going to happen, is that governments will use the Foundation to pressure Bitcoin development in certain directions. Chief scientist and former lead-developer Gavin Andresen is paid by the Bitcoin Foundation, while his friends are the big Bitcoin-corporations. So, naturally, he's more favourable towards their outlook of Bitcoin. And if you look at his actions and decisions...He talks about Bitcoin as a payments-innovation, he developed the payments protocol, and now he's pushing to increase the block size limit which would raise the maximum number of transactions on the network at the cost of even further centralization of mining. That is in effect in direct opposition to the idea of Bitcoin as a decentralized, private and uncensored system.You don't really see Bitcoin as a payments-innovation, do you?No, it's not very good for that. The Bitcoin-network is currently subsidized through inflation, meaning transactions cost about thirty dollars each. This vision of Bitcoin as a faster, cheaper and better payments-network is simply not tied to any technological grounding of what Bitcoin is really about. If we want to make Bitcoin a competitor to Visa or MasterCard, we would need to increase the blocksize and centralize mining so much that it is basically the same as existing payments networks. And even then, at some point, we'll reach a limit where Bitcoin is just not cost-efficient. We don't need to have all these miners crunching numbers just so people can buy a coffee. That's insane.If we do not increase the blocksize, however, Bitcoin would merely be able to handle seven transactions per second, meaning its scalability is rather limited...Scalability, be very careful with that word. If we increase the blocksize limit, the bloated blockchain would make it harder for people to run full nodes. You'd need bigger hardware to store all of the required data, so in that sense it wouldn't scale nicely at all.But if we keep the blocksize limited people can always use Bitcoin for payments, they'd just have to pay a bigger fee. This doesn't need to be a problem, in particular for the functionality of Bitcoin as an instrument to settle debts. The way banks work today is not that every transaction done between two parties is sent directly from one bank account to the other. Instead, they add up all transactions between the different banks, and settle the debts at the end of the day.In a similar way, Bitcoin could grow to become the backbone of a whole new financial paradigm, as opposed to a payments network that merely papers over the cracks of the existing monetary infrastructure.And yet, the general public will probably not care about any of this all that much. They just want cheap and fast transactions...Well, a lot of people within the Bitcoin-community care about mass adoption way too much. They want to reach it at any and all cost. It doesn't matter to them how much compromise we need to make, because they think Bitcoin will hit some critical point where – BAM – everything is revolutionized. This kind of quick fix mentality is very easy for people to grasp, but is not based around real social change. It's an illusion.It reminds me of the Esperanto movement, which had a split in the community. The Fina Venko aimed to one day reach this pivotal point where suddenly there would be some global revolution of people speaking Esperanto. This idea was later rejected by the Raŭmismos. The Raŭmismos appreciate Esperanto as a cultural movement, as a social movement, and as a language in and of itself.I reject the Fina Venko of Bitcoin. That's not to say some kind of global revolution can't happen, but this focus on it is a diversionary tactic from the real thing that matters. Lots of consumers using bitcoin in their day to day lives doesn't benefit Bitcoin. It might benefit the price, but the two are not the same.So how would you suggest we move forward on a protocol-level?I would actually suggest we step back for a second. Let’s really fix the fundamentals of the software, and make resilient and well written Bitcoin-implementations rather than trying to stuff everything into the protocol. I'm very conservative in that regard, because Bitcoin works as it is now.There are problems, but I think that meddling with it by opening up the protocol is more of a risk than it is a benefit. Especially because a lot of developers don't see the consequences of their actions. They're just looking one step ahead when trying to fix problems, while totally ignoring all of the social implications and how it changes the politics. Bitcoinj- and Lighthouse-developer Mike Hearn, for instance, was just pushing for an extension to the protocol in order to eliminate possible double-spend transactions in point-of-sale situations. He proposed a system in which miners can vote to steal the block reward from other miners if they accept double spends. The problem is that this opens up the possibility for large mining pools to collude against smaller miners, and use this power to blacklist transactions.And this is just one example, there are many more like it. But it really is insane, it's ludicrous. Just to be able to buy coffee with our Bitcoin-creditcards, and make it a little bit more convenient, we want to destroy all of the freedom it provides? Lose out on the opportunity to enable people to economically organize themselves over wide geographical areas, between different communities, and different organizations with different financial instruments, with tools we have never before seen in the history of humanity? Do we really want to give that up for a silly dream of a few corporations that want to sell a product to consumers, to pump the price? Come on... We're really losing a big thing if we sacrifice Bitcoin for that.You're obviously very passionate about these issues, and you don't hold back in voicing your opinions. As a result, you've berated some of the Bitcoin-developers before, and in particular because of their cooperation with regulators. Can you understand why they'd be annoyed with your attitude at all?I'll explain the mindset of these people. Some of them are just dumb-asses who actually believe we need the government to protect us and all that. But most of them really think of themselves as some kind of libertarian ninja going through the shadows to sabotage the system from within. They believe something in private, but act something else in public in order to build support for Bitcoin, not realizing that Bitcoin itself is subject to change.And then people who oppose that façade suddenly become a threat, because it doesn't conform to the front they're putting on. So the libertarian view now all of a sudden becomes something they have to push out and censor, thinking we need to gain support from powerful actors. But this mindset slowly leads to the corrosion of their ethics, because they start to think that it's OK to do one evil for a greater good, and somehow rationalize their own actions through this construct.This is the real path to corruption. It's not these big decisions, but small day-to-day things. If you compromise once, it becomes easier to compromise again. So you keep going and going and going until you end up with govcoin or corpcoin. We need to be guarded against this.",

    "text": "This morning, I awoke to an individual on Twitter letting me know, in no uncertain terms, that bitcoin and social issues were unrelated. Since literally everything is related to everything else in some way, I’ll assume what he meant is that bitcoin and social issues are particularly far apart in terms of overlap. This is of course absurd. While “social issues” is a term that needs to be defined prior to further discussion, the “social issues” that particularly interest me are issues of poverty, class, mobility, equality of opportunity and access to resources.Access to banking and creditCredit is one of humankind’s most important innovations. The introduction and mainstreaming of lending at a profit is directly responsible for untold wealth creation and innovation. However, currently, access to credit is anything but evenly distributed. Bitcoin addresses this inequity in two ways. First, it offers banking to millions who otherwise are not able to access traditional banking services. In America alone, up to a third of the population is unbanked or underbanked. Regulations and risk combine to ensure that offering services to certain segments of the population is unprofitable. Bitcoin vastly decreases the cost and risk of extending those services to people with low-incomes and poor credit scores. Second, the Bitcoin protocol offers the promise of Smart Contracts. By creating and enforcing contracts through the blockchain instead of the state, people who currently don’t have access to credit will be able to enjoy vehicles, places to live, and other necessities, allowing entrance into the middle class.Remittances and fighting oppressive regimesThe ability to transfer money globally is a very powerful tool in the fight against poverty. Currently, the process is extremely slow and expensive. Bitcoin offers instant, nearly-free overseas remittances.In addition, bitcoin offers an escape hatch to people trapped under oppressive regimes. For example, the price of bitcoin spiked when people began moving their money from bank accounts to bitcoin in Cyprus after the government announced plans to seize cash from the country’s bank accounts.CharityThe subreddit /r/Bitcoin makes up the vast majority of funding for Florida’s most effective and innovative homeless shelter, Sean's Outpost, whose operating budget is almost entirely made up of bitcoin donations by reddit users. In addition, the BitGive Foundation exists to harness bitcoin’s tremendous power to innovate the way we tackle charitable giving. Bitcoin is no panacea. A term like social issues is clearly meant to encompass a huge swath of legitimate concerns, some of which are more closely related to bitcoin than others. However, the idea that bitcoin and cryptocurrency is somehow unrelated to the social would have to rest upon the contention that concerns like access to credit, global poverty and oppressive regimes are not social issues. On the contrary, there is nothing more social than a voluntary transaction. And giving more people worldwide access to mutually beneficial exchange is one of the most important social issues a system could take on.",

    "text": "Earlier this week, Simon Fraser University (SFU) in Vancouver announced that it will now be accepting Bitcoin donations to help fund a project that is sending two SFU students to India this fall, a project that will focus on empowering women. The university has become the first postsecondary school to support Bitcoin in Canada, and may even follow suit by accepting the digital currency in the university bookstore and dining services on its campuses in the Vancouver area.The decision was made after the project received a $6,000 donation in Bitcoin. SFU Alumnus Scott Nelson and Simon Fraser Bitcoin Club president Mike Yeung made the donations which seemed to have further sparked the university’s interest in Bitcoin and its wide spectrum of possibilities. “We are embracing Bitcoin because it is innovative, open source, entrepreneurial and fits well with SFU’s mission to engage the world,” Yeung remarked in a recent release.Simon Fraser University is well-known throughout Canada as a place focused on merging innovative education, research and community outreach. Founded in 1965, the university has grown to three campuses throughout British Columbia, with locations in Vancouver, Burnaby and Surrey. SFU offers both Undergraduate and Graduate level programs in a wide range of programs, and who knows, this university may also be the first to allow students to pay tuition via Bitcoin. This may just be a pipe dream, but this type of support may not be too far off.Bitcoin at the UniversityBitcoin appears to have staunch supporters at SFU, which includes a university Bitcoin Club run by Yeung and other students. The club is focused on increasing adoption of the technology, both as a method of payment and its many other possibilities that cryptocurrencies create.Yeung believes that Bitcoin especially can be molded in ways that benefit individuals and businesses in a variety of aspects – in every part of the globe and every segment of society. The club’s members hope to make an impact toward the successful funding of the humanitarian co-op project to India, and would also like to see SFU join other universities throughout the globe that already are accepting Bitcoin. Postsecondary schools like University of Cumbria in England’s Lake District, the University of Nicosia in Cyprus and King’s College in New York are among those already accepting the cryptocurrency for tuition. The success of this funding effort will likely play a large part in SFU’s future uses of Bitcoin.Funding the ProjectLaurie Macpherson and Lauren Shandley, both Simon Fraser University students, will use the donation for their humanitarian co-op project in the fall. The pair plan to travel to Kolkata, India, where they will spend the fall term working for Destiny Reflection, a social enterprise that empowers victims of human trafficking. So where does Bitcoin play a role?Not only can students, staff and Bitcoin users donate to the cause, but the two students will also be utilizing the digital currency, seeking out places to spend Bitcoin in India while also using it as a talking point throughout the region. “I want them to go and scour for them and then to document that experience, through blogs, videos and to engage local population on Bitcoin,” Yeung said.Anyone can get involved and support these two women as they work to not only empower women, but also bring digital currency like Bitcoin to another part of the globe . . . one that, like many other countries, has many unbanked and underbanked citizens. This is where Bitcoin can make a difference, and if support of the project continues, making a difference can become possible.To make a contribution please visit http://www.sfu.ca/engage50/ways-to-give.html and click “Donate With Bitcoin.”",

    "title": "The word “crypto” is Greek in origin (from kryptós) and means “hidden” or “secret.” Cryptozoology is the study of hidden",
    "text": "The word “crypto” is Greek in origin (from kryptós) and means “hidden” or “secret.” Cryptozoology is the study of hidden and rare animals, cryptography is the study of hidden or secret writings, etc. In contemporary times, the use of crypto as a prefix usually designates a secret identification. While few today would declare their allegiance to the ideals of fascism, it is not uncommon to hear people referred to as “crypto-”fascists. The addition of crypto as a prefix in this case indicates a belief that someone is 1) secretly a fascist or 2) they act in ways to surreptitiously bring about fascism.The double entrendre of “crypto as a prefix” can help us understand the role of crypto in the broader paradigm of achieving a liberal society. Crypto-Anarchists, I argue, are ideologically committed anarchists who recognize the superior efficacy of utilizing cryptographic means to achieve freedom. The population belonging to this group is, shall we say, narrow. These anarchists are “crypto” in the first sense of the word: they are anarchists who deliberately and intentionally want to recreate society on the basis of decentralized consensus, trustless networks, and strong encryption.Cryptoanarchists, on the other hand, encompass the whole body of people who are using cryptographic tools without the understanding that they lead to anarchy.They embody the second sense of the word “crypto” – that is, that by using cryptographic tools as a function of their own self-interest, they are ignorantly and absentmindedly promoting an anarchist world. They are popularizing and normalizing tools of trade – such as Bitcoin or OpenBazaar – without any reference to society, politics, or economics. They are, usually, blissfully unaware of the goings-on at the Federal Reserve or the latest attempt by the Dept of Justice to regulate “intellectual property.” They care not for discussions of Internet freedom, and aside from the mass revolt against CISPA/SOPA, they generally do not foray into topics pertaining to digital property, privacy, political freedom and independence, and so on. They are mostly Muggles who, through natural processes of diffusion, have learned from others to use Bitcoin, TOR, TextSecure, GNU/Linux, or other various tools in the Crypto-Anarchist toolbox.Both of these groups are absolutely vital to the success of crypto-anarchy as a movement. The field of intelligent specialists in cryptography, systems security, digital cash, and peer-to-peer networking is small. Though this group is few in numbers, they provide the much needed ideological zeal to inspire people to devote their time to create these products, often voluntarily. Computer scientists, IT specialists, and software geeks of all types are, like everyone, influenced by incentives. The work they perform is work like any other, and is usually purchased by various companies. Intelligent programmers are normally scooped up by large, centralized companies to tackle specific problems relating to server maintenance, communications, or other projects. Software giants today have little incentive – or perhaps disincentive – to spur their hired coders to create innovative, decentralized networks. Decentralized networks are anathema to the Microsofts and Apples of the world today. Hence, the majority of “software proficient” people find themselves working on puzzles for corporations – they are not geniuses who strike out and break the paradigm.The ideologically committed Crypto-Anarchists are the ones putting fire in our hearts; they are the ones inspiring and encouraging others to pick up an encrypted weapon and join the fight. They spread anarchy through their natural means: coding. Crypto-Anarchists, like Cypherpunks before them, write code. While writing code, they also write prose that speaks to the souls of fellow programmers and software developers spending 40 hours a week to tweak Skype’s “calling” interface. When approached with dreams of independence and integrity, many devote their volunteer time to building anarchist tools. For all its ideology, Bitcoin is COOL. It is NEAT. It is innovative in ways that surpass economics, computer science, and law. It ushers in a new paradigm of communication and contracts. Bitcoin will do to money what BitTorrent did to information: release it. Money and contracts will no longer be the domain of bankers and lawyers. They are unnecessary, antiquated solutions to collective action problems that existed before decentralized consensus mechanisms were available. In the Bitcoin age, they are dinosaurs, unfit for the new future world. Describing and elaborating on this new world brings excitement. Anything is possible! Programmers now have a small side-interest in working on Bitcoin or Bitcoin-related projects. They saw the computer science implications long before economists saw the economic implications (lawyers have yet to be brought up to speed on the legal implications). The Crypto-Anarchist zealotry is hugely important; it shunts men and women out of their regular daily lives toiling away for centralized institutions and it creates a desire to free the world from software giants and telecom companies.While they are the firebrand minority, most of the work to be done relies on the cryptoanarchists: the mass crowd of consumers who desire cool stuff. Once Bitcoin crosses the innovation chasm, and regular people realize they can use it in place of stuffy government money, they will become adherents and will support it simply for the amazing things it does: own and control money without tying it to a legal identity, send it to next door or across the world for five cents, and have perpetual access to your account. Of course, if they realize that it destabilizes fiat currencies and central banks, all the better. But that is the domain of Crypto-Anarchists, not cryptoanarchists. So long as they are using Bitcoin or TOR (to evade internet espionage) or Linux (to evade malware), they are promoting anarchy. The critical tie-in, for Crypto-Anarchists, is to create anarchist tools hidden within amazing consumer goods: Smartphones that are completely open-source, communication tools that are end-to-end encrypted, operating systems that leak no information! This is the key! Package the tools to anarchism nonchalantly in new technologies and watch the world transform.Once consumers start chatting over lines that are end-to-end encrypted by default, dragnet surveillance is over. Once consumers start browsing the Internet through I2P or TOR, Internet espionage is over. Once consumers start using Bitcoin in their purchases, debt payment, remittances, savings, and investment assets, the monetary circus of inflating fiat currencies is over. Without control of money and information, the State itself withers. It cannot tax what it cannot surveil. By popularizing these crypto tools within “normal” consumer electronics, we make anarchy in everyone’s self-interest. No longer need they report their earnings to the IRS because their employer automatically sends a W-2 or a 1099; all earnings and expenditures are on cryptocurrency ledgers.The Blockchain and other innovations will eradicate any ability for the State to prey on its people. Most advocates for liberty have taken the attitude that mass awareness is required, that without educating and informing people that they are slaves under a worldwide criminal apparatus, there will never be freedom – but this is not so! Simply give people the tools to protect themselves, wrap them in shiny user interfaces, and say nothing more. Let the intelligent users discover the lineage of cryptography and digital cash, and let the typical users enjoy their privacy. Nothing more is needed to undermine the State than mass disobedience through cryptography.",

    "text": "In certain corners of the crypto community, ‘Decentralized Autonomous Companies’ (DACs), or ‘Distributed Autonomous Organisations’ (DAOs) are all the rage. In the same way that Bitcoin is decentralizing money, DACs seem to offer the potential to decentralize the entire world of business, commerce, finance, and the economy. They are businesses that can potentially be owned and run by their customers and their ’employees’, with no single owner, and, like Bitcoin, no central authority to act as a board of directors. They are, to some people, a big step on the road to greater freedom and autonomy in our own working lives and an antidote to the corruption and crony capitalism of our current corporate world, and the dehumanising influence that corporate hierarchies can have on regular working people.Ideas like these have created quite a bit of discussion and excitement. Various ‘Bitcoin 2.0′ projects now claim to have developed or to be working on ways for people to create DACs, and the Bitshares project even claims to have started launching them.But what does a DAC actually look like? How do they actually differ materially from traditional companies – and could any business become a DAC? Even amongst enthusiasts, many people still have no clear idea what the answers to these questions are, partly because until we decide exactly how we want to define what a DAC is, there is no exact definition. Exploring exactly what it is that makes a business a DAC is, I think, an interesting exercise which can simultaneously serve as an exploration of the limits of what a company like this is capable of doing. In order to do that, let’s take each word and its definition in turn:Distributed:A regular corporation has its ownership, whether it is private or in the form of shares, registered with a central government authority. It has a head office where a central board of directors gets together in the same physical location to run the company. The organisation of the business is hierarchical, and ultimately there is one individual, the CEO, who has authority over all decision making.It is generally assumed that a DAC, on the other hand, has its ownership verified by a block chain or other P2P public ledger. This block chain is ‘distributed’ just as Bitcoin is, because it is run by a large number of peers, none of which has a privileged position over the others. Beyond this, however, it is also generally assumed that decision making power and even the work done to produce the company’s product or service is also ‘distributed’, meaning that it is spread out across a large number of peers, each of whom has equal authority. If this is the case (it may not necessarily be so) then the fundamental structure of a business like this is egalitarian and co-operative rather than hierarchical – and this probably the biggest difference between a DAC and a regular business.Autonomous:There really is no single vision of what a DAC looks like, and this comes out the most when you consider what is actually ‘autonomous’ about it. Currently there are two main competing visions, represented by the two biggest projects to have set out to create an infrastructure and protocol for the creation of digital autonomous companies or organisations: Ethereum and Bitshares.Ethereum was the project which first introduced me to the concept of DACs and DAOs, and whilst the emphasis of its development team seems to have shifted more towards apps and ‘web 3.0′ technology, these things are still likely to be a big part of what Ethereum’s Turing Complete scripting language will enable. At its heart Ethereum is a ‘smart contract’ system, and any DAO created on this protocol is likely to be composed of an interlocking web of contracts automatically executing to perform specific functions. In this sense an Ethereum DAO would be autonomous in that it could run independently of human intervention. It could trigger payments to pay for its own hosting, run code to provide a service, and perform any other required functions completely on its own. It would not only be completely ‘autonomous,’ but potentially also completely ‘automated.’On the other side of the coin are projects like those created with the Bitshares ‘tool-kit,’ in which a ‘Delegated Proof of Stake’ (DPoS) system is used, which means that coin holders vote for 100 ‘delegates’ who are allowed to earn revenue for running the nodes which maintain the network. The analogy of these people as the ‘board of directors’ of the business is sometimes used, as the ‘shareholders’ who own coins are encouraged to vote for people who work to make the business successful. Through this method the DAC effectively has employees, hired by the crowd.The hiring of human employees blurs the line of what is ‘autonomous’ within such an organisation – the business is no longer a self-contained piece of software, although this may still be the core of the business, but instead pays people and presumably relies on them, at least in part, for its success. Individual ‘delegates,’ however, do remain autonomous. Each person hired by the DAC works independently, and there is no hierarchical structure.The Advantages and Limitations of a Pure DACThe first of the two systems described above, in which an organisation is structured entirely as a software entity independent of any human guidance or control, can perhaps be thought of as the most pure conception of a DAC.There are some obvious advantages to having a company structured like this. It would, of course, be impervious to any kind of human corruption, greed, and frailty. When dealing with a company like this, as an investor, partner, or customer, you would know exactly what you are going to get – you would not need to trust them to behave well and you would not need to worry about human error messing things up. An organisation like this would also be able to operate effectively whilst making little or no profit, because software only needs the cost of its hosting to ‘live off’ and doesn’t get greedy for more.But of course there are some equally obvious disadvantages, as you also consign human flexibility, creativity, understanding and compassion to the dustbin. As things stand there is a very limited number of things that can be accomplished by software working autonomously of human control. As Tom Ding, chief philosopher at Decentralized App crowd-funding specialists Koinify explains in ‘2020: A Call for DApps and DAOs,’ an organisation like this is ideally suited to performing work composed of small, simple and repetitive tasks in which “each task within the network can be easily divided, with the result of work being verifiable either programmatically or through human input; which is very hard to manipulate.”Currently it is very difficult to see how any large or complex organisation could have all of its functions defined precisely and completely enough to be structured like this – and if it did, then having its operations ‘set in stone’ would make it inflexible and unable to adapt to a changing business environment. Over time one could imagine a situation in which an interconnected web of smart contracts develops, in which various ‘organisations’ and ‘companies’ may be built up from the same sea of source contracts and may reach reasonable levels of complexity. One could also imagine an organisation like this using contracts to hire human beings to perform tasks a machine cannot do on their own, but this is so far away from our current position it is difficult to envision with any clarity. If such a thing were to happen it seems to me that it would be something that would build up organically over time, with people focussing on building the contracts rather than the DACs, but with these contracts working together with each other in organisational structures which could only loosely be called a ‘company.’ Various contracts, each with their own set of relatively simple rules, may come together for a while into what may appear to be a ‘business,’ before dissolving their relationships to form new structures with new partners as they adapt to changing times. For the moment, however, there are very few areas of business simple enough to be conducted in this way, and very few ‘smart contracts’ operating out there in the wild.Maximum Fuzziness and the DACification of the CorporationThe second class of DAC described above, in which a group of ’employees’ or ‘directors’ is elected via the block chain, has its own unique advantages and disadvantages.By creating a role for actual human beings you allow human characteristics like creativity and flexibility to play their part in the success of the business. But each human being is still working individually – autonomously – in the way that they see fit. Of course a co-operative approach between ’employees,’ in which each one is free to do as they see fit but they still work together to build the business, is still possible; but it is easy to argue that this co-operative approach will inevitably be less efficient and more fragile than a traditional business, as there will always be times when people are pulling in opposing directions, or where a lack of support across the business would cause a good initiative to fizzle.This kind of organisation seems as if it works best where there is a core product which can be completed even before the launch of the business, but in which the success of the business is dependent on a surrounding ecosystem of services or promotional initiatives. This is what we are seeing so far with Bitshares, in which the core product – each of the DACS that’s been launched so far – is a block chain with a relatively small and well defined set of key innovations funded through a pre-sale of coins or tokens. The Bitshares X banking DAC, for example, introduces assets such as BitUSD pegged to the value of external currencies and assets. Beyond publishing price feeds for these assets, which is a relatively trivial and a purely technical task which will not change over the years, the ‘delegates,’ or employees of this business, are not expected to maintain or develop this core business. Instead they are expected to build services and businesses which accept its digital currencies and assets like BitUSD, to promote its banking features to new users, or to support the current community of users in some way.A DAC built like this is perhaps a little less ‘pure’ than one which doesn’t need human employees, and in return perhaps is a little bit more flexible and capable of a wider range of business activities, but it is still clearly very limited compared to a regular business. One interesting question to ask, however, is how many ‘impurities’ can you introduce before a company ceases to be a DAC?For example, there is no technical reason why a business built with something like the Bitshares tool-kit could not have different classes of delegate: each might have a different probability of finding a block (and hence a different level of earnings). Perhaps these classes could relate to a marketing department, product development department, and so on. If you push this principle even further you could imagine a wide range of different employees being directly elected by shareholders – or you could just as well imagine a human resources department being voted in to hire other employees. Likewise you can imagine the core block chain being pushed into the back-room; imagine a physical shop, for example, with a Point of Sale system which allows the cashier to accept a $10 cash payment and automatically buy $10 of the company’s token on the open market and use it to purchase a product. The block chain now goes from the core service to a piece of back-end accounting software.The specific advantages of doing something like this are entirely dependent on the specifics of the implementation. Whether a business like a big chain store implementing things like this would still qualify as a DAC or not is largely a matter of our own personal choice. But it may be that in the future the seemingly stark line between a DAC and a traditional business is a whole lot fuzzier than what we see at the moment, and that a wide range of businesses may be amenable to some form of ‘DACification.’",

    "text": "We have been brought to a point where it has become necessary to dissolve the bond between currency and institution. We are not required to declare the causes which impel us to push for the separation, but we will oblige.We hold these truths to be self-evident. We have been cyclically betrayed, lied to, stolen from, extorted from, taxed, monopolized, spied on, inspected, assessed, authorized, registered, deceived, and reformed. We have been economically disarmed, disabled, held hostage, impoverished, enervated, exhausted, and enslaved. And then there was bitcoin.But we are in an age of appropriation, and nothing is immune. Today bitcoin is not only volatile in its value, but in its very essence. Bitcoin is in the crucial stages of development. Its code can evolve in several directions. It’s under threat from those who don’t understand it; it’s under threat from those who do understand it, but fear it.The crusade to absorb bitcoin into the seams of the State has begun. There is a conscious effort to co-opt. The goal is to swallow bitcoin, process it, integrate it, devolve it, and keep it stagnant in the gears of a failed operating system. Bitcoin’s potential is being hijacked. They have their own idea of what they want bitcoin to be. They have their own plan for its potential, and they have an investment in that plan. But our consent is withdrawn and the power of our ideas is too strong.Do not underestimate DNA; nothing is born completely neutral. Follow the protocol: it has anarchistic implications. Bitcoin is inherently anti-establishment, anti-system, and anti-state. Bitcoin undermines governments and disrupts institutions because bitcoin is fundamentally humanitarian. There’s an elimination of 3rd party intrusion. It’s purely peer-to-peer. The blockchain is free speech. It’s decentralized, voluntary, and non-aggressive. Bitcoin is not supposed to work within our current mechanisms. Bitcoin needs not entities of authority to acknowledge it, incorporate it, regulate it, and tax it. Bitcoin does not pander to power structures, it undermines them.Bitcoin is an animal of anonymity. Bitcoin basks in shadow. Satoshi’s facelessness is symbolic of this. Privacy is the point. Bitcoin is meant to function outside of regulatory systems. It is not a cog.Bitcoin means to channel economic power directly through the individual. This is reflected by Satoshi’s symbolic birthday, which falls on the same day that Roosevelt signed the 6102 Executive Order, which forbade the hoarding of gold. We repeat. Bitcoin is not intended to be integrated; it’s intended to be a ghost outside the machine.The voices of the people who are working to preserve the purity of bitcoin’s ethos are being drowned out. But actions speak louder than words. Bitcoin is utility. The cypherpunks are building anonymous systems. The crypto-anarchists are making institutions arbitrary. The internet is anarchy. And cryptocurrencies are the printless fingers of the internet.Bitcoin is not just a currency, a commodity, or a convenience. Just like the internet gave information back to the people, Bitcoin will give financial freedom back to the people. But that’s only the first step. There will be a shift in the structure of enterprise, in the way we interact, in the way we voice our opinions, and in the way we fuel our action. Bitcoin will allow us to shape the world without having to ask for permission. We declare bitcoin’s independence. Bitcoin is sovereignty. Bitcoin is renaissance. Bitcoin is ours. Bitcoin is.This post has been translated to Dutch as well.",

    "title": "This article first appeared in Issue 21: Bitcoin & ArtA Book by Irwin SchiffI often cop a lot of flack",
    "text": "This article first appeared in Issue 21: Bitcoin & ArtA Book by Irwin SchiffI often cop a lot of flack for claiming that the fundamental laws of economics, like the laws of physics, are immutable. I stand by this statement because the basic principles of economics are based on scientific logic. The only reason they are so poorly understood is because they are made deliberately confusing by those who benefit from your ignorance.Economics is routinely cloaked in technical jargon and obscure terminology. I am a huge fan of any work that can explain these principles simply and make them accessible. For this reason I maintain that Irwin Schiff’s 'How an Economy Grows and Why it Doesn’t' is the single best book on economics ever written. It was adapted recently by Irwin’s son, Peter Schiff, and re-titled 'How an Economy Grows and Why it Crashes.'I’m a greater fan of the original work by Irwin Schiff, with its emphasis on simplicity. The story is an allegory. It is presented as a children’s picture book. The fundamental role of savings, inflation and capital formation are presented clearly. Economics makes perfect sense after reading this book. There can be no confusion about its fundamental operations and laws.The AllegoryWe start from the earliest possible point with an economy. There are three men stuck on a deserted island: Able, Baker and Charlie. They are living a life of subsistence. They fish. Whatever they catch, they eat. They catch just enough to live, with their bare hands. There is no savings, no capital, no investment and no credit.Able is struck with inspiration one day. He has the idea for a ‘net’. He becomes the first entrepreneur. He sacrifices eating one day (underconsumption). Instead, he spends the day building the net. The risk he takes is rewarded. He is successful and the island now has its first piece of capital. This allows Able time to catch more fish on a given day. He now has spare time to do other things.The net also provides lots of extra fish. The island’s first savings (fish) accumulate. Able has a choice. He can relax for a while, taking a holiday and consume all the extra fish. He can also loan them out, invest them, or any combination of these choices.Able is greedy. That’s okay. Abel is also fearful. There is the chance to have more. However, he could lose everything. The two forces play on his mind.Able can only do so much. The surest way to increase his wealth is to loan his savings to Baker and Charlie. It’s better than going on holiday. He has a chance to benefit even more in the future. Assuming, of course, that Baker and Charlie can make good use of the loans, they will all benefit. That, again, is Able’s risk.Able loans the capital to them, on the condition they spend it on further capital production (net production), not on a holiday (consumption).Baker and Charlie do well, they use the large amount of savings to build an even bigger net. The savings (fish) really start to roll in. This is free market capitalism in all its glory. There is no zero sum game. All three participants benefit.The savings accumulate to the point that they must be stored. A bank is started by Mr. Max Goodbank: ‘Fish Savings and Loan.’ Mr. Goodbank lives up to his name. He only lends to people who have good project ideas to build capital, creating the chance for a better standard of living in the future.The island is really flourishing at this point. It is a fully functioning economy. The island now has savings (underconsumption of fish), credit (through Mr. Max Goodbank) and investments (loaned out fish). The loaned out fish continue to sustain people while they are working on projects that will increase the amount of capital (nets), providing the possibility of greater future consumption and a better future for their children.In a decisive move, the Islanders decide they will form a government. This government will help them grow by doing the simple task of protecting life, liberty and property. That is all. The islanders will feel safer this way. This will help them work.Franklin Dee is eventually elected as a Senator. He makes some decisive moves. As a politician he does not have the correct incentives. Only interested in reelection, he passes a law forcing Mr. Goodbank to extend credit to different groups who can never pay it back. The economy is drained of critical savings.Franklin Dee also creates the Franklin Reserve Note system. These notes are bits of paper that will fund the government’s ambitions beyond the island. Every note is declared redeemable for real fish with Mr. Goodbank. The government goes nuts creating these notes.Mr. Goodbank eventually realises there are too many notes floating around the island. Worse still, his vault has no more fish. The people cannot eat the paper. What savings will they use to feed themselves while they build important capital (nets) for the island?Franklin Dee and his senators have another plan. It’s a fraud. They employ some ‘fish technicians’. They pass a law forcing islanders to deposit any fish skeletons with Mr. Goodbank. The senators plan to engineer fish that look like the originals but are really half the original size. These are deemed Official Fish by the Senators. Only these Official Fish can be used. Mr. Goodbank does not like the fraud. He protests and is removed by the senators.They are able to create so many fake fish with this scheme that prices on the island double, a result of the excess of so-called Official Fish in circulation. The island has inflation for the first time.The senators get even more greedy. These fish skeletons are eventually engineered with only one-third the amount of flesh as the real fish from the ocean. Prices skyrocket.Eventually the islanders notice these fish are not sustaining them, there is not enough flesh on them. They are clearly less valuable than what they catch in the ocean.The islanders start using offshore fish banks. The senators realise there is a threat if no one is using their fake fish and their Franklin Reserve Notes, issued against them. They pass laws to stop islanders from using these fish banks on other islands.The islanders go to the underground economy for real fish. Real fish become so scarce that there is a shortage. No one wants to exchange them for the fraudulent Franklin Reserve Notes. Prices increase rapidly. Inflation gets out of control. Unemployment is a problem for the first time on the island.The senators initiate an unemployment insurance scheme. They print so many notes to cover it that there is a run on the fish bank.The senators at this point are out of ideas. There are no real savings and capital accumulation is stagnant. The senators have come to the limit of their fraud under the Franklin Reserve Note scheme. The fish engineers cannot help.Franklin Dee begs the islanders to start fishing again. However, there are too few people who know how to fish and many more that need fish.The LegacyWhen the fundamental principles and operations of an economy are presented so clearly it is difficult to refute them. This is Irwin’s Schiff’s legacy with this book. The key operations themselves are clear.You first need sacrifice and risk to create capital, which leads to savings. Savings are the physical representation of human sacrifice. They demonstrate a desire to consume more in the future, by consuming less now. They are the manifestation of our will to leave our children a better future. They cannot be printed. YOU CANNOT PRINT HUMAN SACRIFICE. Only savings allow you to invest in further capital production. Anything else is just inflation. This positive feedback loop allows for greater future consumption, provided the savings are invested wisely.Economic actors must be motivated by both fear and greed. Anyone motivated by votes will act irrationally and to the detriment of the economy. Greed is good, so long as it is also balanced by fear. You can not have greed and remove fear. In this situation, again, economic actors will act irrationally and to the detriment of all others.Most importantly, free markets are not zero-sum. That is why they are noble. When they are left to function rationally all benefit from their operations.Ultimately the island must start again, by sacrificing. All individuals must forego present consumption to build real savings and create the economy anew. This means the senators must get out of the way of the process’s good operation.",

Millions of dollars worth of bearer bonds left in the house by its previous owner. Unbeknownst at the outset, the new denizens—a mother (Jodie Foster) and her young daughter—have already moved in. Burnham (Forest Whitaker) grows increasingly reluctant about the entire operation when his criminal cohorts resort to violence. In the end, he narrowly saves the entire family from death.With Bitcoin: The burglary never crosses anyone’s minds. All monetary assets have been transferred into bitcoin, making theft far too difficult—essentially impossible—even for sophisticated crooks. Forest Whitaker asks Jodie Foster out on a date.

    "text": "Fine art meets bitcoin cold storage in Troy Fearow’s “labour of love”, CryptoArt, a project that took the fine art dealer 8 months to construct and launch.Troy searches for and commissions high level artists, starting with Alexander Fedosov of the Ukraine, to produce fine art paper wallets in limited editions. These prints are meant for bitcoiners who wish to store their bitcoin safely and show them off in a beautiful way. And these prints are going fast.Troy refers to these 8.15 x 11 printed art pieces as “Crypto Certificates” and are the size of traditional stock certificates – a beautiful juxtaposition of old meeting new investing. They can be framed and hung on walls, or stood up on tables. Currently, four hypersurreal prints are available, in ‘Patriot’, ‘Soldier’, ‘Bobby’ and ‘Chinese Girl’ style.Every piece of art showcases a public key in a QR code form, which you can send bitcoin to. On the back of every piece of artwork is the private key. Every piece can be loaded with currency, unloaded, collected or traded, or kept for one’s enjoyment.Troy has been a fine art dealer for over 15 years, and has a background in investments. He discovered bitcoin a few years ago through a friend, and has since been encouraging his group of friends and people he meets to look into the technology. He, like many bitcoiners, gives bitcoin away for free just to encourage adoption. I spoke with Troy over Skype to uncover the purpose for this project and learn about his intentions with this business.Victoria: Troy, what is the impetus behind this project?Troy: The idea is to find really talented artists who can comment on the crypto movement and create fine paper wallets. My vision is to create another physical form of bitcoin; with any luck, the wallets themselves will increase in value along with the bitcoin they store. I want people to be able to view their bitcoins, know that they’re safe.Victoria: So it’s a win-win, a double-investment, if you will. Investing in art and in bitcoin at the same time. Tell me, how did you find the first artist you feature, Alexander Fedosov?Troy: I own fine-art.com and have a database of thousands of artists. I actually don’t remember how I found Alexander; I literally searched thousands of websites trying to find the right one. Someone appealing. I wanted the art to be… a little anti-establishment, but not offensive. I am a big fan of hyperrealism. When I see people illustrate something that… looks so real, that speaks as fine art to me. I am very selective of the artists who will contribute to this project, and I prefer realism. This project is really a labour of love for me. I don’t want to churn out art, and I have turned some submissions down, unfortunately. But it’s time to give the bitcoin community some artistic attention.Victoria: Tell me about the process. When I purchase a piece of art from your site, what can I expect?Troy: First of all, currently, I ship everywhere I possibly can. So, after you visit www.cryptoart.com and of course fill in your details and pay (the site now accepts bitcoin), I send it to you. When you receive it, you’ll see on the front of the art piece a QR code. This is simply your public bitcoin address. You can scan this with your phone and even transfer bitcoin from your phone to the piece. At anytime, you can scan your art to find out your current balance using an application like www.bitcoinbalance.com. It takes you to blockchain.info and tells you how many bitcoins are on it. On the back, if you turn it over, you’ll see a security stick that is on some media. The private key is under that.Victoria: Is that safe?Troy: I wanted the art to be trustless. I suggest people remove the security sticker and put another private key on the back; you can do this without damaging the art print. Take the sercurity sticker off, go to bitaddress.org and print off a new private key. I actually went through quite a bit of trial and error with this, going through many publishers, printers, and had a project engineer. There are many things I had to worry about: acidity levels, media types, copper at one point… It was quote a process to get this working perfectly without damaging the art piece! Even the pixels for the public QR code match the print off you get from websites.Victoria: It sounds like you put a lot of thought into making sure this was done properly.Troy: Yes, I want it to be beautiful, but I also wanted to make sure the utility was there. The art piece itself is a standard 8.5 x 11, so you can easily frame it. You could even keep all your different art pieces in a binder and show everyone your bitcoin! I am working on producing larger pieces as well, which will also follow standard sizing.Victoria: These would make for great gifts. I already want to gift some to my cousins to get them into bitcoin. It seems like a way to make bitcoin more accessible, for people to actually touch and feel their holdings.Troy: You can definitely gift them. It’s a beautiful gift idea. You will also notice that each piece has a suggested denomination of bitcoin ranging from 10 millibits for the Patriot [and] up to 1 bitcoin for the Chinese Girl. You could even preload these and gift them. Eventually, I will create larger paper wallets that will say ‘infinity bitcoin’ on them. That’s more of a piece you would frame. And, of course, you can overload any one of these pieces; those denominations are simply suggestions.Victoria: I love the idea of this. The combination of art and bitcoin, of making bitcoin more tangible for people and increasing the adoption of the technology through this medium. What does bitcoin mean to you?Troy: Bitcoin is open for interpretation. As far as my personal opinion, coming from a finance background, I am a huge believer. There’s so much infrastructure [being created], so much professional institutional interest… it’s going to catch up with the early adopters. I’ve been watching it for a while. I saw the first run up to $30, then saw the crash. Then I saw the run up to $260, then saw the crash. Every crash is followed by a lull, and we kind of seem to be in that lull again. At the same time, we have really sophisticated infrastructure being built, and of course you have a lot of the space developing with alt-currencies happening; it’s all very interesting. I personally haven’t seen anything that could replace bitcoin. [But] expect to see alt-currency cryptoart, as well.Troy and Alexander’s beautiful artwork paper wallets have been a hit in person, garnering him attention and lots of positive feedback at meetup groups and fairs. Even without the prints on display, just the idea of bitcoin on artwork struck a chord with the bitcoiners he interacted with. Several people came up with the idea of the huge potential of social tipping: where the public can ‘tip’ micropayments for artwork they enjoy. These ‘tips’ could go to the artist or even to the institution that displays the art.Troy is releasing limited edition runs at 200 prints maximum per design. He plans on taking his time to acquire really great artists, develop a strong following and ensure the “quality is there.” Bitcoin is on speed, but for Troy and his beautiful art, it’s lovely knowing that someone is taking their time and doing it right.For now, Troy is thrilled to have launched his “labour of love” and is encouraged by the positive response cryptoart has received so far. “It’s so wonderful to meet other bitcoiners,” he laughs. “I introduced bitcoin to a lot of my friends and circles. To go to a conference and all of a sudden be in a room with hundreds of bitcoiners… it’s nice to know I’m not crazy.”I now have the Army girl hanging in my office for every visitor to see. The art arrived well packed, in layers of bubble wrap and foam peanuts and was just a thrill to open and admire. Having cryptoart not only allows me to admire my bitcoin, but acts as a point of discussion for anyone who visits. Visit www.cryptoart.com to purchase your own paper wallet.Hint: Stay tuned for more articles on the power of social tipping + art.",

    "text": "This post was released for Issue 19 of Bitcoin Magazine as part of a series of articles about puzzles and games that started with Issue 12.This series of puzzles and games was inspired by a talk given by the founder of the Pirate Party, Rick Falkvinge, at the European Bitcoin Conference in Prague on November 26, 2011 called ‘the fall of the gatekeepers’. A gatekeeper is a person who controls access to something, for example via a city gate. In the late 20th century the term came into metaphorical use, referring to individuals who decide whether a given message will be distributed by a mass medium. In his talk, Falkvinge maps the epic history of the people’s thirst for knowledge and communication versus the ruling classes’ attempts to control them and links this concept to Bitcoin and how it will bring the banking establishment to its knees.THE HOARDER AND THE GATEKEEPERThe Hoarder and the Gatekeeper is a game for 2 players (the Hoarder and the Gatekeeper) that can be played on a hexagonal grid of any size. We’ll use a grid of 4 hexes per side here and we’ll call it ‘Coinland’.*Image Link Broken*Coinland is full of coins, one coin per cell with the exception of the central one. Each cell is connected to its neighbouring cells by an edge. The ‘Hoarder’ will try to collect as many coins as possible by moving from cell to cell, while the Gatekeeper will try to collect coins by ‘taxing’ the Hoarder, placing gates on the edges between cells and charging a fee each time the Hoarder crosses them.Print the board above (or draw one yourself). Then use loose change or draughts pieces or beans or whatever to fill the cells. Keep the centre cell empty.The Hoarder uses a chess pawn (or any other object that fits inside a cell). The Gatekeeper uses a marker of a different colour than the edges of the board (if possible). Place the Hoarder piece in the centre cell.*Image Link Broken*Starting with the Gatekeeper, players alternate turns during the game until all coins have been collected or the Hoarder is not able to move, whatever happens first.On her turn, the Gatekeeper must draw a gate in any edge between 2 cells.*Image Link Broken*And on her turn, the Hoarder must move her piece in a straight line to a non-empty cell (it must contain a coin) in any of the 6 directions. She must pay as many coins to the Gatekeeper as gates she crossed during the move (she cannot move if she doesn’t have coins enough to pay). If there is a coin on the landing cell then the Hoarder collects it.*Image Link Broken*The Hoarder pays 2 coins and collects 1 coin.When the game ends, count the coins that the Hoarder has managed to keep. This is her score. Then reverse roles and play again. Whoever achieved the highest score playing as the Hoarder wins.PUZZLECoinland is full of gates and the gatekeeper is asleep (so only the Hoarder plays this time). Find a sequence of moves that harvest the most coins. Remember that the destination cell for each move must contain a coin, and each time you cross a gate you must pay one coin as a fee!*Image Link Broken*RACE FOR THE COINSIn this game both players are hoarders and gatekeepers at the same time. So both need a pawn of a different colour and a marker of the same colour as their pawn. Setup the board as show in the figure. There will be 3 cells without coins.*Image Link Broken*Decide the starting player by any peaceful means. Players alternate turns during the game until all coins have been collected or both players pass in succession.On your turn you must do one and only one of these actions:Move your Hoarder according to the rules (destination must have a coin). For every gate of the opponent’s colour that is crosses you pay 1 coin to her. It is not allowed to move your Hoarder across the other hoarder.Draw a gate of your colour on an empty edge.Pass if you cannot make a valid move (either moving your Hoarder or drawing a gate).The player with more coins when the game ends wins. Thank you for reading!",

    "text": "The development of cryptocurrencies has been fascinating to watch. In only five years, thousands of currencies emerged from the Internet following the release of the original Bitcoin protocol. Clearly, we are witnessing paradigm shifts in regards to commercial and legal frameworks, economic theory on money, and new avenues for self-expression.One of the more interesting social consequences of cryptocurrency has been the drive to regionalize. Independent ethnicities, kingdoms, and linguistic traditions can develop a sense of identity by using specific currency. Coins like MazaCoin (in this case, used by the Lakota people) allow rallying around tribal or national pride. They can also serve political functions. Scotland, for example, has explicitly laid out a referendum in September 2014 for the people to vote on whether Scotland should become an independent country from Great Britain and thus the UK. The introduction of Scotcoin earlier this year will help form a public consciousness regarding separation; if the Scottish people can adopt Scotland cryptocurrency, this will reinforce the drive to decentralize further.This reminds me of a point Andreas Antonopoulos made when he addressed the LA Bitcoin meetup in April – that money is a tool of expression. The users of Dogecoin demonstrate that they prefer conducting their transactions in Dogecoin instead of Bitcoin, despite remonstrations to the contrary. There is something silly, fantastic, and absurdist about Dogecoin. It is a coin floating on no perceivable “real substance,” and yet it commands market value. This is due to its community and social features: Dogecoin users are renowned to be generous in tipping and welcoming newcomers, they are silly and outrageous, they crowdfund races at Talledega, etc. Dogecoin also rides on its own absurdity – it is the highest form of satire. The users of Dogecoin make no pretensions about it being the best coin due to its inherently valuable technical features, etc. And yet this is precisely its strength. Visiting the Dogecoin and Bitcoin subreddits will grant one very different takes on the users of these coins. Bitcoin users, alas, are not as wild and zany as our Dogecoin counterparts. The act of using Dogecoin is a reflection of identifying with that currency. Because switching costs for cryptocurrencies is very low, merchants will begin accepting multiple cryptocurrencies. When I am faced with the option of purchasing goods by credit card, cash, bank card, or a handful of cryptocurrencies, one of the criterion for making that decision involves examining which community I want to support: international payment processors like Visa and Discover? Central banks and their commercial agents like Citi and Chase? Or do I want to transact in a currency that is widely held by people that share my values? So-called “non-economic” valuations begin to exist in the minds of crypto users that can manifest in using bizarre forms of payment, such as Dogecoin or even less popular coins.This is not to suggest a global cryptocurrency is a phantom. While there will be a plethora of cryptocurrencies to choose from, certain coins will doubtless remained favored by investors and developers. This will be due to either their superior technological capabilities, greater liquidity, or idiosyncratic reasons such as one being the cryptocurrency of a large nation. The strongest of these factors is hands-down the liquidity effect. A more liquid currency implies there are more partners with which one could potentially trade. Money, in the Austrian perspective, is the most salable good in society. It is that good which commands the largest audience of prospective buyers, and therefore, if brought to market, would sell quickest and with the least amount of friction compared to any other good. Payment systems gravitate towards low-friction channels, and, other things equal, users will adopt the payment system that offers the path of least resistance.Currently, this position is dominated by Bitcoin. By an enormous margin, Bitcoin’s market cap is superior to the market caps of other cryptocurrencies. This implies, in the eyes of investors and developers, that future cryptocurrency adoption will likely to continue to be Bitcoin-based. Bitcoin’s first mover advantages are self-reinforcing because it commands the liquidity lead on all other coins. Liquidity is also related to volatility. An illiquid currency experiencing large trading volume will react in a volatile fashion – prices will skyrocket and collapse over and over.Bitcoin’s liquidity also implies a strong network, as large liquidity implies large transaction volumes, which implies a robust mining environment. Thus, the security of the Litecoin network is far lower than the security of the Bitcoin network, and this is due to miners preferring to validate transactions on a blockchain which includes many more hands. Other things equal, a more universal money is preferred to a less universal money. Not until Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency generally, becomes globally saturated will we begin to see the non-liquidity effects start to dominate.Without any knowledge of technological superiority, new entrants into the cryptocurrency field will adopt the most popular and hence most liquid coin. Another, perhaps more common, function of money, beyond expression, is the facilitation of trade. Once cryptocurrencies are recognized by each individual around the globe as email currently is, then there is no additional network for Bitcoin (or any coin) to gain, and their respective liquidities will begin to approach equality. At a certain point, non-liquidity effects such as technological superiority or social factors can dominate, and probably will. The open source nature of Bitcoin makes long-term coin speculating impossible. Bitcoin could fall by the wayside as superior coins and crypto platforms gain prominence; it could also become the economic backbone integrating every transaction on every platform on the planet. Until such a time when the world is awash with cryptocurrencies, however, Bitcoin will continue to be the global leader.How do these forces coexist? If people prefer more liquid monies to less liquid monies, then there is a tendency for a single money to emerge over all the others. Any slight advantage one money holds over another will create marginal adoption – which increases the liquidity of the money, and hence its attractiveness for other people – and thus create a self-reinforcing loop. This tendency operates so long as there is any competition between monies, for while the world is not integrated with a single money, we are still in a state of semi-barter. Only with a completely common unit of account will economic calculation – the process of transferring resources from less value-productive ends to more value-productive ends – be maximized. A world of competing monies is a world without a common unit of account, and hence economic calculation is stunted to the extent one cannot price his opportunity costs in a single unit.What this implies is that while Bitcoin will grow and lead as a global unit of account, individuals may still prefer to exchange with coins that are less liquid. In particular communities, the members may prefer to be paid wages and purchase goods in a regional coin rather than in Bitcoin. This is particularly true given how easy it is to exchange any number of coins into Bitcoin and vice versa. The cost of retaining a less liquid currency shrinks if one can exchange it into Bitcoin at very little discount.Thus, I imagine non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies (altcoins) will act as highly liquid media of exchange for particular regions, companies, Internet groups, religious communities, and other voluntary collectives. This will become more popular as the levels of liquidity between all cryptocurrencies rise, and the cost of holding assets of lesser liquidity becomes very low. If some altcoins become as liquid as Treasury bills, for instance, then some people will prefer to use them as money for then their social signaling function dominates the liquidity function. Altcoins will be liquid enough to permit regional or private trading groups to flourish on them, and people will choose to give up the extra liquidity they could achieve with Bitcoin to embrace the personality of their unique coin. Fundamentally, this implies a harmony of interests between the users of all cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin will likely be the global monetary unit on account of its first-mover advantages and network effects, and altcoins will satisfy crowds looking for illiquid expression. They satisfy two different desires on the part of people who hold money, and there is no need for excluding one or the other.",

    "text": "Hal Finney was declared legally dead on August 28, 2014. It was a sad loss for the bitcoin community and with respectfully bowed heads we mourn his passing. Hal was a futurist and had an uncanny ability to see trends and technology down the road when others couldn’t. He dared to dream impossible dreams that few could see and most would never believe. He saw the future potential in bitcoin long before it went live. The 58 year old computer programmer and expert cryptologist succumbed to ALS, which is commonly called “Lou Gehrig’s Disease”. It appears there weren’t enough “ice bucket challenges”, which is the latest trend currently taking place around the world, put forth in effort to collect donations to end the disease. For Hal, it was already too late to save his devastated body, but his mind never gave up or gave in. He held a few tricks up his sleeve until the very end. A person like Hal Finney does not go gently into that good night. We’ll get to that.Hal was one of the biggest defenders and supporters of bitcoin from the earliest days. He rose to the defense of the still incubating technology against fellow cryptologists who were convinced it would never work. Hal held the distinction of getting the first bitcoins ever transferred to anybody as a test from Satoshi himself. In that moment one might draw comparisons to the first telephone call made by its inventor Alexander Graham Bell, which was made to his assistant as well. His first words were “Watson, Come here I want to speak with you!” (recorded in his journals in 1876).Some had wondered if Hal was Satoshi, though this has been researched and concluded extremely unlikely. In a superb report for Forbes Magazine, Andy Greenberg was dispatched to the trail of the “supposed” Satoshi Nakamoto during Newsweek’s infamous reporting. When Newsweek’s “Crack” team cast their world-wide dragnet and found Dorian Nakamoto, much of the world seemed to break out a bag of popcorn to watch the story unfold. Many in the bitcoin community were shocked and outraged at the injustice; some just didn’t want the good mystery story to end. So this is where many learned about Hal Finney, his life, and the almost impossible odds that one of bitcoin’s real creators had owned a house and lived only a few blocks from the “imposter” version of Satoshi Nakamoto.With the great mystery and mystique of bitcoin’s true creator still seemingly intact, Greenberg followed one of the leads of the story. The Newsweek headline and breaking story had frenzied reporters from around the world camped out at Dorian’s house just a few blocks from the house Hal once called home. Hal was as curious as anybody about the identity of Satoshi and played with the speculation on the bitcoin forums.Prior to bitcoin, he became a founding father in many of the uses of the Internet we enjoy today. As one of the first and leading figures in the creation of PGP encryption, the ripples of his efforts are felt by hundreds of millions every day. He was stubborn. He did not trust that all governments were all beneficial and could be trusted to do what is best. He was a legendary proponent of individual privacy.Hal spent his last months confined to his wheelchair, unable to speak or move. He did have control of his eyes and could communicate by looking up or down to answer yes or no questions. He was being held hostage by the hideously debilitating disease. With his wife Fran taking care of him full time, he was getting by.On March 19, 2013 he issued one of his last posts on the bitcointalk forum titled “Bitcoin and Me”. Hal spoke about his early contributions to the bitcoin project and his current personal struggles with the disease. He mined some of the very first bitcoins with his PC’s CPU when it was still easy enough to do so. He gave up fairly early when it started to make his computer run hot. Looking back - he wished he had left it going a little longer.A great deal can be learned of the attitude, fight, and optimism Hal had on life. Hal believed in the future and was inspiring to those who read of his account. Even in the face of his own limited mortality he was making plans for his heirs and keeping his precious bitcoins safe. However, some of them were used to pay for his wheelchair and medical costs towards the end. But Hal was the kind of guy who wouldn’t go quietly. He had been training to do a full marathon in his 50s just before he was diagnosed. These are not the aspirations of one likely to just give in.One of his last futuristic beliefs was that he might be back to fight another day. With the same optimism he put into the future of bitcoin and the technology of digital cryptographic currencies, he put into the idea of cryopreservation. At the time of his last heartbeat his wish to be preserved came to fruition. Some people speak about the idea of cryopreservation in eerily similar terms that some talk about bitcoin – as if it’s a pipe dream. The futuristic idea would be that his body may one day be “jump started” once there is a cure for ALS. It’s the stuff of science fiction; but then again most of the world would have put bitcoin in that same category five years ago. The exploding price of bitcoin itself may have played a part to make his last adventure possible.The bitcoin community leaders have begun an ALS research fund. The youtube video with Gavin Anderson completing the ice challenge and includes the link to donate bitcoin directly to the fund. Please consider this request in Hal's honor. Without his efforts in cryptography and bitcoin , you might not be reading this today. The address to donate directly can be found here:Hal Finney was an optimist, futurist, idealist, and a fighter. He once spoke of the possibility of bitcoins reaching one million dollars each. Hal seemed stubborn enough that he would insist on one day waking up to see it happen. We in the bitcoin community salute one of our own. Hal Finney, may all of your optimistic dreams come true. ",

    "text": "The premier decentralized digital currency Bitcoin has gained widespread mainstream attention over the last year. While many are embracing this new peer-to-peer payment system, others have voiced strong suspicion and offer stinging criticism. The divergence of opinion surrounding Bitcoin is a predictable pattern that happens with any major innovation.Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur and author Andreas Antonopoulos said, “Bitcoin and crypto-currencies in general don’t fit any of the traditional modes: not currency, stock or commodity, but [are] a new asset class”. He continued, “trying to figure out Bitcoin by fitting it into an existing paradigm misses the point. Cryptocurrencies broke the paradigm. It’s a new world.”The phenomenon of blockchain currencies shakes up our preconceived notions of money, but more significantly, this paradigm shifting technology challenges us to examine our whole taken for granted world. Like in the popular film The Matrix, it engages us with the question; “What is real?” This is a kind of existential crisis. Some respond to it with an open mind, while others struggle and resist the transformative force coming through it. Recently, this tension came to the surface with a new contender within the cadre of Bitcoin critics.Pretend Currency?International bestselling author and expert on money laundering Jeffrey Robinson wrote a new book that stirred a bit of controversy on the Internet. In BitCon: The Naked Truth About Bitcoin,Robinson attempts to, as he puts it, “pull back the curtain” on this crypto-currency.In an ABC interview, he said that the more he got into Bitcoin, the more fascinated he became with the story behind it, which he characterized as “all hype and spin.” He concluded that Bitcoin is a “pretend currency” and that there is nothing happening with it. Although he praises the underlying technology of the blockchain, he completely dismissed the currency element, relegating it to a Ponzi scheme by calling it a “pump and dump”.Within 24 hours of his interview, a chorus of rebuttals struck chords on social media. On Reddit, a thread of more than 100 largely critical and derisive comments quickly grew. A post under the name Paleh0rse questioned Robinson’s contradictory view on the technology, specifically pointing to his suggestion of using the blockchain without the currency as its first application: “The two cannot be separated if the utility of the one (the blockchain) ultimately determines the value of the second (bitcoins), and the second is required to make use of the first.”In the age of the Internet, blatant disinformation doesn’t so easily get by unnoticed and can’t fly for very long. An article entitled Jeffrey Robinson Doesn’t Understand Bitcoin emerged to address his lack of understanding of the technology. In it, Stephan Livera carefully disputes and corrects each misconception. The host of RT’s financial report, Max Keiser, tweeted his assessment of Robinson’s book: “Uninformed, slam piece on Bitcoin written for clueless Daily Express readers is waste of time with zero insights.”A Twitter swarm emerged as Robinson @WritingFactory promoted his contention that this digital currency is nothing but thin air of pretense. In an effort to emphasize his point, Robinson claimed that his book could not be purchased with it. Cyril Houri, CEO of Brawker, took up the challenge and used the company’s platform to successfully buy Robinson’s book with bitcoin. The commentary regarding this futuristic currency spilled into the Amazon review section for the book, where it gathered a wide range of opinions.Let’s look at his book’s essential message. Robinson wants the world to see Bitcoin as a pretend currency. It seems as though this ‘pretend money’ somehow managed to allow an organization like WikiLeaks to survive through a very critical time, when all other financial service avenues were withdrawn from them. This ‘pretend money’ is also somehow enabling Somali migrant workers to transmit money back home without having usurious portions of their hard-earned wages extracted by remittance monopolies like Western Union. People are buying laptops, household goods and plane tickets by using this ‘pretend money’.If this digital currency is not real, as the author of BitCon claims, why does Overstock.com choose to accept bitcoins as a form of payment and iseven giving its employees the option to receive bonuses with it? Have these transactions really happened or are we just collectively having a lucid dream?Robinson argues there aren’t many real bitcoin transactions. He claims that companies like Expedia and Dell that incorporate bitcoin into their payment systems and save the rent-seeking 3 that VISA charges never really accept bitcoin, as they convert it immediately into fiat through exchanges such as Coinbase and BitPay.Whether those companies decide to keep their bitcoin or not is one issue. But isn’t this decision to enable their customers to purchase their products with bitcoin a sign that they see it as a form of currency (a value transfer vehicle)? Would Robinson not see customers who use Visa and Paypal in US dollars as dollar transactions?Most of all, what is it about Bitcoin that makes someone like Robinson dismiss it so forcefully, while others take it seriously and are integrating it into their daily lives? There seems to be something more going on than his apparent profound lack of understanding of this technology.Red Pill and the Rabbit HoleIn the Matrix, Morpheus said to Neo, “there’s something wrong with the world. You don’t know what it is, but it’s there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.” This leads to a famous scene where he offers Neo a choice between the blue pill and the red pill. Morpheus asked Neo if he ever had a dream that he was sure was real and asked if he happened to be unable to wake up from that dream: “How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?”Bitcoin is like the red pill. For those who choose to use it, they get to find out how deep the decentralizing rabbit hole goes. The deeper one moves into the Bitcoin ecosystem, the more the rules of the old world fall away and the hands of regulatory agencies lose their grip. Bitcoin can generally only be confiscated if someone accesses your keys, like a typical outer world robbery.Bitcoin unveils the matrix that we grew up in and the identity that is embedded in the system. For instance, Robinson’s engagement with Bitcoin exposes his deep-seated bias, which was revealed in the way he paints a picture of Bitcoin communities with such a condescending attitude and haughty ridicule.This self-proclaimed Bitcoin expert calls those who advocate this digital currency the “Bitcoin faithful,” characterizing the whole decentralized network as something like a religious cult. One can see his analysis is rather narrow minded, as cryptocurrency enthusiasts come from all different backgrounds and world-views. If Robinson wants readers to take his claims seriously, he would need to become more balanced.His attitude and characterizations may as well be saying that bitcoiners are misinformed gullible disciples of some sort of avatar named Satoshi Nakamoto. If one looks more broadly at this issue from his perspective, it would also be fair to describe those who defend fiat and the system of central banks as fervent believers, blindly worshiping the almighty imaginary god of central banks and the holy ghost of fiat currencies.Robinson’s bias reveals a deep investment in the world of fiat and the Matrix of 1 dominance. He represents a world that was established during the Cold War, where U.S. hegemony morphed into the first truly global corporate empire. This system is now run by transnational oligarchs like Goldman Sachs, and the ones who pressured President Richard Nixon to take the dollar off the gold standard, syndicating an international patronage banking cartel that has recently been orchestrating a massive debt-based Ponzi scheme at a global scale in a spiral of debt and derivatives.Currently, this pretend fiat money created through infinite money printing is treated as real. It achieved massive adoption as the world reserve currency through the creation of the petrodollar, which Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman described as being “backed by men with guns.”Surely, the world created through this pretend fiat is an artificial reality in which those who control its flow are in charge of what happens within the system. They have their own world afloat in a bubble and are insulated from what is really happening. Derivatives along with bond and stock markets are prime examples of this manipulation. We saw in 2008 after huge bank failures from speculation in these deregulated markets that the banks were bailed out by the taxpayers and never had to face the consequences of their actions.Then came Occupy in 2011. People of all walks of life came to Wall Street to confront this rigged monopoly game controlled through private debt-based currency that is created out of thin air. Before the Occupy movement caught fire, scholar-activist David Graeber noted how the 2008 financial crisis and bailouts of Wall Street banks revealed a brazen double standard in the unspoken rule that debts were sacrosanct and no one should be allowed to default, while bankrupt bankers were being bailed out by the taxpayers who were then just loaded with more debt. People began to see money as a mere political arrangement or social promise that bankers and governments make with one another.Robinson seems to be aware of this naked truth behind the existing financial system, yet conveniently pretends not to know. For instance, when he was asked about HSBC’s involvement with drug cartels and massive money laundering, he claimed he didn’t know why no one in the banks went to jail. Here is an expert on money laundering who, when asked about one of the most egregious cases of illegal drug money laundering, seemed to simply not understand why there was no prosecution. It is convenient how people who laud the current system never question the intimate ties between those who regulate the industry and the bankers that they are supposed to regulate.What Is Real?Many who take the red pill of decentralized currency are coming to realize the line between reality and fantasy is just thin air propped up by unexamined faith in a decaying tyrannical state. People around the world are starting to see that the corporate empire has no clothes. We are living in a pretend world, under a pretend democracy, with pretend experts that perform as gatekeepers of power. Under the pretense of national security, state terrorism is made into reality as mass surveillance and wars are justified by manufactured enemies at the expense of our liberty and privacy.Bitcoin unplugs us from the Matrix and opens the door to a new future. As the Internet of money, it creates reality within a new interconnected world. This decentralized potential challenges each to let go of the urge to control, to extract wealth and exercise domination. In Neo’s speech at the end of the Matrix, he described “a world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries.” He also called it “a world without you,” without illegitimate authority. Ultimately this is scary to those who cling to the illusion of control and the power it gives them.Bitcoin is a new paradigm created through each person’s direct participation and peer-to-peer interaction and transaction. This is where everyone who chooses to abide by a protocol of algorithmic consensus is placed on an equal playing field and no one gets to cheat the system. We can then simply be judged by the content of our character and individual merits. Factors such as color of skin, nationality and gender used to advance one’s social position in an old paradigm can no longer so easily be used as a reason to exercise power over others.Can the invention of the blockchain help bring society into a post nation-state world, free from the oligarchic rule of conquest and domination? Is this a living imagination or simply a hallucination? In a sense, this world is no less real than Robinson’s world and Bitcoin’s ‘pretend currency’ is no less real than the fiat money he worships. The emergence of Bitcoin unveils the origin of all money: how it always starts as just an idea, which when it reaches a critical magic point of mass adoption becomes ‘real money’.No matter how this plays out, with the arrival of blockchain based crypto-currencies we now have a chance to take back the power to create our own reality from the elites of unearned authority and free ourselves from the Matrix of this pretend democracy. Now anyone can weigh in on how monetary systems are designed and run and ultimately can claim power from within to answer the question of the new millennium,”What is real?”Currency and sovereignty have for too long been imposed upon the people by unelected corporate kings. We now can create, through the networks of our radical imaginations, currencies of the commons that can carry our shared values and turn collective dreams into reality.Author:Nozomi Hayase, Ph.D., is a writer who has been covering issues of freedom of speech, transparency and decentralized movements.

    "text": "Jerry the Bear is an interactive tool that empowers children with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) to master their medical procedures. The company behind Jerry, Sproutel, is reinventing diabetes education through play. Last year, just two percent of children with the condition played with Jerry, fed him food, checked his blood sugar levels and gave him insulin. Now, the company has sets its sights on a higher goal: getting Jerry in the hands of every child diagnosed with T1D, a vision that, with the help of Bitcoin, can help change the lives of over 12,000 children.This beneficial tool gives children the power to learn everything about their condition in a manner that is completely interactive and challenging. Jerry the Bear delivers a complex curriculum that teaches everything from symptom diagnosis to carb counting. While taking care of Jerry, kids will unlock a series of 21 animated storybooks that tell the tale of Jerry training for the All Star Games. These stories and tasks were developed with the help of doctors, educators and parents. From the help of BitPay, donations can be made via Bitcoin at no cost, so that 100 percent of donations can be used to benefit this life-changing effort.Sproutel’s decision to accept Bitcoin comes from a desire to embrace the new and exciting digital currency, further sparking interest in the campaign and increasing the impact Jerry the Bear can have on every child diagnosed this year. Bitcoin donations can be made to the campaign via the product’s website, coupled with a simple checkout process from BitPay. The campaign is a perfect example of the opportunity and benefits that Bitcoin creates for charitable organizations, allowing charities to receive a full 100 percent of donations with no costly credit/debit card processing fees, while remaining tax deductible.Although the campaign has a wide range of donation options, a $299 donation will provide one Jerry the Bear to a child with Type 1 Diabetes. Thus far, Sproutel has raised over $40,000, which is double their original goal. However, the company has a stretch goal of $179,000 to provide Jerry the Bear to five percent of children in need. If the stretch goal is met, ContextMedia, a campaign partner will also donate 30 bears to hospital waiting rooms so that 20 percent will be able to experience Jerry the Bear. Even more amazingly, there is also a sizeable donation level of nearly $3 Million that will provide the 12,000 kids dealing with Type 1 Diabetes with a Jerry the Bear of their very own.The Jerry the Bear campaign is working hard to make a monumental difference in the lives of others and the future of kids throughout the nation. This matches the vision at Sproutel of creating similar technologies for all children who are diagnosed with chronic illness. By making a Bitcoin contribution, you will be trading digital currency for warm and fuzzies. Sounds like a no brainer.",

    "title": "In this interview, we speak to Christian Moss of indie game developers, Mandel Duck, about their upcoming game SaruTobi. This",
    "text": "In this interview, we speak to Christian Moss of indie game developers, Mandel Duck, about their upcoming game SaruTobi. This is due for release in mid/late November on iOS devices.You are Tobi, a monkey living in a jungle. You must swing from your vine, building up momentum before releasing yourself to fly across the retro 8-bit jungle landscape, collecting power-ups to increase your distance and bitcoin tokens as you careen through the air. The game has three main goals – getting the furthest distance, collecting bitcoin tokens to be spent on items, and collecting the letters SARUTOBI to unlock a big coin boost to spend on in-game items.The gameplay reminds me a lot of the Yeti Sports series of games, and from the videos it looks like a simple, fun game. So I had a chat on Skype with Christian about the game, to find out more about why bitcoin is in the game in the first place, and to see what other plans he has, if any, to utilise bitcoin further in the game.Jamie McCormick (JMC): So first off, can you tell us a little about SaruTobi? Where does the name come from?Christian Moss (CM): I have been making games for iOS for the past few years; however they have always been quite complex, in-depth games. SaruTobi was an attempt to make a very simple/addictive game in SWIFT, which I think is a good combination for the mobile platform.The name SaruTobi is literally Japanese for “Monkey Fly,” and that pretty much sums up the game play; you need to swing a monkey on his vine, build up speed, and see how far he can fly through the air.JMC: What can SaruTobi do with the bitcoin he collects in the game? Buy bananas?CM: At the moment Tobi needs to collect bitcoin to buy extra power ups such as rockets and spring boots which will propel him further, but in the future hopefully we can allow the user to earn actual bitcoin.JMC: How many levels does it have?CM: SaruTobi is an endless game so it only has one level, and the aim of the game is to swing as far as you can, competing with friends to beat each other’s maximum distance.JMC: What else can you collect? And what are the items in the game?CM: The plan for the moment is to get the furthest in the game. There is a second task, which is to collect the letters SARUTOBI; I got the idea from Donkey Kong Country. You can collect them over a few gameplay sessions, as they are spread out sequentially across the map. Getting them all gives you a hefty bonus, which would let you turn off ads, and get enough rockets to last you a while! You can buy bundles of coins via an in-app purchase, though. For future updates, I’d love to try and work bitcoin into the game using donations I receive, but as far as gameplay goes, I now want to get some user feedback and take it from there.The game does feature ads, which you can disable by earning 90 bitcoin. Each token you collect in the game is worth one bitcoin, so depending on how good you are, it won’t take you too long to do this. I want people to enjoy the game and not be stuck with ads forever, so I have made it reasonable to get rid of them in an achievable timeframe.JMC: What’s your own high score? And how did you get it?CM: My current high score is 3,964 meters. As Tobi flies through the air, you can catch rocket power ups mid-flight, which give you a large distance boost. In my case, he swung through the air and I got my angle right, as at the apex he caught a rocket which boosted him for miles. The positions of the rockets change randomly, and you can’t see where they are. I am interested to see how far other players can prove the limit to be, especially if they can do the same with springs or hitting a banana skin on landing.JMC: What was the hardest thing to develop into the game?CM: The most difficult thing to develop was getting the physics right. The physics of swinging on a rope are quite different to what you’d expect, so when you’re swinging as Tobi, getting this feeling right took some time. The first time we modeled a rope properly, but we couldn’t get any momentum up, and if you boosted at the wrong time you’d lose all your momentum. So we had to simplify this to get it right.JMC: Why have you given Tobi the task of collecting bitcoin instead of something else?CM: Why not? I planned to implement an in-game currency when it suddenly dawned on me to use bitcoin.Bitcoin is a stateless currency and therefore is perfect for international use, I guess you could call it the people’s currency – a player in Africa is going to feel just as at home with it as a player in America or the UK. Although bitcoin is becoming more mainstream, the vast majority of people are still very unfamiliar with it. I’m hoping by working bitcoin into popular games, it can help raise public awareness and get people to start looking into the crypto currency.Lastly, using bitcoin in your game can open up a range of features that is currently not possible with conventional payment systems.JMC: Are players able to make purchases in-game with bitcoin, or earn bitcoin from playing it?CM: This is where we would like to go. Currently Apple has been very strict with regards to bitcoin and its usage – specifically, in-app purchases must use Apple’s framework so they can receive 30. However, this does not seem to apply to donations, and hopefully before Christmas we will implement some kind of real bitcoin transacting with the game. This may allow users to donate bitcoin to be held in the game address; the best players may be able to receive bitcoin as a reward for getting a highscore, etc.JMC: Do you have plans to further develop the game?CM: At the moment the game only uses bitcoin in name only, and the coins you collect are completely in-game. However, we have plans to allow the user to collect/earn actual bitcoin, which I believe is made possible with the use of micro transactions, a concept that only bitcoin allows developers to do, i.e., for every coin a user collects he can receive 1 bit to their address.JMC: Do you have any plans to release the game on other platforms?CM: Most definitely. Apple are very strict with bitcoin, and other platforms such as Android are completely open. However, I am a strong believer that we can’t leave iOS users behind. Earlier this year when Apple banned bitcoin wallet apps, our app “Bity” was the only Apple approved app that allowed bitcoin transactions; shortly after its release Apple opened the flood gates, retracting its restriction against such apps. We hope we can do something similar with SaruTobi.We are currently seeking extra funding to recruit an Android and HTML 5 developer so we can bring the game to other platforms, and have the wallet 1DUuk9AvMzBbsdazNTQsyVCy1xX2GdnSK4 set up for this.JMC: Your team is spread across the UK, Australia and Japan; how does that work out?CM: One of the advantages with creating 2D physics games is they don’t require a big team; it’s very easy to [develop] the game with one or two people. Currently I perform the majority of the coding whilst I have a few illustrators in the UK and Japan who I can work with for design.JMC: Do you have a personal interest in bitcoin?CM: I have a miner in the corner of my apartment. I started out of interest because the company I work for made a bitcoin related app. I then bought some bitcoin and used this to purchase a miner from Butterfly Labs. It was a 25ghs miner, which I overclocked up to 30ghs. I ordered in December 2013 from stock. It was profitable for a while, just about made the bitcoin back I put in. I then pre-ordered a Monarch miner and cloud mining service. These never came. Butterfly Labs refunded me based on the dollar price, so I actually got refunded more bitcoin than I originally spent, as the price had changed from $1000 to $400 between the two times.JMC: What led you to combine your interest in games with your interest in bitcoin?CM: Bity is still doing well, and more aimed at people with paper wallets and bitcoin in cold storage. But I can’t compete with big payment players in the field. Games are how I started with iOS development, and Apple released SWIFT in September, which I had to learn for my job. So I made a few games, and I wanted to make a simple addictive game, and was thinking I could put some sort of coin in there. And if I’m going to use any coin, why not use bitcoin.If the app was popular and people were playing it, they could learn about bitcoin as there’s a link to send to the about bitcoin section on bitcoin.com, to help it get into the mainstream. I’m not sure how Apple will take it, but after the game is approved, I’ll see what I can get away with. At the moment in iOS apps, it’s impossible to charge anything less than about a dollar, and Apple takes 30 of this automatically. But I thought that in SaruTobi, once it’s up and running, I can take donations, and then in a later update, redistribute them by giving satoshi to do tasks and collecting coins in-game, and it potentially could open up some new features that the games scene hasn’t seen before. The whole concept of micropayments and the tipping scene is very interesting to me.I found with Bity that I did quite well with optional donations. I was surprised by how many people sent me donations; one person even sent me about $2,000 dollars worth of bitcoin out of the blue!JMC:If someone wanted to put ads for bitcoin products in the game, could they?CM:We use iAds at the moment, but if people wanted to advertise their product in the game, it’s technically possible after discussions with the right people! I have done it for some of my older apps, and would be happy to do it again.JMC:Finally, do you have any messages to Bitcoin Magazine readersIt’s slated for release in mid-late November.

    "text": "Ross Ulbricht, alleged Silk Road HBIC, is claiming that new federal bitcoin laws classifying bitcoin as assets and not money invalidate the money laundering charges he faces. In short, he argues that you can’t launder money if you’re not using it.Earlier this year, Robert Faiella, 52, and Charlie Shrem, 24, were arrested on federal money laundering charges for their bitcoin activity on Silk Road. It would stand to reason that if Ulbricht did not break anti-money laundering laws, they didn’t either. The two allegedly sold more than $1 million in bitcoin to Silk Road users. Selling assets isn’t money laundering.The defense also brings up the wisdom of keeping money laundering laws on the books in the first place. If money laundering laws are worth their compliance costs and the erosion of privacy they create, surely they are worth enforcing fairly and should apply to Bitcoin as well, since it’s clearly a medium of exchange which can be used for criminal enterprises.However, the evidence is extremely clear that the laws aren’t worth it. Anti-money laundering efforts in Europe and North America cost billionsaccording to the Economist, and the magazine deems the laws a costly failure at trying to keep people from financing terror. Efforts to stamp out money laundering also erode privacy. “Know your customer” laws force banks to be cops, essentially conscripting private businesses “into agents of the surveillance state,” according to the American Civil Liberties Union.Bitcoin, on the other hand, makes all transactions public, which is a level of transparency not seen in other currencies.Ulbricht was arrested last October in San Francisco and accused of running the online marketplace under the name \"Dread Pirate Roberts.\" His lawyers are arguing as well that the hacking, narcotics trafficking, and criminal conspiracy charges against him in connection with the site are \"unconstitutionally broad\" and can't be applied to the normal operation of a website.Ultimately, providing a violence-free marketplace for drugs and selling bitcoins are victimless crimes, completely and totally unworthy of prison time or punishment. While classifying bitcoins as assets as opposed to currency makes no logical sense, hopefully it will help free these people from prison and help erode the remaining misplaced support for deleterious legislation against money laundering.",

    "text": "When I first heard of Julia, she called me a bitch. Her voice was so clear, so loud, and so crisp.I was taken aback, (right away, I might add) Her words were so truthful; I felt angry, and sad.I thought I “got” bitcoin! It’s the future of finance! I should want to teach governments and give them a chance!How to deal with this chick, she challenges all that I know… Do I hate her, embrace her, or meet her and grow?Her Vines are mesmerizing, she speaks without fear. Her thoughts are so radical, with an odd kind of cheer.I reach out over Facebook and propose meeting up, She gets back to me quickly, and says, simply, “yup.”The first time we meet was quite a surprise. She hugged me, showed happiness; I felt like a prize!We bonded quite quickly, we talked over drinks, “This girl has mad brains, I’ll record all her thinks.”She took me shooting – taught me to shoot trap I peeked in her head; now there’s no going back…“So bitcoin,” I said, “tell me how you got in?” “Well, where do I start?” I said, “just begin.”First, she tried to buy drugs on the fated Silk Road, but chickened out before buying as she lives with her folks.Then, at the Expo, she met up with Amir, heard Andreas’ speech and Bitcoin became clear.“Bitcoin’s empowerment! I’ll listen to them,”; she wanted to learn more, so she met Charlie Shrem.New York taught her much and the gears started turning – moment by moment, Julia was learning.She was a bitch but she made the transition, because she tapped into knowledge and she chose to listen.“Everything new is treated with fear: the bicycle, the car, it’s all just so clear.”She listens, she listens, seeks out all honesty and realizes that Bitcoin = economic sovereignty.Julia Tourianski – painted by Y.T. Coin Artist (Marguerite Torres)Born in Yeysk, Russia, she knows of corruption. Her dad paid two governments* to avoid any disruption.Home-schooled by her mom, they lived a good life, but the *mafia’s taxes creates trouble and strife.She and her family, younger sister in tow, left post-USSR Russia for Canada – to grow.Her dad’s manual labour allowed the family to live – her father worked construction to come home and give.A Libertarian for a while, she then learned about anarchy – her lifestyle came first, then came her philosophy.“Labels can limit, but they can also empower. But centralized, imposed ruling makes people cower.”Anarchy – for her – is a lifestyle of freedom! “Leave the people alone! Then our earth can be eden.”“But statists be like, ‘who will build the roads?’ Private corps. already do this, that’s just how it goes.”No aggression, no rulers, don’t provide the solutions. Just empower the humans, dismantle institutions.Problems are solved day by day, bottom up, not top-down, by rulers, as central power corrupts.The only way this works is to break up into states who can choose their own leaders!”, Julia postulates.“We must live cooperatively, community-based. For an ethical revolution, that must be the base.”“No communism or socialism, let’s be individuals. This is why p2p is so beautiful: we’re all equal citizens.We function in communities, worldwide but still small. We can work without centralized rulers, or top-down control.Let’s be like the Wildlings! They all live in tribes. In control of who they follow, they’re in control of their lives.If they don’t like their rulers they’re allowed to break free. They aren’t held to their leader, or by any decree.”The scariest thing to Julia is so crystal clear: this emerging ‘New World Order’ is the base of her fear.“The most terrifying thing is unifying us all. When you centralize the power, individuals become small.No nations! No states! Just communities that compete! (And that’s not a bad thing as it dismantles the elite.)Why can’t we all butt heads and follow who we CHOOSE? Instead of imposed, corrupt rule where 99 of us lose?Bitcoin is power; we vote with our money. If you love England’s queen, then use the pound, honey.If you support individuals, then use cryptocurrency, because times, they’re a changin- and we’re living in urgency.”Julia is no fool. Her eyes are wide open. She flies off to Bilderberg to protest the broken.We bond over Andreas, and we both have hope. We both love Bitcoin; she thinks it’s, quote, “dope.”“Use the internet,” she says, “to build your own life, fund your family’s travel, avoid 9-5 strife.People jump into moulds of social engineering, but a new form of lifestyle is quickly appearing.”So keep speaking up, keep speaking your truth! Don’t give in, don’t apologize, empower our youth!Don’t pander to governments, or foundations or organizations! We are returning to communities and dismantling nations!Bitcoin is pure but it’s facing ‘correction’ And that’s taking it into a different direction.It’s not meant for the system! That’s why it was invented! We don’t need it approved! We don’t need it consented!”Julia’s optimistic. She’s now full of hope. An artist and philosopher, she’s not one to mope.She’s a fighter, a truth teller, and she does give a f*ck: “Just teach the people –education gets them unstuck.When we replace empathy onto the shoulders governments, we achieve simply nothing and remain in strict covenants.So take back the power and just BE GOOD. When we teach men to fish, personal power is understood.”Bitcoin is the key to the lock to the door …we are waiting to open it, and we are waiting no more.Feature image painted by Y.T. Coin Artist.

    "text": "by Erica and Stefan Armstrong (wife and husband accounting team) and David MondrusOpen ledger accounting has the potential to make accounting more accurate and simpler than ever.One of the problems with accounting as it currently stands is its inability to provide 100% accuracy. This might be surprising for those not actively managing books day to day, but the details of transactions, the speed with which they move and the complexity of their classification means that 100 accuracy is far from certain.For example, a large bank has thousands of transactions a day that they have to balance to cash. They simply can’t balance to the penny every day. It takes too much time and would cost too much. Over time this adds up to the bank being out by millions of dollars. But, if transactions were automatically posted to an automated block ledger when the transaction took place the ledger would always be right. This would save companies time and be more accurate as you would not be able to actually conduct the transaction without the tracking.How would this work? Well, essentially the company’s accounting department would “spin up” an internal company coin when they opened their books. This coin would be convertible to Bitcoin or whichever Crypto currency is prevalent, but would only be able to be used internally. They would then distribute this coin according to the annual budget. As departments interact with external suppliers, the payments are made through the accounts payable office, but in a fully automated fashion. That is the department’s purchase normally, but pay via an automated internal coin -> BTC converter. Internal departments payments are of coursed handled without the need to convert. Once the books were closed for the fiscal year, all coins would convert to Bitcoin to mark to market for the last time, and that coin would be closed. Then the cycle begins again.This method guarantees internal transaction integrity, transparency and accountabilityLess transactions errors: Currently, all transactions for a company must be entered manually. This means that if a bank account balance is off at the end of the month, you have to figure it out, and there’s an incentive to “fudge” the reason. If transactions were automatically posted as soon as they were completed, this could no longer happen.Full transaction auditing: Currently an auditor can only test a percentage of transactions in the system as it’s cost prohibitive to verify each transaction. But with an open ledger accounting system, auditors could simply monitor the system.Real time financials: By tying the internal ledger to a reporting system that aggregates and rolls up the data, a company can track their financials in real time.Better risk management: Real time financials allow for better risk management through automated asset allocation, re-balancing and exposure monitoring.Better credit worthiness management: Currently we must rely on 3rd party credit rating agencies to advise us of the quality of a business customer. Access to a verified transaction chain means we no longer need to rely on people to make a decision on our behalf. We can now see and trust the data we see enough to make our own credit worthiness decisions.Cheaper and better public company accounting: The open ledger accounting methodology could be used to create real time financials for publicly traded companies allowing everyone to review the company’s transactions. This significantly reduces public disclosure compliance costs, and reduces the risk of “off balance sheet accounting”. Simply, it makes another Enron or Bernie Madoff become much less likely.To be sure, there are both risks and complications with this method.Most companiesaren’tgoing to have the technology to “spin up” their own coin. They also can’t do their own mining anyway, since this removes the chain credibility. They will have to reward the coin miners in some way, this will obviously cost $.Additionally, this method also leaks information that the company might not want to share. We think this concern can be reduced through appropriate level aggregations, but an aggregation too high removes the transparency.Also this does not address simple dishonesty, or the classification problem, although we expect that very quickly that will become a non-issue through an emergent implicit agreement on classification standards.Finally there’s the sheer inertia and complexity of it all. Accountants are not exactly known for their breakneck charge of innovation adoption, GAAP standards took years to lock down and FASB and IASB will have a say in how this is monitored, measured, controlled and accounted for.But we think that in the same way that the accounting profession adopted every other time and money saving technique to do their craft, aftert hey’ve understood the implications of this technology, and its veracity, utility and cost savings are demonstrated they will flock to it, well, like accountants to accounting.",

    "text": "Bitcoin may be coming to a gas station near you thanks to Andy Schroder’s Bitcoin Fluid Dispenser II. For commodities like oil and gas, this innovation could help streamline the end of the supply chain and in turn, increase the usability of cryptocurrencies. So far, there are a few companies at the forefront of Bitcoin technology in the oil and gas industry. Recently, Texas based oil and gas data company Oilfield Intel LLC announced in March that it would accept Bitcoin, becoming the first provider in the industry to do so. The Cosmic Market in Greeley, Colorado announced in December that it would be accepting bitcoin at its retail gas station and convenience store manually at their cashier. However, the most exciting developments in the industry concerning Bitcoin are the inventions like Andy Schroder’s that change the interaction when we as consumers obtain commodities that we use everyday, like gasoline. Bitcoin provides an alternative to the status quo in this industry, which if it could be used in the entire supply chain without the need for currency exchanges, could help reduce some of the challenges and tension involved with global fuel trade by removing the reliance on the “petro dollar.”Andy Schroder is heavily involved in many projects that explore solar energy and power cycles, in addition to heat transfer research. He has used his engineering experience and passion for Bitcoin to create The Bitcoin Fluid Dispenser II, which allows customers to pay for gas from a self operating machine using Bitcoin. The device itself looks identical to a modern fuel pump only with slight modifications, most notably, a large screen that allows users to view the cost of the fuel, scan a Bitcoin payment address, and keep track of how much has been pumped. Much like pre-paying in cash at your neighborhood gas station, users pre-pay at the pump with their Bitcoin wallet and receive change automatically for any unused credit when they are done pumping. Simply scan the QR code on the pump and send mBTC (millibits) from your mobile device. Once the pump receives the payment you can begin fueling.You can already buy gas with gift cards purchased with Bitcoin, but buying gift cards or prepaid debit cards with Bitcoin means retailers are still relying on a credit card system, instead of using Bitcoin to do what it is made to do: eliminate fraud, provide faster payments, eliminate the need to store cash from the point of sale, and decrease per transaction cost. Schroder’s innovation allows both retailers and consumers to take advantage of all the benefits of bitcoin, while still maintaining the conveniences of a credit card based sale.Schroder believes in the importance of trading consumable commodities with Bitcoin, and thinks that it may help reduce volatility and increase adoption. “Some economists share the belief that a continually inflating currency is needed to encourage trade and maintain an active economy, because in an inflationary monetary system if you don’t use your store of value, you lose it, which promotes spending,” Schroder stated. “However, within the cryptocurrency Austrian economics communities, many have grown frustrated with continually inflating monetary systems because it is considered a form of theft from the people by the central bankers.” Instead, Schroder believes that if commodities that are needed to sustain our everyday lives and businesses can be purchased directly with bitcoin, that the market can thrive with a deflationary currency like Bitcoin.Making a fuel purchase directly with Bitcoin means that you never have to leave the pump, pre-pay with cash, or share important credit card and personal information. Bitcoin could enable the global trade of consumable commodities like oil and gas without having to rely on currency exchanges or an inflationary monetary system. Hopefully the oil and gas industry will embrace bitcoin and can close this loop. If they do, maybe other industries will follow suit, further propelling bitcoin into mainstream use and making it something much more than just a speculative asset.",

    "title": "Richard Ravenhawke is sitting across from me, on his Android phone, as I type this. He has a great energy",
    "text": "Richard Ravenhawke is sitting across from me, on his Android phone, as I type this. He has a great energy about him, very relaxed. He wears a big claw around his neck, on a thick gold chain. His eyes are kind, and he’s been through a lot in his life on this earth.We’re sitting in my living room, and he’s currently talking to me about how people pay him for his services.“I went to your site and input my Visa number…” he says, out loud, reading an e-mail from a client. “Trusting, aren’t we? To just give over all this personal information to someone we don’t even really know?” he expresses to me. I nod.Ravenhawke found me through a friend, and he wanted me to help show him how Bitcoin works and how to accept it as a form of payment. His interest in bitcoin came from a personal fascination with the deep web (where bitcoin is prominent) and the dark side of life, but the more he hears about it and learns about it, the more his interest grows into its other, non deep-web, applications. We agreed to meet so I could show him how to accept bitcoin for his services after he found out about the cost – or lack thereof – of doing so.“I have clients all around the world, all across Canada, and in China… the Chinese just love me,” he says. In fact, Ravenhawke estimates 40 of his clients are international. He spent one year on Fairchild Radio, and was syndicated in 5 Asian countries with 3 million listeners tuning in to his show, which aired once a month. Ravenhawke also wrote a daily horoscope column, and it was, by his estimate, the most syndicated psychic column on the Internet in 2001/2002.As such, Ravenhawke deals with international payments frequently and has had his fair share of frustrations with current payment options available to him and his clients.“PayPal, which is, of course, Visa and Mastercard, is the most prominent way I get paid from international clients,” Ravenhawke discloses. “Transactions are smooth, but it takes 3-5 days for the money to download into my account. So, when you’re doing budgeting based on what’s coming in and what’s going out, it makes it harder when you have to add in the factor of what you’re waiting for.”Settlement time is a big reason Ravenhawke prefers cash and Interac e-money transfers (only available between Canadian bank accounts, at a limit or $1000/day for a $1.50 CAD fee, with a 45-minute settlement time) over cheques and PayPal.But it doesn’t stop there. Candidly, Ravenhawke explains his frustration when, after many failed attempts at logging into his former PayPal account, the company simply shut down his access to funds and he was never able to recover the money.“They took $4,000 CAD from me a few years ago. I forgot my password, tried to log in a few times, and oops! Now I have to go through a gazillion steps to recover my account. I wrote in, and they got back to me and then one day they just stopped getting back to me. [PayPal] is obviously aware that cross-border lawsuits over $4,000 are not worth my time, and they just never gave [the money] back.”Ever since that experience, Ravenhawke downloads all his PayPal money (after he waits 3-5 days) into his bank account to ensure this type of thing never happens again. He ensures I understand how frustrated he is with PayPal with a final statement: “the ONLY reason I use PayPal is become of clients overseas. There is no other way.”Wire transfers are another option, but of course this requires in-person time, paperwork, a ton of information, and quite a hefty fee.Bitcoin is the first option Ravenhawke has seen that saves time, saves money, is convenient, and allows him the potential to even make money on its value.Knowing how perfect bitcoin would be for a business such as Ravenhawke’s, I jumped at the opportunity to trade my bitcoin consulting services for his psychic services.How cool is that? I get to see a glimpse into my past, or future, by doing something I love: encouraging adoption of Bitcoin technology and setting up a wallet and a better payment option for someone who can benefit from it.Ravenhawke is the first psychic I know of who accepts bitcoin. “Primarily, I am a psychic,” he explains. “I’m not a reader. Anyone can memorize meanings of cards. I am not an interpreter. When I read people, I don’t use anything. I tune into your energy, and I see visions about your life.”My reading with Ravenhawke was interesting. He held a personal object of mine and went into a trance. “I get quiet sometimes when I do it,” he explains. “It’s like … talking to someone who is daydreaming. It’s like I am watching TV. I’m gone, but I’m still here. When I figure out what I’ve seen and what I want to say, I come back.”Indeed, this was my experience, and it was really cool. He called my past out to a T and gave me some interesting insights into my future, like how I will be married in 6 summers. (my mother will be pleased to hear this!)My friend also received a reading from him, and came out, stunned. “There’s no way he could have known all of that,” he said. “This guy is for real.” He was pretty shaken, but in a good way, he said.“I never say anything unless I am absolutely, 100 sure it is what I want to say,” Ravenhawke adds, laughing. (My mom will like that, too.) He adds, “If everyone did that, the world would be a better place.”Ravenhawke and I have discussed bitcoin in many meetings, and his interest is deepening quickly. It’s really not just a payment system for him: “I see [bitcoin] as the new revenue stream of the future. It’s young right now, but who knows. Maybe my son will be Prime Minister one day, but he’s still in grade 5. That’s how I see bitcoin. It’s still young; the potential is there.”Ravenhawke sees society as becoming more and more high-tech, with less and less people carrying cash. He’s right – an estimated 95 of our money is digital. “You can’t rely on plastic,” he adds. “How many times have people gone to pay with their cards and seen a sign saying ‘Cash Only – System Down’? It’s funny. When the system is down, the web is still working on my phone.”I set Ravenhawke up with my favorite wallet, Blockchain.info, linked his web wallet to his phone, and we did a test transaction. Then we updated his site with a big “Bitcoin Accepted Here!” sign and instructions for his international clients who wish to use bitcoin to pay him for his services.Ravenhawke reads people from all walks of life, “from politicians right down to janitors”, he says.“It will be interesting to see where bitcoin will go,” Ravenhawke concludes. “I think what it does for people’s finances will be much better than anything else we have in place now.”You can request a reading from Richard Ravenhawke by going to his website: richardravenhawke.yolasite.com or e-mail richardravenhawke@yahoo.com.And, of course, he accepts bitcoin.",

    "text": "A video making the rounds lately called “True Wealth” that targets older investors with doom and gloom misrepresentations of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The video is from the notoriously fear-mongering group Stansberry Research who released a similar one a few years ago warning of impending economic collapse. It is important to address the claims in these videos as they are targeting an older demographic that is already hesitant towards getting involved in bitcoin and, thanks to the video, for all the wrong reasons. Not only are fallacies used repeatedly throughout the video, but the advice is terrible from an investing standpoint.First of all, the format is unlike regular videos you would see on other sites; you are not allowed to skip past the hyperbole and get to the point. This is by careful design because the video is very long and uses emotionally manipulative techniques to draw the viewer in while concealing supposedly useful information about investing in a mysterious “secret” currency that the super-wealthy have invested in for centuries. The narrator name drops such families as the Rothschilds and Morgans to add to the allure of this investment, but it is all couched in an appeal to authority and bandwagon fallacy. The video compares Bitcoin to stocks of poorly launched companies that have failed in the past and repeats the argument that those first to market usually fail. If you can sit through it, which I begrudgingly did weeks ago after it was sent to my boss, you finally find out this “secret” currency that promises untold wealth is *spoiler alert* numismatic collectible coins. My perspective on this issue is uniquely influenced by my position as an office manager at Roberts & Roberts Brokerage, a precious metals brokerage in Pensacola that takes bitcoin. We advise people to invest in physical bullion and the president, Tim Frey, frequently advises against investing in numismatic coins for a few reasons.Numismatic coins are sometimes rare or common date coins that have been graded and placed in a nice looking case. They sell for high premiums over the melt value of gold, but require constant attention to the market that few people are able to expend especially those looking to simply invest in gold as a hedge against inflation. In a transcript the Stansberry video was based on, they refer to numismatic coins as “rare,” and while this is true of some coins, many of them are very common. The distinction takes a lot of time spent on research, and more common coins are often sold for a retail value far above their wholesale value; truly rare coins are the exception.So, we see the old bait and switch in the video and transcript where they discuss truly rare coins then segue into trying to sell numismatic coins that aren’t as rare as one may think. You can view how many common date numismatic coins have been graded on the website of PCGS.Stansberry Research is trying to get you to invest in coins whose values have dropped as much 89 of their premium above melt. Melt value is the value of the precious metal in an object based on the spot price, which is the price per troy ounce on the commodity market.The value of numismatics has dropped dramatically over the past decade and differ from bullion in that they have much higher premiums and also slightly less gold. It wouldn’t be fair to only attack the way Stansberry is dispensing this information, so let’s crunch some numbers. One example of declining numismatics is the $5 MS64 Liberty, a gold coin that sold in 2005 for a whopping 1236.52 over the melt value of $101.76. By 2013, the premium was 143.42 over a melt value of $402.60. Another example is the $5 MS64 Indian that reached a peak of 2872.77 over a melt value of $101.76 then plummeted to 18.48 over $402.60. When the spot value of gold increases, premiums for these coins fall and so far they have yet to recover. But don’t take my word for it; you can view the data here.The video bashes bitcoin, but just in the last year we’ve seen an increase of 5000 and even more since bitcoin came on the scene in 2008. While volatility is always a concern, numismatics simply don’t hold up to bitcoin as a store of value as premiums have dropped considerably and are showing no sign of recovery whereas the protocol functions of the Bitcoin network offer innovations we can look forward to aside from its value as a currency.Another case for bitcoin is that they are actually rare as opposed to many of the coins being called numismatic. There are only 21 million that can ever be created and some have already been lost. If you combine the limited quantity with the increasing amount of work needed to mine bitcoin, you have a currency/protocol that is set to increase in value over time as they become more rare and demand increases. In the five years since bitcoin has been around, interest has only grown, and with the advent of new businesses accepting it and new apps being launched it is expected to continue.There are a few other problems with the video, as well. The coin collecting business is quite literally dying out. Collecting truly rare coins is a hobby that is very time consuming and decreasing among younger generations. At one time coin collectors outnumbered numismatic coins, but the numbers have been gradually declining and we now see more coins than collectors.We see this all the time at the brokerage; a family inherits a bunch of numismatic coins and sells them off immediately or an older collector brings them in—they are often surprised at how much their value has declined because they haven’t done the meticulous research required. Many people get sold overpriced numismatic coins that are actually looking for bullion, which has lower premiums and is more reflective of the actual market price of gold. Younger generations have little interest in coin collecting as a hobby and the only people stuck with these numismatics are much older collectors. The large coin collecting house Heritage even refuses to buy most of these coins because they have so many already and more coins are being graded and added to the mix that aren’t actually rare dates. More coins and fewer collectors creates a market that is drying up due to decreased demand.Numismatics are a relic of an older time where information could be bought for the right price, but we’ve grown accustomed to free information in the age of the internet—you can read the source code for Bitcoin and Satoshi’s white paper. It’s out there and transparent for everyone to see, without having to use gimmicks and manipulation to sell you on it. While it’s my personal belief that Bitcoin is a groundbreaking innovation to get involved in, I urge everyone to do their own research.Young people would rather have an investment that is versatile, if they have any money to invest whatsoever, and bitcoin fills this position far better than numismatics. You are not investing in just a currency, but an idea as well. Bitcoin as a network has value whether or not the currency remains at a high dollar price. We are witnessing the beginning of a new way to foment contracts between parties and send other information with the rise of cryptographic innovations.Another feature of bitcoin that is appealing to Millennials is the divisible nature of bitcoin. You can buy as much as you can afford at the time rather than paying nearly $1,400 for a numismatic coin with a dubious future and rocky recent past. The coin collecting industry has been trying hard to encourage investment in these coins, but if you do the research, it is because they have an overabundance of them that they can sell for a very high markup above wholesale to people who are less experienced in coin collecting. If you must buy numismatics, find a place that sells them for wholesale. You have to use fear and deception to sell numismatics and that may be why Stansberry Research produced this misleading video; as with all things, follow the money. The company is selling you fear and for a low, low subscription price you can find out all of their investment “secrets”. Sound suspicious? If you have to pay money for sacred information, perhaps you should evaluate what the source stands to gain. By selling you overpriced numismatics; Stansberry could make a small fortune—even more if you are scared into their subscription scheme. If the tone and content of the video wasn’t enough to turn people away, Stansberry is also no stranger to controversy; in 2007 the founder Porter Stansberry was found guilty of fraud and ordered to pay $1.5 million in penalties. He has also been involved in other questionable schemes. As my suspicions confirmed, the company seems to be using the same tactics that have historically caused past clients to lose massive amounts of money.For all the wailing about bitcoin being a Ponzi scheme, it has historically been those privy to classified information that have run them to rip people off. This mentality is nothing new in the coin collecting and even precious metals industry; even the U.S. Mint sells coins for far above their face value because of the special label “collectible”, but I guarantee you that if you tried to sell them to a dealer for the same price you’d be laughed out of the office. The same is true unfortunately for numismatics, and the target audience for Stansberry’s video are older generations, some of which could be easily fooled by the seemingly high production value of the video and its histrionic promises. Bitcoin is for everyone and easily accessible even for those averse to technology. So the next time you see this video circulating, you can reassure them that bitcoin isn’t the threat Stansberry makes it out to be—at least not in the way they think of it. ",

    "text": "Billionaire entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, whose Virgin Galactic airlines was the first to accept bitcoins for space flight, recently describedbitcoin as “the pioneer of a global currency” in an interview in the April issue of Delta’s SKY Magazine. Branson clearly believes in bitcoin. Not only is he accepting it, but he’s invested in it as well. But his comments indicate that he does not believe bitcoin will be the ultimate winner in the cryptocurrency wars.“It may not be the perfect global currency of the future yet, but it’s the pioneer of a global currency,” Branson said.He joins other tech giants in his assessment. “The Foundation is involved in digital money but unlike Bitcoin it would not be anonymous digital money,” Bill Gates said in February. “In Kenya M-PESA is being used for almost half of all transactions.”Gates, Branson, and Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and CEO of Square all believe any successful online payments system will need more transparency than bitcoin currently offers.So what “transparency” does M-PESA offer that bitcoin doesn’t?Well, first, all customers must provide M-PESA an original identification document in order to open an account. Retailers who accept M-PESA are trained and required to check customers’ ID cards every time they make a purchase and each purchase requires a three-factor authentication involving ID, the SIM card, and a PIN.Like bitcoin, every single transaction in M-PESA is recorded and can be monitored by Safaricom, along with the location of the device used in the transaction. Safaricom runs what it calls bank-grade anti-money laundering checks, and sends regular reports to the Central Bank of Kenya.Between the value of customer data and how much easier it makes anti-money laundering reporting, it’s clear why Gates, Branson, and Dorsey might be interested in such transparency. However, there is a tension between transparency and security. One of the reasons bitcoin transactions are by-default more secure than credit card purchases is that its transactions involve transmissions of personal data.In addition, while bitcoin transactions are by-default only semi-anonymous, some bitcoin users appreciate the privacy of the fully anonymous transactions bitcoin makes possible.Like Friendster and Myspace, bitcoin is probably not the be-all and end-all of decentralized, peer-to-peer online currencies. But it’s impossible to know what exactly the Facebook of cryptocurrency will look like. Only time will tell if transparency is something customers will value as much as entrepreneurs.",

    "title": "Ancient Greek philosophers learned the importance of dreams: that dreams tied into our reality somehow, but notably that we must",
    "text": "Ancient Greek philosophers learned the importance of dreams: that dreams tied into our reality somehow, but notably that we must first dream of something before we can make it reality. Man told stories and dreamed of flying to the moon, and then with dreams created for generation after generation, we achieved it.Marked by Neil Armstrong’s famous words “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”Bitcoin was a dream, the want and need for change, born from a desire burning in everyone. For if what Bitcoin brings and promises was not what we all desired, then surely, for whatever our reasons, we would not be drawn to it as we are.For many of us the start of the internet was around 1995-1996, though it was birthed much earlier than that through the ARPANET, and dreams before that of radio and telecommunications (telegraphy). The list can go on, but it all seems to carry the same theme, better and faster communication with other people. The dream in this case could be understood to be reaching towards a type 1 civilization form of communication (see: The Kardashev Scale), in that we use the planet’s energy to facilitate communication, radio waves, internet. What can be seen from our history is that anything which enables us to travel and communicate more efficiently with each other, whether personally, business and especially within the financial world, tends to have long lasting effects.But then here I like to draw a line, which leaves everything we knew behind and brings Bitcoin, most notably, the Protocol, in a new level of understanding and ordering of society. What is the dream of Bitcoin? Is it to be a new type of money, to coincide with fiat, or replace it? And then there are those of us that point out at each opportunity that the Protocol is more than just ‘Bitcoin’ the currency, and that we have not seen anything yet.For some the dream is a ‘get rich quick’ scheme; the scammers and thieves and hackers that they tell you about, similar to bogey men – “if you’re not careful they’ll come and get you!” Except in this case, it’s very true (you should always enable 2fa and keep security in mind); there is unfortunately this unwanted element of society that is attracted to Bitcoin.All new and old in the bitcoin sector should remain wary of interacting with PayPal with regards to bitcoin; there are many tales of people being scammed through PayPal.Yet it can be said, same as all previous valuable commodities and monies, silver, gold, diamonds and similar, have been made targets by pirates, bandits, crooks and criminals. It can be argued that this is a tried and tested way to tell that something is working, and this particular thing may be worth looking into and keeping tabs on.The Alternative?Is the dream an alternative to the current banking system and economic dilemma? A solution to an escalating global dilemma through an amazing technological achievement, as some argue. At the moment, people mostly look on it as a different form of money; wait until more people realise that it (the protocol) can be used for so much more – it is internet phase 2.0.When we think about the internet as a tool for communication on an energy (radio waves) basis, and through this form of communication, we can discuss, offer trade, and give services. However, we never had a tool to transfer wealth or assets through this amazing form of communication.Cryptocurrency fills this gap. The dream of transferring wealth across the planet in the same way was finally achieved in 2009. Credit cards and the fiat system were never designed to operate over the internet; how they have existed has just been a band-aid on a far more technologically advanced system.For example, introducing the printing press is comparable to introducing the internet, an upgrade from fiat money to digital. And as we know, we introduced paper (cotton) money with the printing press, and Bitcoin is the next stage evolution of introducing digital money with digital communication. So is the dream one of communication in finance and business? Many are the complaints of the time delays and errors when using the traditional wire transfer model. Add the costs with complications of the traditional financial system and potential for fraud, we can see why a dream of a better system has come about.Another angle that has been brought up occasionally is the political spectrum.When it is time, after a certain amount of global adoption, a political party will fully adopt Bitcoin and entrench it within their mandates. The start of a significant societal evolution will quickly follow the political evolution, and it will be most interesting to witness.What would a traditional political party be with full transparency of political accounts? What if the law was that any donations not identified on the Blockchain had to be sent to charities and to public sector services. And any funds a party sends through a tumbler is also enforced by law to be sent to a charity, and likely the party would be held suspect by the people.And we, the people, can all view the Blockchain, whenever we want.The emerging business sector, and additional business and banking for all the unbanked (estimated in the billions), they have their own dream now made possible with Bitcoin.From time to time it comes up in a discussion whether in person, on forums, or via other means of communication. What are the intentions of Bitcoin and the Protocol, or rather, what were the intentions of the creator for the tool that was made?Unintended consequences are always on the mind of the long term planner. Witnessing the developing altcoin phenomena, we can see that charity and the feeling of community seems to be rather paramount. The potential for a thousand people to give as little as they wish, the equivalent of pennies (or cents if you’re that way inclined) to benefit those in need, such as Sean’s Outpost that works for the homeless, or as the recent charity drive for the wrongly accused Dorian Nakamoto shows, funds can be raised quickly and directly in support.The potential for charity work is world changing. Being able to give funds directly to an individual who has suffered through a disaster would enrich people the world over. Could it be said that it is a dream of sons and daughters the world over who often send money to relatives or friends, that it could be done with such ease and zero to little expense (admittedly a tiny bit of expense if you include a transaction fee, which is generally recommended to support the miners).Recently a friend linked a YouTube video – Solar Freakin’ Roadways is the title. And yes, you guessed it, it is about solar freakin’ roadways. Following was a discussion about how such a thing could be operated with a Cryptocurrency payment system in a decentralised manner. A particular roadway could consist of a number of individuals paying for panels as a group or individually (all manner of kickstarter and crowdfunding emerging these days). This particular project fundraising via kickstarter ended on June 20th and raised over $2 million.Imagine decentralised ownership, users providing a toll road payment via Bitcoin or another relevant Cryptocurrency, and this fee being distributed automatically amongst all the ‘shareholders’. And each shareholder would of course be gaining a return from the solar energy that was being distributed to the local area.And if a combined project like this was worked out to be profitable, then it would see exponential growth, and this may go quite a way to solving energy problems, every roadway turned into a solar panel. Direct payment and distribution made possible by Cryptocurrency.Personally I did not even imagine such a concept as solar roadways until a friend linked the video. It makes me wonder what else we can dream of that is just around the corner.FreedomFor many on the liberalist economic side, the concept of a peer2peer finance system independent from the machinations and influences of bank and government is the ‘dream of freedom’, and what is freedom but the ability to control one’s own destiny.Though we can have our liberty taken or hindered by a myriad of alternative methods, financial freedom is often looked at as a key factor to achieving this long sought after freedom.Through traditional and current financial systems, the exclusion of individuals, or even whole countries, such as UK with regard to Iran:Iran is currently subject to financial sanctions. This document contains the current list of designated persons relating to proliferation sensitive nuclear activities.~ HM TreasuryAnd even governments may soon understand the power of freedom of finance behind bitcoin and Cryptocurrency. As tensions heat up in Ukraine, Visa and Mastercard obeyed the western powers and blocked Russian transactions and key individuals, with the west using economic strangleholds to try to force Russia to back out of Ukraine as it tears itself apart.Recent legal changes within Russia, requiring “foreign credit operators will have to pay a fee of 25 percent of average daily turnover to the (Russian) Central Bank” – and that from July 1st (2014) “Visa and MasterCard can no longer block Russian clients.”As to whether or not Visa and MasterCard will obey the recent Russian laws with regards to servicing Russian clientele remains to be seen. And would they (Visa/Mastercard) counter play against the estimated $1.9 billion for Visa and $1 billion for MasterCard that will come from the 25 percent fee by raising fees for Russian clients?Is the dream of financial freedom for individuals and for governments moving closer to a reality? Within the last year the Russian central bank has gone from ‘banning’ bitcoin to a recent statement from the central Russian bank that they may now ‘legalise’ bitcoin.Note: No government in the world has (yet) made a law or even stated that trading in Bitcoin or other Cryptocurrency is illegal.Banks have strong influences, more so in some countries than others, but in no country in this world do banks have the power to create law at whim; they cannot simply say “Bitcoin is banned!” and have it banned in their respective countries.Banks do not create laws; they can lobby, and undoubtedly they have considerable weight when influencing laws, but there is a process that must be adhered to.As Russia is discovering with the recent financial sanctions levied against their country, the dream of freedom, freedom from control for individuals, businesses, or for governments, is not just for us but for the masses that rail at the rat maze that the banks hold us in.The emergence of global trade through financial freedom (Cryptocurrency) will be followed by trading freedom, and a new surge in economic growth. The growth of the internet has been strangled by inflation and the implementation of a transfer of wealth system that was not created with the internet in mind.Adoption of digital currency will enable someone from anywhere in the world to accept micro-payments, or more, from anyone else in the world without the need for an intermediary. When one person in Africa (or elsewhere) can receive funds directly for work or services without the loss of such funds through using a third party traditional sector, it will mean that there is a lot more wealth flowing freely around the world instead of being stolen and funneled to the select few.We may be years away from such a realisation, but the dream is there.ApplicationBitcoin the “currency” is just the first application of Blockchain technology. And it would become understood that this first integration of such a technology was inevitable considering its precursor and the global economic status at the time of its emergence.The open source nature enables applications of Blockchain technology that can be recognized in other scenarios, such as the world’s first virtual truly democratic voting system. Not only will every voice be heard on an issue, and that voice verified by cryptography, there will not be a need for congregations of people, who often seem to lead us into war.When an issue arises, and we are able to vote with a cryptographically secure system, giving a simple yes, no, maybe, within such a short time, from home, from our phones, from a library or anywhere that has an internet connection, then the application of Blockchain technology with regards to politics and virtual democracy be realised.There are almost as many cell-phone subscriptions (6.8 billion) as there are people on this earth (seven billion)—and it took a little more than 20 years for that to happen.~QuartzThe amount of funds spent on security for votes would be cut astronomically, and the trust in the system (when people understand how secure it would be) would enable the people to truly be represented.Visit your local government website. An issue has popped up, you have a given amount of days to cast a vote: send your Votecoin to the relevant address for Yesor No.And I hazard a guess that any current political party or potential party or individual that pushes for a 100 transparent and much more inclusive system would gain many votes from a despondent voting populace.The potential is out there, and there are very likely implementations we have not considered yet. Whilst other dreams and innovations are often hindered by a lack of funding or monopolizing and ‘buying out’, with Bitcoin is not only the dream of an alternative financial system, legal, political and business, but the decentralization factor lends itself to the dream of the incorruptible, a system of control and rules that is proactively inclusive, meaning that it pulls you in, sooner or later; its time has come.And what of other applications?Depending on how you are inclined you might not be dreaming of new businesses but of new opportunities for current businesses. Marc Andreessen and Balaji Srinivasan state numerous methods of integration for improvement: “…clearly the way to fix email spam was to have there be a micro charge for every message sent… 20 years ago we were talking about this idea we just had no way to implement the payment.”Remember, this is not just about Bitcoin as a currency, or even Bitcoin as a transfer of wealth. This is truly about the technology itself and its myriad potential of applications.Another beautiful thing about it is, is that the initial application of currency in the form of Bitcoin will fund all the other applications that are to come. Each application is a dream of doing something different, something better.A Dream Of PeaceOne of the arguments about an inflationary currency that can be created out of whim by governments and banks is that it provides a limitless supply of finance for war.Limitations in financial resources for governments act as a tether, a restraint. For if they (governments) were normally to divert their financial resources into providing funding for their war machines, then they would be left short of financial resources to provide for their country; their military expansions would be limited.Empires and military expansions tend to only be possible through inflation of the currency, to be able to afford to pay for extra troops. And this inflation means that they have to pay their current troops even more money to rise with inflation and keep their armies happy.A similar pattern of the contemporary world can be found in the dust of the Roman Empire.This is a self defeating prophecy that can only be stretched out by inflating the currency to its breaking point.Once the breaking point is reached, society collapses.It now costs the government about two cents to make a one cent piece, so the penny could be considered a commodity coin.~ The Coming End of Fiat Currency.If governments were not able to inflate their financial resources (Quantitative Easing) to ridiculous levels, or even at all, then logic dictates that there would be less war, if war would occur at all.With a limited financial resource, what country would risk the ire of their populace by squandering the limited finance on their war machines? It seems logical that they would instead reinvest the funds they do have, within their own country, to create a return that would enable them (the country) to keep functioning. And by these acts, the politicians are more likely to keep their positions.Also, it can be argued that within a finite system of finance, politicians and government officials who make the best use of the funds available are likely to serve longer terms and provide their society with a much better return for their money (taxes), instead of printing to oblivion to make up for the failures of the various political parties by attempting to plug the gaps in their own national systems.Though some argue that the excessive printing of monies is doing exactly what it is meant to do, allowing the 1 to buy up as much land and property as they can before the inevitable financial collapse, so that they can turn around and sell these properties to the next generation in the form of life debts.In the UK, the Bank of England began its “asset purchases” in January 2009.~ BBC NewsTranslation: The Bank of England is spamming its Print Money button and buying up as much property and land as it can ASAP.Is this a massive land and property grab before the fiat economy collapses?",

    "text": "I caught up with singer-songwriter and Bitcoin enthusiast, Tatiana Moroz, to talk about her experience at SXSW this year.—TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW—-Question: Tatiana, please tell us about yourself and your music.Tatiana: Hi my name is Tatiana Moroz and I’m a singer/songwriter from NJ. I have been singing as long as I can remember, I always knew what I wanted to do when I got older. I grew up listening to a lot of different kinds of singer/songwriters from the 60s and the 70s like Simon and Garfunkel, Cat Stevens, Carly Simons, Bob Dylan, and Neil Young, and I was really influenced by their ability to utilize music to bring about change in the world. The problem was that my generation didn’t really have anything we stood for. I later went to Berklee College of music and I started writing my own music. Around 2011 I got involved with the Ron Paul movement and I found exactly what I was looking for in terms of thought and philosophy that I wanted to bring people, and a political outlook and potentially a solution for a lot of the problems we were facing. I hadn’t seen any solutions in a long time and I felt that what Ron Paul was saying really resonated with me and a lot of other people. I thought that it was culturally inspiring, so I started writing music about that. I went to a lot of different events, I played for Ron Paul himself, events across the country and later around the world.Question: What is your involvement in the Bitcoin ecosystem?Tatiana: My involvement in the Bitcoin ecosystem started out in 2012 – Tony Gallippi from BitPay sponsored me at the Ron Paul festival down in Tampa for the RNC. At the time he was basically trying to evangelize Bitcoin to me which I had no idea what it was, at all. I did buy some coins from him and of course my interest increased as the value went up. It wasn’t until the crypto currency convention that Jeffrey Tucker threw in Atlanta in October of 2013 that I really started to understand the cultural impact that Bitcoin would have, and the ability it had to withdraw support for the state. That was something that wasn’t initially clear to me.What I did recognize at those conventions was the same enthusiasm that I felt when I first found Ron Paul, when people were still really helpful. That was really infectious and led to me to start educating myself more on Bitcoin. I decided Bitcoin should have some sort of song, you know I have written songs for other topics before. So I started out just writing a jingle. I played it for a friend of mine who is a huge Bitcoin enthusiast. He was like “this is OK, but I think you could do better, you’re missing the spirit of Bitcoin”. It pushed me to turn the jingle into a full fledged song. While the recording online is just a demo version, there is a full song version which I performed and debuted for the first time at the Buenos Aires Conference, which was the first Latin American Bitcoin Convention, in December. I had also previously played at the Crypto Convention at the BitPay Party in Atlanta back in October. After that I played at the Texas Bitcoin Conference and the Berlin Inside Bitcoins Conference. So yes, I’ve been to a lot of conferences and have been blessed to play at them.Question: How many Bitcoin related events did you attend during SXSW?Tatiana: On Wednesday night I did the Crypto Women’s Party which was at Lani on 6th and Congress. That was fun, I did a little set there. At the Conference itself Jordan Page and I performed at the Sean’s Outpost Charity Dinner that benefited the other charities as well. I was the moderator at the Social Media Panel and I participated in the music panel and the women’s panel. Later on that weekend I was on the women’s panel at the 512Bitcoin Mini Conference at Brave New Books. So yeah, I spoke at all of those and it was interesting because I’m not used to speaking so much. But I think that sometimes when it comes to Bitcoin it’s good to have people who aren’t that experienced with it because they offer a unique perspective and you can make people feel more comfortable, having someone coming from a normal person perspective can be more welcoming and reach out to a new demographic.Question: Were these events well attended?Tatiana: The events were well attended, for the most part. The Bitcoin Convention had a lot of attendance, especially the women’s ones.Question: Please describe your favorite Bitcoin related event while you were in town. Where was it, what was it about? Why did you love it so much?Tatiana: My favorite Bitcoin related event was actually the charity panel at the Bitcoin conference itself. It was at 9am the second day of the conference and I don’t think anyone was there that early, but I was because all my friends were speaking at the panel. I just thought the stories of what motivated people to start their charities and what motivated people to incorporate Bitcoin into them was really inspiring. I remember jotting down different notes about how I could write a song to express the awesomeness that I was hearing. I think when people hear of Bitcoin they don’t necessarily understand how it can be beneficial to charities. For example, you can give money directly to people and the charity doesn’t have to pay such large fees. If a charity chooses to hold on to their Bitcoin, there are hopes it will go up. Many charities sat on their Bitcoin and now it’s worth more than it was when it was donated and I think there is a lot of appeal to that. I think the Bitcoin charities are more about empowerment than handouts, so I really liked that. Of course, the anti-war message seems prevalent in at least half of them and its something I identify with and think should be kept in people’s minds.Question: Did you see any Bitcoin ATMs while in Austin?Tatiana: I saw two Bitcoin ATMS while in Austin. One was at Brave New Books, which is my favorite bookstore in Austin. I went on their crypto show (radio show on 90.1 put on by the Brave New Books crew). I also saw the one at the Handle Bar.Question: Do you think the general public is ready for Bitcoin after SXSW?Tatiana: After SXSW I think there are going to be a lot of new adopters to Bitcoin. There was a huge tech presence of course at the conference, and it seems that at the SXSW exhibit hall there was a lot of buzz about bitcoin, everyone wanted to know more. I think it will allow more people to join the Bitcoin ecosystem and to feel like they have a place they can start fitting in Bitcoin to help them run their business and expand their markets.Question: Did you send or receive any bitcoin while in Austin for SXSW?Tatiana: I paid for a couple meals with bitcoin while at SXSW, tacos with bitcoin, and pedi cabs. I also got some donations for my own project to do an album, hopefully completely paid for in bitcoin. That will be interesting to see if we can make it happen.Question: Why is Bitcoin so important, anyway?Tatiana: Bitcoin is important because it allows you to peacefully withdraw from the war machine. I think it’s going to revolutionize the way the world exchanges money, and it puts the money back in the pockets of the people. No one likes to be robbed, and that is genuinely what is going on when the Federal Reserve decides to print more dollars. We are funding the war and we are losing the value of what we already do have.",

    "text": "Back in December we reported that the United States Air Force has quietly been working on a Bitcoin payment gateway otherwise known as a “snack machine” (yes you read that correctly). We also discussed that “currency is like another class of supply, a commodity required to execute the battle.”Recently, United States sanctions against the Kremlin for annexing Ukraine resulted in MasterCard and Visa suspending certain types of transactions in Russia (apparently due to the OFAC 50 rule). OFAC or Office of Foreign Assets Control under the Department of U.S. Treasury maintains a list of different sanctions programs that it administers here.It has been reported that Visa did resume services with some Russian banks. I found an old SEC filing that may (or may not) shed some light how Visa is able to continue its relationship with certain banks under sanction:“…OFAC restricts financial dealings with Cuba, Iran, Myanmar and Sudan, as well as financial dealings with certain parties, such as identified money laundering fronts for terrorists or narcotics traffickers. While we prohibit financial institutions that are domiciled in those countries or are restricted parties from being Visa members, many Visa International members are non-U.S. financial institutions, and thus are not subject to OFAC restrictions. Accordingly, our payments system may be used for transactions in or involving countries or parties subject to OFAC-administered sanctions…”In any case, President Vladimir Putin now supports plans for Russia to create its own national payment system. Headlines such as “Russia Reconsiders Bitcoin?”have begun to sprout up and this week Russia will be hosting its first Bitcoin conference.US Army War CollegeThis should come to no surprise to those who read Juan C. Zarate’s“Conflict by Other Means: The Coming Financial Wars” (PDF) published by the US Army War College Strategic Studies Institute Quarterly Parameters in its Winter 2013-14 Issue. Mr. Zarate has been called “a chief architect of modern financial warfare” and is a Senior Adviser for the Transnational Threats Project and Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Program, CSIS Senior National Security Consultant and Analyst for CBS News. Mr. Zarate also authored the memoir “Treasury’s War: The Unleashing of a New Era of Financial Warfare” published by PublicAffairs.In “Conflict by Other Means: The Coming Financial Wars”, Zarate writes that:“Countries such as Russia and China will continue to challenge the dominance of the US-led international system and the dollar itself. If such attacks succeed, they could weaken the ability of the United States to affect or move private sector decision making in line with national security interests, regardless of what other governments do.”and further:“The domain of financial warfare will no longer remain the sole province of American power. A wide array of state and nonstate actors may step up to wield economic power and influence in the twenty-first century.”He discusses “Challenges to U.S. Financial Power” such as nontraditional currencies, Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS), Community Exchange System (CES), bartering (e.g. ITEX) and of course Bitcoin:“{Bad} actors have new digital tools {such as} bitcoin (BTC) …a digital currency …{which}… uses cryptography rather than central authorities to issue and transfer money. The result is that transactions are cheap, accounts cannot be frozen (unless users keep bitcoins in a separate third-party online wallet service), and there are no prerequisites or arbitrary limits for use…”“Radical connectivity is blurring national lines and facilitating the transfer of virtual currency between otherwise disparate non-state actors.”On March 19th (as amended April 10th), interested vendors began bidding on a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) project for the Technical Support Working Group (TSSWG) Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office (CTTSO) for the Navy Engineering Logistics Office of the Department of the Navy.Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) posting of Solicitation Number N41756-14-Q-3272 includes the keyword “bitcoin.” The BAA Includes “R3861: Counter Threat Finance” and “R3830 Methods and Means to Systematically Discern and Display ‘Precursors of Instability’ In The Dark Web.” These were introduced on January 30th in the unclassifiedPowerPoint presentationand corresponding “Advance Planning Briefing for Industry” (PDF) as part of a “Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats Mission” which includes “operational assessment, concept development, and independent validation of unique prototype capabilities to identify, confront, and defeat evolving threats.”Some may find it unusual that the Navy was one of the original developers of the Dark Web. However, “Tor was originally designed, implemented, and deployed as a third-generation onion routing project of the United States Naval Research Laboratory…for protecting government communications…” and provided funding from 2006 through 2010. Though I don’t find this any more unusual than the Internet itself starting out as a project from the (Defense) Advanced Research Projects Agency called ARPANET (see “DARPA and the Internet Revolution” [PDF]).The Dark Web has been part of Bitcoin’s “zeitgeist” since Adrien Chen of Gawker published his infamous piece on Silk Road on June 1st, 2011 “The Underground Website Where You Can Buy Any Drug Imaginable.” It would take another two years before Adam B. Levine of Let’s Talk Bitcoin and I would uncover that the Drug Enforcement Agency appeared to have infiltrated the Silk Road marketplace.Early in Bitcoin’s history it was possible to send bitcoin via IP address (e.g. 172.16.254.1) rather than public bitcoin address (e.g. 1BTCorgHwCg6u2YSAWKgS17qUad6kHmtQW). In November 2009 Satoshi reposted a request from a user to make Bitcoin anonymous and Satoshi discussed privacy and TOR in this regards:“When you send to a bitcoin address, you don’t connect to the recipient. You send the transaction to the network the same way you relay transactions. There’s no distinction between a transaction you originated and one you received from another node that you’re relaying in a broadcast. With a very small network though, someone might still figure it out by process of elimination. It’ll be better when the network is larger.If you send by IP, the recipient sees you because you connect to their IP. You could use TOR to mask that.You could use TOR if you don’t want anyone to know you’re even using Bitcoin.Bitcoin is still very new and has not been independently analyzed. If you’re serious about privacy, TOR is an advisable precaution.”Privacy is discussed in the original Bitcoin whitepaper (section 10) which mentions how Bitcoin keeps public keys “anonymous.” Satoshi likely used TOR when he announced Bitcoin, published the whitepaper and maintained his status as a Bitcoin developer because his identity is unknown which proves that someone who is skillful a genius probably could stay anonymous within Bitcoin.Bitcoin doesn’t have a gatekeeper. Fundamentally no one needs to ask permission to use Bitcoin or run a Bitcoin client making most financial blockades or sanctions at their core ineffectual. If and how Bitcoin will be used in “battle” is a dystopian future that remains to be seen. As the Navy notice observes, “Radical connectivity is blurring national lines and facilitating the transfer of virtual currency between otherwise disparate non-state actors.”Following are R3830 and R3861 their entirety:BAA for CTTSO/TSWG SupportSolicitation Number: N41756-14-Q-3272Agency: Department of the NavyOffice: Navy Engineering Logistics OfficeLocation: TSWGR3861 COUNTER THREAT FINANCEThis requirement is for innovative materiel and non-materiel solutions to develop and/or enhance new concepts and constructs for understanding the role of virtual currencies in threat finance. The world’s population grew by more than a billion people between 2010 and 2013, and by 2020, the number of Internet users is expected to double. Radical connectivity is blurring national lines and facilitating the transfer of virtual currency between otherwise disparate non-state actors. The introduction of virtual currency will likely shape threat finance by increasing the opaqueness, transactional velocity, and overall efficiencies of terrorist attacks. This requirement will explore the unique and required skills necessary to understand and react to the rapidly evolving architecture of threat finance networks within a radically connected hybrid warfare context and will develop solutions to combat vulnerabilities posed by virtual currencies.The proposed solutions should consider, but are not limited to, the following:• Identify relevant case studies from the last 20 years and explore how various funding instruments supported the flow of funds in support of threat finance networks. Determine the extent to which the nature, trajectory, velocity, and decision making supporting funds flows change with the introduction of virtual currencies into the systems.Determine the types of “red flags” that have emerged during the introduction of virtual currencies. Determine how these warning signs are being incorporated into future efforts to track ongoing funds flows supporting threat finance based business models. Determine how virtual currencies might alter threat finance models and whether it is possible to predict changes in its architecture.Determine how this information might be used to model and test the flow of funds using virtual currency for use both in predicting future attacks and in developing and deploying disruptive strategies to prevent them.Determine what capabilities can be used to implement effective countermeasures to identify and mitigate terrorist threats supported by new payment systems and how these capabilities can be enhanced or developed.Develop beta test protocols for testing virtual currency risks under a range of scenarios.R3830 METHODS AND MEANS TO SYSTEMATICALLY DISCERN AND DISPLAY“PRECURSORS OF INSTABILITY” IN THE DARK WEBU.S. national security organizations and commands lack the ability to discern, understand, monitor, and where possible, make mitigation decisions against adverse phenomena in the Dark Web, a region of the Internet where activities such as trafficking in drugs, weapons, humans, and chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological technologies in support of disruptive, nefarious actions goes undetected. Current methods and means for discerning instability inordinately emphasize detection well after disparate phenomena have catalyzed into crisis, therefore forcing policymakers and commanders to react rather than allowing for predictive and proactive measures.The objective of this requirement is the development of an automated capability to intuitively visualize geographic and functional areas of latent and/or emergent instability in the Dark Web. For the purposes of this requirement, the Dark Web includes sites that are not indexed by major search engines and which are accessed by using anonymizing software (e.g., onion domains). Discerning, then monitoring latent instability manifest inDark Web precursors would enable the development of more nuanced, contextually appropriate and proactive theater-strategic policy reflected in: 1) more efficient and effective strategic communications and military information support operations (MISO), 2) enhanced military-to-military engagements, and 3) with an emphasis on UNCLASSIFIED, “share-able” information/knowledge, the creation of “shared understanding” amongst partners and allies leading to combined mitigation actions.Lastly, and most critically, the emphasis on identifying precursors to allow detection well left of crisis on a timeline where 1) commander’s mitigation options are more numerous, 2) the risks of execution are relatively low, 3) coordinated interagency collaboration and action has the greatest probability of success, and 4) access to Dark Web information is relatively high (acknowledging that the Dark Web, by definition, is already obscured by security and technical systems and protocols).Proposed Specifications and Key Performance Parameters:Automated capabilities/specifications:Ability to crawl a prepopulated list of Dark Web sites and gather information.Ability to discover new sites in the Dark Web as they materialize (some level of latency is permissible, but this must be specified).Ability to automatically group/categorize observed potential threats/activities for analysis/visualization by geographic and/or functional area.Ability to visualize trends over time with respect to the groupings/categories referenced in the previous bullet in terms of their (1) frequency/commonness and (2) threat intensity in a fashion that is intuitively usable/interpretable by a military commander (i.e., an intelligent non-specialist).Manual capabilities/specifications:Ability to manually adjust/tweak sites crawled for information.Ability to manually adjust/tweak categorization algorithms.Ability to search crawled information for specific strings.Ability to output data (to include metadata resulting from in-program analysis—e.g., category names and measures of frequency/commonness and threat intensity) in file formats amenable to analysis in other tools (e.g., PNNL’s IN-SPIRE for thematic extraction, R for statistical analysis)Bitcoin Bomber Center Image Courtesy of Bitcoin not Bombs",

    "text": "Bitcoin has become a powerful tool for independent activist journalists. In the past, news writers and correspondents would compete for limited professional opportunities with large media networks. The message was highly centralized and filtered from the top.As technology has evolved, it has empowered mass coverage of anti-establishment opinions. The Internet has allowed anyone with a message to have a voice and Bitcoin has allowed anyone with a dream to fund it.As news coverage opportunities arise, indie media personalities can crowdfund an on-location trip with bitcoin and buy a plane ticket through CheapAir almost instantaneously. This removes the need for a large network to cover travel costs, which helps to create a de-centralized source for unfiltered news.Never before has documenting the realities of the world been so simple for the independent journalist.Meet Derrick Broze, a bitcoin powered independent activist journalist.I was introduced to Derrick at a Houston, Texas End the Fed rally. I was instantly captivated by his warm energy and profound life perspective, so I began to follow his social media channels.Over the years his activism became his journalism and he began to travel the country covering and creating unique media events. He was first introduced to bitcoin about two years ago, and began accepting the cryptocurrency as payment for his stories on The Liberty Beat.He typically spends his bitcoin on plane tickets to get to his next news story, but Derrick doesn’t only fly.

    "text": "Libertarian leader Jeffrey Tucker, CEO of Liberty.me and publisher of Laissez Faire Books, shared with Bitcoin Magazine his views on how Bitcoin is NOT a monetary system.Bitcoin Is Not a Monetary SystemBy Jeffrey TuckerEvery since I started writing about cryptocurrency last Spring, my inbox has become a hub for Bitcoin questions. I completely understand – even to me it’s still the most implausible idea ever that some code-slinging, nameless geek somewhere could somehow invent a new currency made from 1s and 0s, throw it out there on an open forum, and (in a mere five years), it would obtain a market capitalization worth nearly $10 billion.What does it all mean? Well, it took me some serious study to figure out how all the technologies hang together and why. Understanding Bitcoin requires knowledge of monetary theory, open-source programming, distributed networks, cryptography, and process-oriented software development — and that’s quite a big undertaking. This accounts for why people are so confused as to how a protocol could become the basis of a new global monetary order.However, I actually don’t think that a lack of technical knowledge really accounts for why even some very smart people are having a hard time making sense of the success of Bitcoin. A hint towards the answer came in an email from a correspondent who asked me a particular question about how contracts and accounting will work once Bitcoin “is implemented as a currency.”I got stuck on the word “implemented.” That’s the core of the fallacy; and, again, it is completely understandable. Hayek wrote in 1974 that governments have owned and managed monetary systems for many hundreds of years, even back to the ancient world: the coin of the realm has been seen as a government responsibility. In the 19th century, all governments were expected to implement a system that best met the needs of the population.In the 20th century, government took this idea much further. It would not just print the money, it would not just oversee the system and determine what constituted money, no – it would use ‘science’ to find the optimal money-creation rate and cartelize the banking system to make sure that it was exactly as it should be. Every aspect of the money system — and we are talking about half of every economic transaction — would be overseen by the state in conjunction with private partners in industry.And so it has been for all these years. No living person remembers a time when money had any existence outside public management. In effect, all governments of the world made money a socialistically owned good. And what happened? It became a tool of politics; it declined in quality, buying less and less in terms of goods and services; in effect, it became the main means of funding the expansion of power over liberty.The emergence of cryptocurrency smashes that paradigm entirely. “Satoshi Nakamoto” never asked for anyone’s permission to release his code-based model for the ideal currency, he didn’t submit a working paper to the National Bureau of Economic Research, he didn’t meet with Federal Reserve economists, testify to the Senate Banking Committee, or get the ear of the chairman of the Fed. He went straight to the public.He bypassed the entire structure of power and released it on a distributed network. He invited the world to participate. In other words, he was not proposing a system at all, it is not a top-down plan for monetary reform. We’ve seen scads of those — thousands upon thousands — emerge over the last hundred years. None of them have come to anything. You can talk about monetary rules, policy reforms, audits, and exchange rate fixes all you want, but here is the grim reality: government owns the money and it will use it to serve its ends.That’s why a totally different approach was necessary: the free market. The free market is not a system, it is not a policy dictated by anyone in particular, it is not something that Washington implements, it does not exist in any legislation, law, bill, regulation, or book. It is what you get when people act on their own, entirely without central direction, and with their own property, and within human associations of their own creation and in their own interest. It is the beauty that emerges in absence of control.Does that sound like anarchy? It struck Karl Marx that way. What he did not understand was the central insight of the liberal revolution of the 18th century: society can manage itself and create its own beautiful order without any central control. Bitcoin is a paradigmatic example, but only one of a million now emerging all over the world.Who or what is chronicling these revolutionary developments and plotting to push them further as a means of achieving greater freedom in our own lives, and therefore in society as a whole? Liberty.me. Our purpose is to invite everyone into a close engagement with the wonderful upheavals going on right now.",

    "title": "With the rise of Bitcoin and other potential cryptocurrencies that represent mobile money without borders, it may seem like this",
    "text": "With the rise of Bitcoin and other potential cryptocurrencies that represent mobile money without borders, it may seem like this is a completely new idea. While the technologies being used may be new, the idea of a World Currency has been around for awhile. Discussion of this at the IMF has gone on for years. An example would be this 2009 IMF blog article titled “Reserve Currencies in the Post-Crisis International Monetary System”. The article traces the history of the US dollar as a world reserve currency back to the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference. It then proceeds to discuss potential competitors to the US dollar. It briefly mentions the Euro and the Renminbi, but quickly dismisses them. It then moves on to a discussion of possibly using the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR’s) as a world reserve currency. However, the article notes that has drawbacks too. It then moves on to the more interesting concept of a new kind of global currency. Here is a quote from the article.“An even more ambitious solution would be to move to a truly global currency, along the lines of Keynes’s “bancor”, that would circulate alongside countries’ own currencies and would offer a store of value truly disconnected from economic conditions and policies in any country. To achieve this, one would need to set up a global monetary institution that would issue the global currency depending on global economic conditions, and that could act as a global lender of last resort. It would need to have an impeccable (“AAAA”) balance sheet, and governance arrangements that engender widespread credibility and acceptability.”If we stopped reading at the end of the bolded italics, we might conclude that sounds like Bitcoin or other similar cryptocurrencies. If we continue reading though, we see it is different. The global currency described here would need to set up a “global monetary institution that would issue the global currency”. This would be more like the GSD that Klickex is working on that we discussed in an earlier article in Bitcoin Magazine.There have been other articles in the past that talk about a global currency. But an article that appeared in a January 1988 issue of Economist Magazine is one I find truly incredible. If you think how different the world was in 1988, the precise predictions made in this article are quite amazing. The idea of a new “World Currency” of any kind was not in the mainstream of public thought.I have posted the full article here for anyone wanting to read it in its entirety. But let’s take a look at a few interesting quotes from the article and add some comments here and there (comments in bold type). Here is the opening paragraph. You might try inserting the SDR or the Klickex GSD where you see “phoenix”.\"THIRTY years from now (i.e. 2018), Americans, Japanese, Europeans, and people in many other rich countries, and some relatively poor ones will probably be paying for their shopping with the same currency. Prices will be quoted not in dollars, yen or D-marks but in, let's say, the phoenix. The phoenix will be favored by companies and shoppers because it will be more convenient than today's national currencies, which by then will seem a quaint cause of much disruption to economic life in the last twentieth century.”At this point we could be talking about Bitcoin or any new cryptocurrency out there today. Let’s continue as the article talks about what could lead to this “New World Currency”. “. . . not long after the next currency agreement is signed it will go the same way as the last one. It will collapse. Governments are far from ready to subordinate their domestic objectives to the goal of international stability. Several more big exchange-rate upsets, a few more stock market crashes and probably a slump or two will be needed before politicians are willing to face squarely up to that choice. This points to a muddled sequence of emergency followed by a patch-up followed by emergency, stretching out far beyond 2018 - except for two things. As time passes, the damage caused by currency instability is gradually going to mount; and the very trends that will make it mount are making the utopia of monetary union feasible.” Pretty good forecast I would say. We have seen a “muddled sequence of emergency, followed by a patch-up, followed by emergency” play out before our eyes.Next is a statement that will get the attention of the Bitcoin user. Remember, this was written in January 1988. “As telecommunications technology continues to advance, these transactions will be cheaper and faster still.”Here we might still be talking about Bitcoin. But then the article turns towards something different. Something more like the SDR mentioned above (or even the Klickex GSD we wrote about in the earlier article here).“The phoenix zone would impose tight constraints on national governments. There would be no such thing, for instance, as a national monetary policy. The world phoenix supply would be fixed by a new central bank, descended perhaps from the IMF.This means a big loss of economic sovereignty, but the trends that make the phoenix so appealing are taking that sovereignty away in any case. Even in a world of more-or-less floating exchange rates, individual governments have seen their policy independence checked by an unfriendly outside world.”Now we see that this new World Currency would come from a new Central Bank that would mean a loss of sovereignty for individual governments. Not like Bitcoin. The article continues:“Preparing the way for the phoenix will mean fewer pretended agreements on policy and more real ones. It will mean allowing and then actively promoting the private-sector use of an international money alongside existing national monies. That would let people vote with their wallets for the eventual move to full currency union. The phoenix would probably start as a cocktail of national currencies, just as the Special Drawing Right is today. In time, though, its value against national currencies would cease to matter, because people would choose it for its convenience and the stability of its purchasing power.”Bitcoin users reading this article might see a lot that looks like Bitcoin in “the Phoenix.\" However, the article actually talks about something more like the SDR. Maybe even something like the GSD (Global Stability Dollar) unveiled last year by Klickex. The difference being, the last two would be regulated by the banking system as the Economist article was clearly anticipating. Regardless, this 1988 article was obviously ahead of its time. It shows that a new kind of world currency is not a new topic of conversation. And the mention of 2018 looks eerily realistic as we watch things unfold today.",

    "text": "The world’s first ever Bitcoin job fair is set to launch in Silicon Valley on May 3, 2014, featuring numerous employers and sponsors, both eager to spread the word on the increasingly popular cryptocurrency.The event is scheduled from 1:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m. (PST) at 440 N. Wolfe Rd. in Sunnyvale, Calif., and will provide an opportunity for job seekers to enter one of the most progressive fields of technology in the twenty-first century.Employers will be given the chance to choose from a pool containing some of the world’s top talent in the digital currency community, looking to employ Bitcoin developers, altcoin creators and blockchain experts.Analysts describe Bitcoin as representing “…the voluntary and spontaneous organization of an economy. A fresh new kind of social contract based on cooperation, not force. We’re hoping to help foster this new digital economy.”Popular for its lack of regulation by large banks and significantly lower transaction fees, the fair is expected to draw thousands of interested spectators, employers, and job seekers alike.Some of the positions employers are looking to fill include:BitPay - hiring Software Engineers, Front-End Engineers, and Sales & Implementation Engineers.CryptoTrustPoint.com is seeking a CTO.HolyTransaction.com is looking to hire some Programmers and Developers.PrivateInternetAccess.com is hiring DevOps and Software Engineers.Counterparty.co wants to add a full-time programmer to its core team.Purse.io was accepted to the inaugural Plug And Play Bitcoin Accelerator and is looking to build their team.Kraken - looking for front-end developers, software developers, DevOps and support specialists.The world’s first ever Bitcoin job fair will also provide opportunities to interact with serial tech-entrepreneurs like Andreas Antonopoulos, whose expertise ranges from Bitcoin, to crypto-currencies, to information security and even robotics software development.Antonopoulos has founded three bitcoin businesses and launched several community open-source projects. He’s also a talented writer currently working on a bitcoin book designed for developers.Plug and Play Tech Center, a global accelerator that specializes in growing tech startups, will also be in attendance, along with Coinality, the field’s leading job/resume board.Coinality, which launched in Sept. 2013, provides opportunities for those seeking jobs that pay exclusively in digital currency. They’re currently serving more than 2,000 registered users and have received over 600 job submissions. They are also host to hundreds of resumes and have served over 1,800 job applications.The excitement surrounding the new digital currency is expected to flourish as the numbers grow of those interested in an alternative currency that’s “decentralized, convenient and transparent.”Forbes reports that, “Over the past year, they have transformed from black market currencies to viable alternatives for traditional investments and existing currencies.”What makes the currency particularly unique is its ability to function both as a currency and as an investment. Today there are an estimated two to three million Bitcoin users holding the currency as an investment.If you’re a job seeker, employer, or someone simply interested in the development of a currency not regulated by an overly inflated federal government, don’t miss the chance to be part of something truly revolutionary.If you’re interested in being a sponsor at the event, you can sign up for one of their great packages here.",

    "text": "Austin, Texas is weird and at the Texas Bitcoin Conference, Bitcoin got a little weird. People from all over the world converged in Austin this past week to join in on the latest in the cryptosphere. The Conference was held at Circuit of the Americas, a race track appropriate for the Bitcoin world’s fast-paced nature. Mike Snow, the event organizer, made sure the conference was big just like Texas and he did a job well done. Speakers included Ravi Iyengar, Jeffrey Tucker, Andreas Antonopoulos, Anthony Gallippi, Dan Larimer and so many more too awesome to name.The Conference was set with many firsts, the first bitcoin concert (bitcoincert), the first Lamborghini bought with bitcoins was at the conference and I took sight of the first bitcoin ATM in the United States located at HandleBar.The Conference was divided into different subjects with general discussions, a track focused on women and the three main tracks: the merchant track, technical track and meta track.MainstreetTopics in the general segment included everything from an Introduction to Bitcoin to Ethereum. This was great because there were a lot of new faces at the event, some of which were new to Bitcoin.One of my favorite presentations was done by James D’Angelo who compared the roller coaster of bitcoins’ volatility to his adventures in Africa; it was one of the more unique presentations. James has been all over the world working in different wildlife parks, but as he explained, what was different about Africa is that all the animals can kill you. James suggested that in the future we will look back to today as the fun times because bitcoin will be about as boring as a fiat currency.WomenThe Texas Bitcoin Conference set itself apart from the others by offering a focus on women in the field. Technology and finance are notoriously male dominated fields so when CryptoWomen took the stage they identified the need for women in Bitcoin. Since only 6 of the Bitcoin community is represented by women this track was much needed. Esther Tung led the panel with Catheryne Nicholson, Stephanie Murphy, Tatiana Moroz and Marni Melrose who each had unique viewpoints. I would like to see the women in Bitcoin topic at more events.MerchantOf course Charlie Lee and Anthony Gallippi were there representing the payment processing side of things, but there were others talking about the benefits of accepting bitcoin. Remittance payments played a part in the Latin America panel and others and how it would affect businesses like Western Union. The fact that people can send money instantaneously and then go to a Bitcoin ATM and convert that into cash is also going to be game changing since there are little to no fees.TechnicalOn the technical side of the event, some minds were blown. Maidsafe.net set a goal of changing the world through a decentralized internet platform that would eliminate data centers and servers. “Maidsafe is doing for data what bitcoin is doing for trade,” as Nick Lambert said. Maidsafe will make data more secure by sending only pieces of information to the network where only you have access.Other technical topics included the future of mining panel, Stephen Sprague’s talk on trusted computing and Kristov Atlas’s interesting discussion on how to have financial privacy with bitcoin.MetaAndreas Antonopoulos talked about currencies as a “cultural artifact” and why there will be millions of AltCoins. A currency’s value is not created at issuance anymore but by people giving it value and value can be given to anything as Andreas explained just as children in primary school give value in trading marbles or rubber bands. Andreas is not only incredibly knowledgeable about Bitcoin, he is also funny; I don’t want to steal his jokes so go watch his presentation and the others.Access to the presentations from the conference can be purchased for $50 at the following link: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/texasbitcoinconference",

    "title": "The Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, the oldest and largest Bitcoin advocacy organization in the country founded by Anthony Di Iorio",
    "text": "The Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, the oldest and largest Bitcoin advocacy organization in the country founded by Anthony Di Iorio in April 2013, has announced a host of new updates relating to the Bitcoin Expo, an upcoming event that will take place in Toronto from April 11 to 13. Although there already have been two smaller Bitcoin-related gatherings in Canada, with the Bitcoin Summit in Toronto last October and Coinfest in Vancouver in February, the Bitcoin Expo will be the first major event to have a large marketing effort and attract attendees and speakers from Canada, the United States, Europe and Asia. The event has been in the works for several months, and was officially announced in November 2013; now, the Bitcoin Alliance has released a new website for the Expo, including the full speaker list, sponsorship packages and tickets on sale.The Expo will take place in the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, the largest conference and meeting center in the country. The conference area will include at least four major rooms, including two speaking rooms each capable of seating 500 people, a smaller speaking room and a media room, and there will also be smaller rooms for events like fireside chats. The exact schedule has not yet been announced, but it is publicly known that the main event with presentations will take place on the Saturday and Sunday from April 12 to 13, with an optional gala dinner on Friday for whose who are willing to pay the extra $100 for a higher-level ticket. There will also be a free “Learn More About Bitcoin” event with 200 seats available on Saturday morning, as well as a hackathon dedicated to cryptocurrency technologies. The cost of the tickets is among the lowest for any Bitcoin event in the past year, with basic tickets at $200 (reducible to $180 if you take the simple step of becoming a free member of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada) compared to $300 for the Bitcoin Foundation’s official 2013 conference in San Jose, €350 for their upcoming 2014 event in Amsterdam, $200 to $250 for Miami and $500 for the Inside Bitcoins conference in New York. The Expo will also be non-profit, relying heavily on volunteers to set up the event and with all proceeds going directly to the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada.The speaker list now contains well over 40 speakers from a variety of walks of Bitcoin life; Bitcoin business owners and venture capitalists, members of the Canadian and US libertarian communities, non-profits, community organizers, a number of different “cryptocurrency 2.0″ projects (and other more humble altcoins), Bitcoin media outlets and developers are all represented. Some of the speakers include:Anthony Di Iorio, founder of the Toronto Bitcoin meetup, the Bitcoin coworking space and community center Bitcoin Decentral, Kryptokit and the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada. Coming from a long career in geothermal drilling technology and later real estate, Anthony first joined the Bitcoin community in late 2012, and immediately proceeded to found the first Toronto Bitcoin meetup in November 2012, making Toronto the third city in the country to have a meetup after Vancouver and Montreal. He is now employed in several Bitcoin projects full-time, including KryptoKit, Bitcoin Decentral, Ethereum and the Bitcoin Alliance.Andreas Antonopoulos, a well-known Bitcoin technology expert and public speaker at Bitcoin events. Andreas is also a regular participant in the podcast Let’s Talk Bitcoin, and has also recently taken up a position as the chief technology officer of blockchain.info.Charles Hoskinson, a Colorado-based mathematician and cryptographer who studied analytic number theory and worked on the Goldbach conjecture in graduate school before moving on to cryptography and later Bitcoin. Charles is most well known as the founder of the Bitcoin Education Project and creator of “Bitcoin, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Crypto”, a Udemy-based online course providing an introduction to Bitcoin and its internal workings.Cody Wilson, a Texan crypto-anarchist and founder and director of Defense Distributed, the organization that produced the first 3D printed gun. Cody has since become increasingly interested in Bitcoin, and is also a founding member of the Dark Wallet project.Joseph David, the founder of the Calgary-based exchange CAVirtex, the oldest still running Canadian Bitcoin exchange and the first to start trading Litecoin. CAVirtex is also developing a platform for merchant services and is increasingly moving towards becoming a large player in the Canadian Bitcoin merchant ecosystem.Jason King, founder of Sean’s Outpost, a homeless shelter feeding hundreds of people in Pensacola, Florida. Sean’s Outpost originally launched in 2012, but started accepting Bitcoin donations in March 2013 when the price of a Bitcoin first shot above $50. Jason made a post on Reddit asking anyone to donate a bitcoin and feed 40 homeless people at a cost of $1.25 per person. Four days later, Sean’s Outpost had raised over $600, and Sean’s Outpost has since become a regular presence in the Bitcoin community. More recently, Jason has also launched Satoshi Forest, a nine-acre “sanctuary for the homeless” in Pensacola, and he is now running across America to raise awareness for homelessness and Bitcoin.Jonathan Mohan, the founder of BitcoinNYC, a professional association of Bitcoin users in New York, and the founder of the New York Bitcoin meetup, which has now become one of the largest in the country.*Charlie Lee is the creator of Litecoin, the second largest cryptocurrency and one of the oldest that is still around today. Litecoin is most well-known for its use of the Scrypt mining algorithm, requiring a large amount of memory to compute in order to make it more difficult to produce specialized hardware for it. Charlie also works for Coinbase, one of the most popular ways to buy Bitcoin in the United States.Ron Gross is a co-founder of the Israeli Bitcoin community, one of the most concentrated Bitcoin communities in the world with several thousand members in its Facebook group out of a total population of 500,000 in Tel Aviv and 8 million in Israel. He is now also the executive director of the Mastercoin Foundation, and is a founding member of the Global Bitcoin Alliance.Tickets are available for sale on the Bitcoin Expo web site, and sponsorship packages ranging from $5000 to $35000 have also been posted. The Bitcoin community in Canada has been growing rapidly this past year, with burgeoning local communities in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver, each with a large meetup group, a dedicated community center and a Bitcoin ATM; the Bitcoin Expo is shaping up to be the grand opening of the Canadian Bitcoin community to the world at large. Looking forward to seeing you there!",

    "text": "Even though I was unable to find time to travel all the way to the U.S., I had the pleasure of watching Coinsummit’s live stream. Though the conference was focused on panels, there were a few company presentations. Only a couple really caught my attention in any meaningful way. One of these was Atlas ATS.Their new platform, Atlas 2.0, is a Financial Information Exchange (FIX) protocol digital asset exchange claiming to be the first to announce options on Bitcoin. The exchange platform is ‘Wall Street grade’, and, besides options, it brings a high level of sophistication: trading major alt-coins, an array of advanced native order types for FIX API clients, derivative products, multi-sig transaction wallet, and a larger selection of advanced order types for clients using the FIX interface.The Atlas 2.0 platform has been launched in Hong Kong and North America, where it has established the digital currency exchanges. The company is keen for the market to know that it has been deployed on a global, secure, and high precision private network. This network is exclusively managed under the Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), a division of Perseus Telecom.Perseus is a private global high precision network provider for financial trading, gaming, e-commerce and multi-media. Customers include top tier market makers, banks, exchanges and Fortune 500 companies.Perseus makes connecting to Atlas ATS simple, through a physical connection at any global location. Dr. Jock Percy, Chief Executive of Perseus, says they are “pleased to respond in tandem with Atlas ATS to the strong demand for diversified digital currency trading products accessible from any data centre in the world.”He goes on to add that “Both companies are truly able to translate real asset class risk, reliability and latency concerns and to utilize this expert knowledge for the digital currency trading ecosystem.”Shawn Sloves, Chief Executive at Atlas ATS notes that “Atlas ATS is pleased to expand (their) product offering to Options for our sophisticated global trading market participants.” He goes on to note that the company now offers “two types of option contracts, ‘Calls’ and ‘Puts’, which confer upon the owner the right to buy and sell, respectively, the underlying crypto-currency at a set ‘strike’ price on a given ‘expiration’ date.”The absence of options trading for cryptocurrency is often lamented. Let’s hope this company can live up to its promise and deliver a viable platform. It would benefit the ecosystem greatly.Atlas 2.0 supports three major alt-coins providing more products to trade and digital currency options for Bitcoin and Litecoin. Fees on options trades follow the maker/taker model. The rebate earned when adding liquidity is 0.1 and the fee for removing liquidity is 0.3.

    "text": "Bitcoin is often called “Gold 2.0” because they share many of the same traits. As we have magazines dedicated to “head to head” matchups in cars, motorcycles, computer parts, cell phones, etc. – perhaps we should have a head-to-head matchup between gold 1.0 and gold 2.0, Metal vs Digital. Money is commonly recognized to have six essential elements that make it ideal for transferring value between parties. These will be our criteria:DurabilityPortabilityDivisibilityFungibleLimited supplyAcceptabilityHistoryGold was used as a currency for 5,000 years. The US confiscated the citizens’ gold in 1933 then arbitrarily raised the recognized the set price by 40, thus giving the country 40 inflation overnight. They continued to redeem dollars of gold in foreign affairs. The US printed dollars to pay for World War 2, then the Cold War and the space race to the moon. But the world became increasingly worried about non-stop spending and by the mid 60’s there were open conversations between nations worried about the US’s ability to service its debts. The common mantra of the US was the “dollar was as good as gold” because those nations could convert one to the other at will. Eventually the leaders figured the better value was opted to take the gold instead.A speech given in 1965 by France president Charles De Gaulle speaking of America’s spending and debts sounds like it could have been given last week. He spoke of the “dollar crisis” as it allows the US to get into debt for free at the expense of other countries as the US insisted on paying in printed dollars. Nixon gave a speech in 1971 in an address to the US that announced the closing of the “gold window” that had been allowing countries to convert their paper dollar debts to gold. The US strategic supply was dwindling. This effectively took the US off the Gold Standard that had been holding printed dollars to any kind of discipline. Nixon’s speech to the world indicated that the move was temporary and that if the US continued to only buy American products, they wouldn’t feel a price difference. He insisted that the dollar would be worth just as much tomorrow as it was that day. He blamed the move on “International Speculators” betting against the dollar.DurabilityGold has proven itself to be one of the most durable substances on earth. It doesn’t degrade. Every ounce of gold ever mined is still around. (Excluding the small portion sent out of orbit) Gold has proven to be truly precious.Bitcoins can only be destroyed for a brief moment in their creation during mining under unusual circumstances which likely has not happened. But if the hard drive containing the private key is buried in a landfill, those units are forever gone. You could argue that a pirate treasure chest of gold buried on an island beach and long forgotten is the same end. The bitcoin units exist on the public ledger which is copied into the cloud and thousands of hard drives around the world. We can’t predict what may happen to bitcoin in a few hundred years but for today’s generation, so far so good. But because bitcoin is officially an experiment, we’ll have to give this one to gold.Winner: GoldPortabilityWhen talking about enough money to buy an average house or more, there is hardly a comparison to make. For the price of a $200,000 house you need about 12 pounds of gold. But then you have to have somebody verify that it isn’t fake with Tungsten metal core that has been uncomfortably common recently. Then you have to deal with security and insurance to move it. If you are moving even larger quantities, and across country borders, you also have to declare it, and pay all kinds of other fees and assessments in addition to even higher costs of security coordination between several entities. After you also include the cost of currency conversion (after all, how many people will accept gold directly as payment in full), all the friction may cost an additional 10 to 15. If that $200,000 house is in another country, you’ll need another 2 pounds of gold just to cover the overhead.Bitcoin, you can transport anywhere in the world with Internet access although companies like Bitgold are trying to change that. It travels at the speed of light. It really doesn’t need to move as it is in a public ledger. The only thing that moves is the location of the private key required to unlock them for spending. The key can be copied, written down, or memorized. It needs no third parties, insurance, or fees. It’s “frictionless”. You can transport it across borders without effort in something as simple as your memory. Paper wallets can be a string of numbers so small as to fit on a scrap piece of paper the size of a fortune cookie. Hundreds of thousands of places will accept bitcoin for payment without needing to convert it to cash. It can be done with your smartphone.Winner: BitcoinDivisibilityGold can be subdivided but at great cost and labor. Not just anybody can subdivide it into ounces, or half ounces, etc. You can subdivide it down to the gram which is 1/31 of an ounce in physical form. Currently $45 is your smallest physical unit so if somebody would take gold as payment, making change for a $20.00 movie ticket would be tricky at best. Technically gold is very divisible with scientific know how and expensive equipment, but practically it is not.Anybody can subdivide bitcoins as far as 8 magnitudes of order and can go deeper if needed. This is handled without effort by the computer system you are using. The charges happen automatically through the transactions. You can create any amount of free wallets to store your value into sub pennies of bitcoin to thousands of free wallets if you like. There is practically no limit.Winner: BitcoinFungibilityHaving one unit exactly like and worth the same of a second is important. Pulling a dollar out of your wallet is the exact same value as the second dollar pulled out of your wallet. Gold isn’t as simple. There can be dilutions of the metal. Coins can be struck at 90 gold, 100 gold or other variations. Weights and measurements can be off. Counterfeits using tungsten metal have occurred. There are price differences depending on the country or mint that issued the coin. Premiums are also found with the age and condition of the coins. The smaller that you break the gold down, the more expensive the portions get. 10 1/10th ounce gold coins cost significantly more than a single one ounce coin.Bitcoins have none of these problems. Each bitcoin has been recorded and cannot be counterfeited logically without billions of dollars invested into doing so for even a temporary benefit. It is practically impossible. One unit is always valued the same as the other sitting in the public ledger beside them. All of the pieces of a bitcoin add up 100 to the value of the whole.Winner: BitcoinLimited SupplyGold has a recognized limited supply. All the gold ever mined in history would fit in a cube block the size of a tennis court. It is getting even harder to find as the easy spots are thought to have been found. But there could in theory be a new big find which would depress the price.Bitcoin supply is strictly defined. At a year, likely long after our death, bitcoin will finally reach the end of its new issuance in 2140. That is “hard-coded” into the currency. The rate at which it will be spawned into the system is also predictable. We can write contracts based on the known amount that will be issued. There is no need for speculation forward contracts. It is in much more restrictive limited supply than gold.Winner: BitcoinAcceptabilityGold is accepted for payment in gold stores for swapping for other precious metals. For realistic commerce very few places around the world accept gold for payment as the hassles of verifying it are real, and the security required to maintain it and handle the aspects make it not worth the hassle. The smallest unit sold is a gram for around $45-60 dollars. You can’t make gold change for less than that. If your purchases don’t come in multiples of 50’s you might be out of luck getting change.Bitcoin is accepted in thousands, if not millions, of locations already. There are exchanges all around the world and some with direct linking into your regular banks. The trend is for more companies to get on the bitcoin bandwagon as the technology and sophistication is allowing new generation’s access. Confidence in its value remaining steady or expectations of ever raising price values also increases its acceptance. As main street and Wall Street investors begin to invest large amounts of money into the system the network effect will allow it to get more attention of more merchants, which will have a domino effect for those that do not take it will suddenly be forced to accept it in ways all merchants eventually gave way to taking credit cards; if they didn’t they lost business. There is no movement to return our currency back to the 18th century. Outside the gold-bug crowd, gold as money is as foreign sounding to the new and upcoming generations as doing commerce with rocks.Winner: BitcoinWith a score of five to one, the clear winner is bitcoin. Gold bugs like Peter Schiff and Doug Casey might burst a vein in their head for you to say it, but their world of degrading bitcoin to prop up their business models will not last much longer as the tide turns. With more luck, we can finally pull all the gold stored underground in vaults back up above ground and melt it back into art and jewelry to be admired by all humanity.",

    "text": "It seems that there may be too much focus on the price of bitcoin as its only attribute. Many have indicated on various forums that one would have to pry their bitcoin from their cold dead virtual fingers or something to that effect. They hold deeply held expectations that their precious invisible currency will reach prices measured in six figures one day. Does having tens of thousands of misers help their cause? When bitcoin was owned by less than 100 people, would this ever work? Could it be valuable if only 1,000 people in the world owned any? What about 100,000 or only one million? For all the promises about the abilities of bitcoin, the dichotomy is it will only become more valuable if you spend it and spread the wealth and ownership. You can’t have your cake and eat it too. However, unique to the cause of bitcoin this might be somewhat possible, at least for a while, if you buy more as soon as you’ve spent it.One of the biggest knocks on bitcoin is the transaction volume. A glance at the transaction volume report on the website blockchain.info shows the average rate of transactions is decreasing. Other than a few temporary spikes, the volume has actually gone down over the last two years despite a huge increase in wallets and presumably the number of people owning bitcoin. Bitstamp and Coinbase are signing up new merchants at record pace, yet transaction volume stays the same? What’s in your wallet?The bitcoin network is currently throttled at about seven transactions per second. That’s 420 per minute, about 25,000 per hour and over 600,000 transactions possible per day. Today’s volume is about 15 of the peak. The artificial throttle in the bitcoin code is pegged at seven transactions to limit the blockchain size, but could be made much higher if there were demand. Visa’s typical transaction volume does this every few seconds. Many of these transactions in bitcoin are simply balance transfers from one to another without actually changing ownership as opposed to Visa which likely does relatively little volume of balance transfers. If only a small portion is actually passing through merchants, why should merchants be compelled to sign up when they see little demand?Many Bitcoiners believe that eventually, the technology will be the obvious preferred payment mechanism for most merchants because of the intrinsic protection against identity fraud. Perhaps the IT security folks at Home Depot will be embarrassed enough to reconsider. They lost control of the ID protection of 56 million customer accounts since April. Will this finally motivate them to find another solution? For the record, this author predicted and warned of these events in an article for Bitcoin Magazine about the same time this Home Depot hack attack was reported to have begun. In addition, more articles were written regarding this problem in March and January as well. Anybody still running Windows XP anywhere on their network after April 8, 2014, which was Microsoft’s cut-off date for Windows XP support. Unpatched and unsupported, XP in now the Swiss Cheese of operating systems and hackers are actively exploring every one of them. A unsupported Windows XP machine sitting on a network? You might as well put out the welcome mat.And yet, thousands of merchants are likely having their networks raided today for even more credit card hacking that you might not learn of for several more months unless you see it on your own bank records first. It is known that many companies now buy back their own secrets on the black market to keep it quiet. How often are banks going to reissue credit cards during the next several months before they start to wonder if there might be a better way? Albert Einstein was credited for describing insanity as “doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.”What merchants need is the good old fashioned “carrot and a stick” approach. They have the stick of punishment continuing to hit their backside from hackers. This makes CEO meetings with investors uncomfortable, while the CEO still has a job that is. We said goodbye to Target’s previous CEO Gregg Steinhafel after the Target hack attack. Will Supervalu's CEO Sam Duncan claim his $500,000 bonus when he walks out the door? Will Cerberus Capital Management, the huge multinational conglomerate owners of the effected Albertson's grocery store chain allow it? It probably will be no surprise to learn Home Depot CEO Frank Blake “coincidently” picked a good time to bolt for the back door about the same time they discovered their own compromised credit card security. Have the constant reports of major hacking theft rings become so commonplace it has become white noise for the public? Should one expect to see replacement credit cards in the mail each month? Each time they resend credit cards they are simply plugging the leaking dike with more fingers, yet the dam continues to crumble before them.Bitcoiners, what they need is a carrot; also known as the rewards. You own the carrot. Lead them to the promised land of bitcoin. When they see transaction volume rising, it will give them faith in the network. The public and CEOs of most big retailers will only believe what they can see – and they will see the power in the form of transaction volume. Those Bitcoiners sitting greedily on their bitcoins are only strangling the life out what could be thought of as a golden goose. The community will have to actually spend their bitcoin so that the currency flywheel can get spinning. Once it is spent, if you don’t have a big nest egg - just buy more bitcoin, right then. This action greases the wheels in the payment network by letting bitcoin run through your wallets and on to the merchants which will then sell it back to the payment processors where you buy it again. Replace what you’ve just spent and yes you’ve paid a small fee for your trouble (unless the retailer has given you a discount for your trouble). If we all do a little the cumulative effect will do a lot. Rinse and repeat. Support bitcoin businesses every chance you get if you want your net holdings to increase in value. For those Bitcoiners sitting on large stockpiles, consider that you will eventually need to spread that wealth so it can become popular. The math on 7 billion people owning 21 million bitcoin shows equal distribution to be .003 bitcoin each.The value of bitcoin is going to be derived from its use as a payment network first. It will have to gain legitimacy here as a tool. Its inherent value must be recognized and utilized. Only when the system is flooded with transactions and needs more bandwidth will the speculation phase of bitcoin’s value end. Its utility value will then be recognized. That’s where amazing things will begin to happen. Look to Overstock.com before Amazon. Give businesses accepting bitcoin your business as a first priority. If we all do a little, we can get the needle moving for the transaction volume on the blockchain.info chart. Make the bitcoin pioneers in retail proud to be the trailblazers.If you need a refresher course on why you are actually HURTING BITCOIN by not spending them, it may be a good time to refresh the lesson of Aesop’s fable, “The Goose that Laid the Golden Egg”. In this story, a lazy man living on a farm several hundred years ago inherited much land. Rather than working, he sold off pieces of land to pay for his lifestyle of temporary trivial riches until one day he found he had no property or items left to sell. One of the only items remaining was his pet goose. Before he took it to slaughter he found one morning that it had laid an egg made of pure gold. He quickly sold the egg to buy food and clothing to take care of his immediate needs. But the next day he found another golden egg which he used to buy a carriage and horses. The next day yet again another golden egg provided him wealth for a newer fancier home. This went on for some time before the man became greedy. He wanted all the eggs possible without waiting. He cut open the goose but found nothing. He never received another golden egg. His own greed ruined the ability for him to sustain his life. And soon enough his laziness and spending returned him to poverty.This life lesson is included with an entire collection of important life-lessons in Aesop’s fables including the “Boy Who Cried Wolf” and the “Tortoise and the Hare”. In an effort to show you’ve learned the lessons of the Goose and the Golden Egg, consider spending some bitcoin to order the entire collection of the classic Aesop’s Fables in hardback book form. One place to exercise this option is from Overstock.com and the order page for the book is found here.Then buy more bitcoin.Author’s note: The author is not endorsing the purchase of any product from any retailer specifically. The recommendation is to utilize the bitcoin market and the practice of using the payment network in general. Aesop’s Fables book will likely be found for sale at several bitcoin accepting merchants. Overstock.com was illustrated for example only.",

    "title": "Up until this point the problem of incentivizing productive activity has essentially been dominated by two major categories of solutions:",
    "text": "Up until this point the problem of incentivizing productive activity has essentially been dominated by two major categories of solutions: markets and institutions. Markets, in their pure form, are fully decentralized, made up of a near-infinite number of agents all engaging with each other in one-on-one interactions each of which leave both participants better off than they were before. Institutions, on the other hand, are inherently top-down; an institution has some governance structure that determines what the most useful activities are at any given time, and assigns a reward for people to do them. An institution's centralization allows it to incentivize production of public goods that benefit thousands or even millions of people, even if the benefit to each person is extremely small; on the other hand, as we all know, centralization has risks of its own. And for the last ten thousand years, these two options were was essentially all that we had. With the rise of Bitcoin and its derivatives, however, that may all be about to change, and we may in fact now be seeing the dawn of a third form of incentivization: currencies.In the standard account, a currency has three fundamental functions to society. It serves as a medium of exchange, allowing people to buy and sell goods for currency rather than having to find someone who simultaneously has exactly what you want and wants exactly what you have and barter with them, as a store of value, allowing people to produce and consume at different times, and as a medium of account, or a measuring stick which people can use to measure a constant \"quantity of production\". What many people do not realize, however, is that there is also a fourth role that currencies play, and one whose significance has been hidden throughout most of history: seigniorage.Seigniorage can be formally defined as the difference between the market value of a currency and its intrinsic value - that is, the value that the currency would have if no one used it as currency. For ancient currencies like grain, the seigniorage was essentially zero; however, as economies and currencies got more and more complex, this \"phantom value\" generated by money seemingly out of nowhere would grow bigger and bigger, eventually reaching the point where, in the case of modern currencies like the dollar and the bitcoin, the seignorage represents the entire value of the currency.But where does the seigniorage go? In the case of currencies based on natural resources, like gold, much of the value is simply lost. Every single gram of gold comes into existence through a miner producing it; at first, some miners do earn a profit, but in an efficient market all of the easy opportunities rapidly get taken up and the cost of production approaches the return. There are of course clever ways that seignorage can still be extracted from gold; in ancient societies, for example, kings would mint gold coins which would be worth more than ordinary gold because the coins contain an implicit promise from the king that they are not fake. In general, however, the value would not go to anyone in particular. In the case of the US dollar, we saw a slight improvement: some of the seignorage would go to the US government. This was in many ways a large step forward, but in other ways it is also a revolution incomplete - currency, having gained the benefits of centralized seignorage, also gained its risks by embedding itself into the heart of one of the largest centralized institutions in human history.Bitcoin Came AlongFive years ago, a new kind of money, Bitcoin, came along. In the case of Bitcoin, just like the dollar, the currency's value is 100 seigniorage; a bitcoin has no intrinsic value. But where does the seignorage go? The answer is, some goes into the hands of the miners as profit, and the rest goes to fund the miners' expenses - the expenses of securing the Bitcoin network. Thus, in this case, we have a currency whose seignorage goes directly into funding a public good, namely the security of the Bitcoin network itself. The importance of this is massively understated; here, we have an incentivization process that is simultaneously decentralized, requiring no authority or control, and produces a public good, all out of the ethereal \"phantom value\" that is somehow produced from people using Bitcoin between each other as a medium of exchange and store of value.From there, we saw the emergence of Primecoin, the first currency that attempted to use its seigniorage for a purpose that is useful outside of itself: rather than having miners compute ultimately useless SHA256 hashes, Primecoin requires miners to find Cunningham chains of prime numbers, both supporting a very narrow category of scientific computation and providing an incentive for computer manufacturers to figure out how to better optimize circuits for arithmetic computations. And its value rapidly rose and the currency still remains the eleventh most popular today - even though its main practical benefit for each individual user, the 60-second block time, is shared by many other currencies far more obscure than it.A few months later, in December, we saw the rise of a currency that is even more eccentric and surprising in its success: Dogecoin. Dogecoin, currency symbol DOGE, is a currency which, on a technical level, is almost completely identical to Litecoin; the only difference is that the maximum supply will be 100 billion instead of 84 million. But even still, the currency hit a peak market cap over over $14 million, making it the sixth largest in the world, and was even mentioned on Business Insider and Vice. So what is so special about DOGE? Essentially, the internet meme. \"Doge\", a slang term for \"dog\" that first appeared in Homestar Runner's puppet show in 2005, has since caught on as a worldwide phenomenon with the accompanying practice of putting phrases such as \"wow\", \"so style\" and \"such awesome\" in colorful Comic Sans font with the background of a Shiba Inu dog. This meme represents the entirety of Dogecoin's branding; all of its community websites and forums, including the official Dogecoin website, the obligatory Bitcointalk launch thread and the r/dogecoin and r/dogecoinmarkets subreddits are all splattered with Doge iconography. And that's all it took to get a Litecoin clone to 14 million dollars.Finally, a third example comes from outside the cryptocurrency space in the form of Ven), a more traditional centralized currency which is backed by a basket of goods including commodities, currencies and futures. Recently, Ven added carbon futures to its basket, making Ven the first currency that is in some fashion \"linked to the environment\". The reason this was done is a clever economic hack: the carbon futures are actually included in Ven negatively, so the value of the currency goes up as society moves away from high-CO2 methods of production and CO2 emissions permits become less lucrative. Thus, each individual Ven holder is now, albeit slightly, economically incentivized to support environmentally friendly living, and people are interested in Ven at least partially because of this feature.On the whole, what these example show is that alternative currencies are pretty much entirely dependent on grassroots marketing in order to achieve adoption; nobody takes Bitcoin or Primecoin or Dogecoin or Ven by people need to go door to door and convince merchants to accept them, and it is not just the technical superiority of a currency that determines its traction - ideals matter just as much. It was Bitcoin's ideals that convinced Wordpress, Mega and now Overstock accept Bitcoin, and it is arguably for the same reason that Ripple as a payment method, despite its technical superiority to Bitcoin for merchants (specifically, five-second confirmation times), has so far failed to gain much traction - its nature as a semi-centralized protocol backed by a corporation that issued 100 of the currency supply for itself makes it unattractive to many cryptocurrency enthusiasts who are interested in fairness and decentralization. And now, it is the ideals of Primecoin and Dogecoin - those of supporting science and supporting fun, respectively, that keep both of those currencies alive.Cryptocoins as Economic DemocracyThese four examples, together with this idea of phantom seigniorage value, form what is potentially a blueprint for a new kind of \"economic democracy\": it is possible to set up currencies whose seignorage, or issuance, goes to support certain causes, and people can vote for those causes by accepting certain currencies at their businesses. If one does not have a business one can participate in the marketing effort and lobby other businesses to accept the currency instead. Someone can create SocialCoin, the currency which gives 1000 units per month to every person in the world, and if enough people like the idea and start accepting it, the world now has a citizen's dividend program, with no centralized funding required. We can also create currencies to incentivize medical research, space exploration, and even art; in fact, there are artists, podcasts and musicians thinking about creating their own currencies for this exact purpose today.In the case of one particular public good, computational research, we can actually go even further and make the distribution process happen automatically. Computational research can be incentivized by a mechanism that has not yet seen any substantial applications in the real world, but has been theorized by Peercoin and Primecoin inventor Sunny King: \"proof of excellence\". The idea behind proof of excellence is that the size of one's stake in the currency's decentralized voting pool and one's reward is based not on the computational power that one has or the number of coins one already owns, but on one's ability to solve complex mathematical or algorithmic challenges whose solutions would benefit all of humanity. For example, if one wants to incentivize research in number theory, one can insert the RSA integer factoring challenges into the currency, and have the currency offer 50000 units, plus perhaps the ability to vote on valid blocks in the mining process, automatically to the first person to provide a solution to the problem. Theoretically, this can even become a standard component in any currency's issuance model.Of course, the idea behind using currencies in this way is not new; \"social currencies\" operating within local communities have existed for over a century. In recent decades, however, the social currencies movement has declined somewhat from its early 20-th century peak, primarily because social currencies simply failed to achieve anything more than a very local reach, and because they did not benefit from the efficiencies of the banking system that more established currencies like the US dollar could attract. With cryptocurrencies, however, these objections are suddenly removed - cryptocurrencies are inherently global, and benefit from an incredibly powerful digital banking system baked right into their source code. Thus, now may be the perfect time for the social currencies movement to not only make a powerful, technologically enabled, comeback, and perhpas even shoot far beyond their role in the 19th and 20th centuries to become a powerful, mainstream force in the world economy.So where will we go from here? Dogecoin has already shown the public how easy it is to create your own currency; indeed, very recently Bitcoin developer Matt Corrallo has created a site, coingen.io, whose sole purpose is to allow users to quickly create their own Bitcoin or Litecoin clones with some parameter tweaks. Even with the limited array of options that it curerntly has, the site has proven quite popular, with hundreds of coins created using the service despite the 0.05 BTC fee. Once Coingen allows users to add proof of excellence mining, an option for a portion of the issuance to go to a specific organization or fund, and more options for customized branding, we may well see thousands of cryptocurrencies being actively circulated around the internet. Will currencies fulfill their promise as a more decentralized, and democratic, way to pool together our money and support public projects and activities that help create the society we want to see? Maybe, maybe not. But with a new cryptocurrency being released almost every day, we are tantalizingly close to finding out.",

    "text": "Bitcoin now has multiple dedicated Bitcoin ATMs in London, allowing the public to buy and sell Bitcoin for cash. This makes London one of the leading cities for these machines globally.UK Bitcoin based startup SatoshiPoint has just announced the installation of three Robocoin ATMs that will be live from Friday, May 30th. To celebrate, they are throwing a Bitcoin bash. This official launch party will be on the same Friday at Old Street Tube location Nincomsoup, starting from 6pm.The Launch party will be in conjunction with Bitcoin POS XBTerminal, who is also crowdfunding investment through crowd funding platform BanktotheFuture.A second launch party will be held a little later, to celebrate the opening of Bristol’s first ATM location on the the 3rd of June. The arrival of these Robocoin machines represent SatoshiPoint’s first. The company plans to import further machines, with a focus on operating full size commercial grade machines that allow the general public to both buy and sell bitcoins for physical cash in seconds quickly and simply.Satoshi Point’s three machines will currently charge a flat 5 fee over the live bitcoin price on Bitstamp. The company has future plans to integrate with cointrader to allow for faster withdrawals.SatoshiPoint LocationsThe machines will be located at Old Street, Nincomsoup, located within Old St Tube station AKA Silicon roundabout. Also, Oxford Street Rathbone News, Rathbone Place, London W1T 1JS – Closest tube Tottenham Court Road. And, Bristol City Centre, SuperFoods 25-27 St Stephens Street, Bristol, BS1 1JX.These are second generation Robocoin machines that include a passport scanner (a UK first) as well as biometric palm reader and driving licence reader. These security features will not be implemented from day one but are in place to future proof the machines and make sure they comply with any future regulatory requirements.SatoshiPoint is a founding member of the UK Digital Currency Association. Managing director Jonathan James Harrison says:“SatoshiPoint wants to take Bitcoin mainstream in 2014 and believes that Bitcoin ATMs are essential in making this a reality. Bitcoin ATMs provide a familiar and consistent way for normal people to get hold of bitcoin fast, or sell it quickly for real world physical cash.”SatoshiPoint has been funded by its two director-shareholders Jonathan Harrison and Hassan Khoshtaghaza. The two plan to scale up quickly and roll out more machines nationwide in other major cities. Investors will soon have the opportunity to invest in Satoshipoint Ltd with either bitcoin or sterling in return for real shares in the company.The company has been through Bank to the Future’s business crowdfunding programand is looking to raise £150,000 to fund rapid expansion. Satoshipoint has already been approved by HMRC for the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) which allows private investors to offset money invested in Satoshipoint against their personal income tax or capital gains tax.Anyone interested in attending either of the free opening party events should RSVP the organisers here.They promise to be a lot of fun for all to mark this momentous occasion.",

    "text": "As recently discussed, SatoshiPoint recently launched their first 2 ATMs in London and the 1st ATM outside of London in the UK, located in Bristol. The launch party was graciously supplied by SatoshiPoint, drinks and food were freely available and of quite a quantity, needless to say, there were a few tipsy people by the end of the evening (myself included). Hassan KhoshtaghazaThe launch party was relatively small in comparison to bigger events and conferences held in London, numbering around 40-50 people at one time, this allowed it to be excellently open to conversations from everyone to everyone.Bitcoiners mingled with new and old bitcoiners and even individuals who only had a vague idea of what bitcoin is. The event was hosted by Superfoods, representatives, Directors and CEOs from a variety of some well known and some emerging bitcoin businesses were in attendance, Blockchain, XBTerminal, BitXLiquidity, Banktothefuture, IBWT, Multibit, and local Meetup organisers and others, all gathered together to celebrate the launch of the 1st ATM outside of London and the start of a beautiful future.Jonathan HarrisonThe ATM itself, a Robocoin machine, worked smoothly when I tested it, buying bitcoins and selling. Though sometimes there can be some delay as going through bitstamp currently requires some manual interaction and a waiting period from the bitstamp side.Halfway through the party, we all gathered to listen to the inspiring speeches that were given by Hassan Khoshtaghaza and Jonathan James Harrison (Jj), the Directors of SatoshiPoint, who were followed by Simon Dixon (Banktothefuture), then Aleksander Nowak (XBTerminal) and a last speech by Keonne Rodriguez (Blockchain).It was inspiring to learn how Hassan and Jonathan did not know each other before SatoshiPoint was dreamed of, how they met through twitter and saw in each other the same desire to bring ATMs to the shores of the UK. It reminded us all of another key factor of Bitcoin, how it has brought together individuals and how such a strong community has grown and continues to grow around it.The crowd applauded for each speaker, the general consensus that came from the speeches was that we are at the start of something amazing, something beautiful, and that we are all happy to be a part of that. Simon Dixon's SpeechDuring the speeches it was revealed that SatoshiPoint will be working with Banktofuture to allow potential investors to buy shares (not bitcoin shares) in SatoshiPoint and become a part of this emerging sector. Further information regarding this will be available once Banktothefuture have completed their redesign.Bitcoiners continued talking into the night, moving from one person to the other, networking and mingling with the beer flowing freely (though not everyone was drinking, some sensible people out there).Hassan discussed with me the next stages of growth for SatoshiPoint, and that there was some very interested people in getting a Bitcoin ATM in their location. Even at the launch party people were vying for Hassan and Jonathan to look to their city next (shouts of \"Cardiff!\" carrying over the crowd).And throughout discussions, technical or otherwise, it was generally agreed that whatever way the wind blows and what may be next within the Bitcoin sector, and even if Bitcoin succeeds or not it surely has woken up a lot of people to an alternative than the traditional system. Keonne RodriguezAnd let us not forget the food, it was excellent and very healthy, provided by Superfoods and their in-house chef (I do suggest trying out Superfoods if you are ever in Bristol), the general atmosphere was informal and a very friendly.The two ATMs located in London and this one located in Bristol is just the start, over the next years we can expect many more ATMs from SatoshiPoint to be branching out all across the UK. The infrastructure is still being built upon, and will be built upon for many years to come.As I discussed with Keonne, a lot still needs to be done to allow the average individual to be able to get Bitcoins easily, exchanges and other means often prove too time consuming or too technical (and time consuming to learn the technical side) for individuals who are interested. ATMs help bridge that gap with a simple \"put paper money in\" or \"get paper money out\" tactic, they (ATMs) are viewed as a key infrastructure point for the development of the Bitcoin sector.Hassan and Jonathan had this to say on the future development of Satoshipoint: We will be expanding across the UK, if you wish to get in touch with us and discuss getting a Bitcoin ATM in your location, please feel free to contact us through our contact page on SatashiPoint.co.uk, if you are interested in getting directly involved and having a stake in SatoshiPoint then visit banktofutures website once they have relaunched ~ JJ & Hassan. The Bristol SatoshiPoint ATM is located within the Superfoods store, 25-27 St Stephens Street, a 10-15 minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads (train station), located right in the center of Bristol.",

    "title": "Late Thursday evening when Gil Luria of Wedbush Securities and I announced on Twitter that Fortress Investment Group (NYSE: FIG)",
    "text": "Late Thursday evening when Gil Luria of Wedbush Securities and I announced on Twitter that Fortress Investment Group (NYSE: FIG) is probably the first public company to purchase and hold Bitcoin, there was an additional filing that same evening I made note to review. This filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission was the annual report (10K) for SVB Financial Group.SVB Financial Group offers “diversified financial services through Silicon Valley Bank, SVB Analytics, SVB Capital, SVB Global and SVB Private Bank, SVB Financial Group {which} provides clients with commercial, investment, international and private banking services. The company also offers funds management, broker-dealer transactions and asset management…Headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif., SVB Financial Group (Nasdaq: SIVB) operates through 27 offices in the U.S. and international operations in China, India, Israel and the United Kingdom.” SVB has $23 Billion in assets and over 1,600 employees (and this video shows that it can be a fun place to work).John Lee, VPSVB Accelerator Group was interviewed (YouTube) at the GigaOM Structure 2011 and said that they are working with 1,500 seed stage companies in the Bay area alone and the bank works with 10,000 clients across the country. According to a San Jose Mercury news article from 2011, SVB is a “behind-the-scenes player in the creation of more than 30,000 startups.”Under the section “We face risks in connection with our strategic undertakings and new business initiatives,” SVB disclosed that:“We are focused on our long-term growth and have undertaken various strategic activities and business initiatives, many of which involve activities that are new to us, or in some cases, experimental in nature….We are also expanding our payments capabilities to better serve our clients, including innovating new electronic payment processing solutions, developing new payments technologies, and exploring new evolving payments systems, such as virtual currencies known as ‘bitcoin.’”I’m a bit perplexed by the way this is written. SVB is no stranger to Bitcoin and therefore should know that there aren’t various currencies known as bitcoin. Perhaps the filing should have read as follows? “..exploring new evolving payments systems, such as the virtual currency known as ‘Bitcoin.’It has been well established that Bitcoin companies and entrepreneurs have difficulties obtaining bank accounts. However, SVB is one of the first U.S. Banks that has been willing to work with Bitcoin businesses…or is it?SVB appears to have a history of interest in companies engaging in alternative currency issuance. A SVB Showcase YouTube video fromOctober 2011has an SVB Accelerator interview with Bob Bagga, CEO,BizXchange. BizX is a “Social Commerce platform that uses our private and complimentary [sic] currency, the BizX $ to support and grow commerce in B2B, B2C and C2C; svb.com.”The bank does provide traditional forex services as detailed in its regulatory filing:“… These products and services include foreign exchange services that allow commercial clients to manage their foreign currency needs and risks through the purchase and sale of currencies, swaps and hedges on the global inter-bank market.”Moreover, In August 2011, SVB announced an Internet Payment System to help companies sell overseas by collecting “foreign payments of all major types or currencies.”However, Bitcorati.com, “a global directory and rating system for the people and businesses involved in Bitcoin”, tried to open a bank account with SVB last October and was declined for the following reasons:“We circled internally with our regulatory group and I’m afraid our concerns were correct. At this time SVB cannot initiate any new relationships or accounts for companies that receive BitCoin [sic] for any form of payment…”I guess when Greg Becker, President and CEO of Silicon Valley Bank said (YouTube) that ”We work with the coolest companies of any bank globally,” doesn’t necessarily include companies involved with everyone’s favorite cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.SVB’s caution isn’t without merit. If you carefully read SVB’s response to Bitcorati, they state that they will not initiate any new relationships or accounts and this implies that there are or were pre-existing relationships and indeed there are (and “were”).In “Bitcoin Exchange Deal Repatriates Assets To U.S.CoinLab” Jon Matonis explained in Forbes how CoinLab announced that it would be taking over Mt. Gox’s U.S. and Canadian based trading accounts and that it would “not have been possible without a solid and willing financial institution in the United States {ie. Silicon Valley Bank}”. Teri Buhl of Bitcoin Magazine noted the goal was to move customers’ money from overseas to Silicon Valley Bank. It was set up as a revenue sharing arrangement between CoinLab and Mt. Gox and CoinLab would in part use Mt. Gox’s pre-existing infrastructure. CoinLab detailed for its first 100 alpha customers that they would be “Withdrawing by wire from SVB (details will be on your account page).”Shortly thereafter the relationship between Mt. Gox and CoinLab collapsed and CoinLab filed a formal complaint in Federal Court against Mt. Gox seeking $75 million in damages.Coinlab CEO Peter Vessenes wrote a personal statement regarding the lawsuit and hinted that things might not be kosher at Mt. Gox:“…Bitcoiners have, on average, lost more money due to technology difficulties, frozen / lost banking relationships and shady characters like pirateat40 than due to any part of Bitcoin’s fundamental economics…”It is possible that during the due diligence stage between these companies accounting irregularities at Mt. Gox were first discovered (not necessarily by CoinLab nor SVB). CoinLab said that “We’re working a plan with Gox that may end up allowing them to hold the ‘hot wallet’ coins and leave cool and cold storage in our secure environment. We’ll know more soon.” Although not mentioned specifically in the lawsuit, I am guessing (i.e. conjecture on my part) that Mt. Gox’s inherent inability to transfer Bitcoin in cold storage to CoinLab and a proper accounting of Bitcoin sunk the deal.The lawsuit does mention that “{Mt. Gox} failed to timely reconcile revenue and customer trade imbalances…” and “…failed to timely deposit Liquidity Funds in the manner instructed by CoinLab” and “…”failed to deliver all passwords, Yubikeys, administrative logins and any other security information required so that CoinLab may assume operation of the Bitcoin exchange services for customers in the United States and Canada in case of a service interruption.”Back to SVB…To put SVB further into context for those unfamiliar with the bank, SVB CapitalsStrategic Investors Fund V-A, LP Third Quarter 2012 Report to Limited Partners(PDF) explains that one of SVB Capital’s biggest deals include Facebook’s $16 Billion Initial Public Offering in May with Accel Partners which according to “Who Owns Facebook” owns 10 of the company. Looking further into the document we find fund commitments from “Andreessen Horowitz Fund III, LP” and the “Andreessen Horowitz Parallel Fund.”In Marc Andreessen’s article for New York Times “Why Bitcoin Matters” received an editorial note that “Marc Andreessen’s venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has invested just under $50 million in Bitcoin-related start-ups. The firm is actively searching for more Bitcoin-based investment opportunities. He does not personally own more than a de minimis amount of Bitcoin.”ACH or “Automated Clearing House” services for Coinbase appear (odd to see this term/disclaimer used) to be provided by SVB. And it was announced in December that Coinbase Raised $25 Million From Andreessen Horowitz.For now it appears that one has to have access to high profile venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz if they want to pitch their their Bitcoin business to SVB. Perhaps a quarterly filing by SVB this year may shed more light on their Bitcoin experimentation.Last December, I noted in my blog a 10-Q filing by ITEX (OTCQB:ITEX), a bartering system/marketplace which facilitates cashless transactions, in which Itex warned in its quarterly report that “Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple may Cause it to Lose Revenue” and that “new focus on Virtual Currencies by regulators may have ‘spill over’ into Itex’s Business.” Last week ITEX went on to announce that it was the “First Trading Community to Accept Bitcoin.” If you can’t beat them, join them I guess. I’m not sure if this is also SVB’s mantra because the message was kind of cryptic.",

    "text": "Bitcoin exchanges are going through hard times. In the span of a month, Mt. Gox has gone bankrupt, Flexcoin has shut down due to robbery, and Vircurex has halted Bitcoin withdrawals.Coinex.pw was also hacked. At first glance, these events appear devastating for the Bitcoin economy. But when we look deeper, we discover something extraordinary.The following fact has the potential to fundamentally transform financial markets: Depositors are losing their money. This is great news, albeit not from the recent depositors’ perspective. From a broader economic standpoint, Bitcoin bank runs are radically changing the core of financial markets: the incentive structure.Nearly every country on the planet has both a central bank and government-backed deposit insurance. The Bitcoin economy has neither. Why is this important? Because these institutions create an unhealthy incentive structure – one that has been plaguing the financial world for nearly a century.To illustrate, think about your bank. Have you ever asked to see their balance sheet, to make sure they are solvent? Of course not – your deposit is guaranteed, even if the bank fails. So why would you care? The bank could burn all the money in its vaults or flush it all down the toilet. It makes no difference; deposits are insured by the government.This creates perverse incentives, as banks do not need to compete over responsibility, security, or solvency (nevermind the outright bailouts irresponsible banks receive). We should not be surprised, then, when these companies engage in wild speculation and risky lending. Depositors don’t feel the pain.It doesn’t work that way in the Bitcoin market.It turns out, if you leave your private keys with a third party, you’re running a risk. The keys might get lost, the accounts might get hacked, or some unscrupulous company might steal your deposit. Of course, if you think of Bitcoin as digital cash, this is not surprising. The same risk is run if you leave a suitcase full of money with another party.After all of these exchange failures, what’s the first thing on everybody’s mind when they deposit their Bitcoin on an exchange? Safety, of course. And entrepreneurs know it. This is key. Customers have an incentive to care about the safety of their coins, and entrepreneurs have an incentive to satisfy this demand. Huge profits await the individuals or companies which provide secure Bitcoin banking. And the race has already started.It seems like every week, new exchanges are popping up all over the globe. Tens of millions of dollars have been invested in young companies working to create secure Bitcoin wallets. Companies like Blockchain.info might already have a working solution – they don’t store your private keys at all. Exchanges are now voluntarily auditingthemselves, in an effort to prove their security to customers. Entrepreneurs are going out of their way to create financial security for your Bitcoin deposits. In the future, we may see the creation of private deposit insurance, with all the right incentives behind it. You don’t get that kind of innovation in Old World finance.As markets grow, it’s easy to get excited about entrepreneurial success, profits, and value-creation. But bankruptcy and losses are also exciting. We are watching resources being transferred in real-time from the less-productive to the more-productive. Few first-generation Bitcoin companies still exist, and that’s not a bad thing. New entrepreneurs are entering the market, and we can expect to see more creative solutions to our problems – coupled with more bankruptcies and displacement of old firms.Though sometimes painful, the Bitcoin world is building a brand new financial system, and it’s grounded with the right incentives. With this perspective, it is hard not to get excited about the future challenges Bitcoin faces.",

    "text": "Some people say money is the root of all evil. Others say its a necessary evil. Most can agree that it’s an important human innovation.But it hasn’t been widely acknowledged that the human desire for money can actually be used to peer into the future.A Prediction Market (PM) is a place where people can bet on the outcome of an event. If they guess correctly, they win money. If they guess incorrectly, they lose money.People care about their money, so the market price of an event gives us a good answer to the question “Will this outcome happen or not?”It’s not magic. It’s the economics version of the “wisdom of the crowd”.Intrade became the first provider of this form of market online. It was closed down last year.Paul Sztorc has begun to develop Truthcoin, a prediction market based on the blockchain.Part 1 of Paul’s 5 part introduction to prediction markets highlights some of the problems of traditional Prediction Markets:“There are several problems with PM’s: mainly the fact that when persuading others of something complex, [people tend] to highlight true statements when they support their own argument, and hide them away when they support an alternative argument.[Also], If you make a bet with someone, you have to trust them to pay up. Tradable-Predictions, defined as “assets with a definite future value based solely on their future accuracy” have never existed. Instead, the value of PM-Predictions depended substantially on the behavior of the counterparty (ie, the guy holding the money). You can’t “own” a prediction, only a paper claim to money held by the PM administrator. The PM administrator has proven to be unambitious at best (accepting only a few bet-topics) and unreliable at worst (losing funds and/or going out of business, see Appendix). PM-admins rely on trust (as they hold their customer’s money) yet are prevented from accessing trust-forming institutions (law-enforcement, brands/advertising) because of their regulatory/legal/awareness challenges.”He goes on to say:“Bitcoin operates independently of a nation’s legal framework, and might avoid closure or regulatory interference. If so, competing “Bitcoin InTrades” would appear to fulfill market demand. Unfortunately, PMs require a way to store up money and pay it out based on a real world outcome, which implies trusting a third-party with your money. Use of supra-national Bitcoin would prevent the use of any legal guarantee (to justify this trust).”Bitcoin demonstrates that a blockchain can provide scalable, censorship-resistant, and trustless solutions to value-transfer problems. Blockchain solutions also generate efficiency by cutting out middlemen and avoiding overhead costs (no brick-and-mortar, compliance, administration, etc.). They are egalitarian and immortal. “Paul expanded on these ideas and told me a little more about himself by answering these questions I had for him.What is Truthcoin?A marketplace for the creation and trading of ‘event derivatives’, which have a final value based only on the-state-of-the-world (such as election results or stock prices) and nothing else.Truthcoin’s markets might resemble “smart contracts”, where the focus is not on “performing the math calculation of the contract”, but instead on “getting accurate reports from people”. Where a user would ask Ethereum to solve an equation using some algorithm, a user might ask Truthcoin to honestly-uncover “what was the solution to that equation” from users. Although users would be free to lie about what that solution was, an incentive mechanism discourages this. The emphasis is on “the solution itself”, not on “the process of solving”.How was it formed?InTrade.com was possibly my favorite website on the internet, but, tragically, it was forced to close for a variety of reasons. I felt that the closure of InTrade resembled the closure of Liberty Dollar and e-gold. Just as the latter inspired Bitcoin, the former inspired me to try to do something similar for Prediction Markets. I thought about it for a while, and wrote down some code and a whitepaper at the beginning of this year.What is your professional background?I double-majored in Economics and Psychology (undergrad) and then dual-degreed (graduate) in Operations and Finance at CWRU. I’ve worked at Interactive Brokers and GE/NBC in technical/programming roles, worked on Six Sigma operations consulting, and Healthcare IT consulting. I currently work as a ‘Statistician’ or ‘Visiting Scholar’ doing grant-supported research (unrelated to Truthcoin) at the Yale Department of Economics.What are you currently busy with?Currently, a few people want to raise money for Truthcoin, or work as volunteers. Figuring out who is a good fit, exactly what I can reasonably promise to investors, what I should do with people who have already put in work, who I can trust to do a good job, and how to reward all of those people, are questions that consume my time. I also have a communication problem where most people (despite the whitepaper and code) don’t “get” the project. Right now I would like to make more demos, slides, infographics or videos.What is your vision for Truthcoin?The short term dream would be that people who know C++ Bitcoin very well would find Truthcoin, decide how to combine the pieces (the existing Bitcoin code + the new parts which I’ve coded), and help me release and maintain a version for discussion.The medium term dream would be widespread discussion of the costs and benefits of the core idea. Can the risks be mitigated (with sidechains/treechains, some kind of firewall, a multi-round test process)? Are the benefits substantial? Ideally, this would lead to the question: do enough people feel that it is sufficiently-valuable to actually switch from Bitcoin to this (or transform Bitcoin into this)? Currently, few have discovered Truthcoin at all, so such an ambitious question can’t even be asked.The long term dream is nothing short of a second Scientific Revolution restoring the virtue of empiricism to the public discourse. A world with optimally-accurate forecasts (“Will X be a problem in the future?”), optimal advice (“Which of X would produce more Y?”), stable-value cryptoassets (“BitUSD”), a world where CEOs and politicians have to work competitively for a living, where organizations of all kinds are unable to lie to the public, where smart contracts are widely available, where Public Goods can be financed quickly and at low cost, and where anyone with an internet connection has access to the combined intellectual powers of all mankind.Check out these Truthcoin resources below.Forum: forum.truthcoin.infoDocuments / FAQ: https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin/tree/master/docsOutcome-Resolution Demo: http://forum.truthcoin.info/index.php/topic,134.0.html",

    "text": "ATLANTA, GA – OCTOBER 1, 2014 — Georgia Institute of Technology will be the first university in the world to integrate bitcoin payments into its stadium concession sales and student dining and shopping credit system, announced Wednesday by BitPay, the world’s leading bitcoin payment processor.Bitcoin point of sale devices will be located in the student section of Bobby Dodd Stadium, and the Barnes & Noble store in Tech Square will be home to a bitcoin-enabled point purchase terminal for student credit BuzzCards. Students who use bitcoin will now be able to purchase food and goods at almost all locations on the Tech campus.Georgia Tech was founded in 1885 and remains one of the most prestigious public universities in the United States. The university has contributed a great deal of research as well as many notable graduates to the field of applied technology over the years. It continues to engage itself with technological progress through its leading role in university adoption of bitcoin through an innovative deal brokered by IMG, the university’s multimedia rights partner.As the “key to campus life” on Georgia Tech, the BuzzCard will be an important interface for student bitcoin use. Yellow Jackets fans will also be able to easily and quickly purchase snacks and drinks at Bobby Dodd Stadium with the world’s fastest payment method. These new bitcoin venues, along with bitcoin wallet provider Pheeva’s announcement of a unique “Jacketwallet” for Georgia Tech, hold promise for the role which digital currency may come to play in student life.“We look forward to working with BitPay to make bitcoin a viable payment option for our students and fans,” Georgia Tech AD Mike Bobinski said. “At Georgia Tech, we are always looking to lead in innovative ways, and this partnership with BitPay gives us an opportunity to do so by integrating this new technology at a sports venue and in the daily lives of our students.“Georgia Tech is one of the best sources of innovation in the country,” said Tony Gallippi, BitPay Executive Chairman and Georgia Tech alumnus. “BitPay is proud to offer its own innovative bitcoin payment processing to the university and its students.”In July, BitPay announced a breakthrough partnership with the Georgia Tech Athletic Association. The sponsorship is designed to build awareness to bitcoin by displaying BitPay’s logo along with the bitcoin symbol in Bobby Dodd Stadium and the McCamish Pavilion through the 2014-2015 school year.About BitPayBitPay is the global leader in bitcoin payment acceptance with offices throughout North America, Europe, and South America. The company has raised over $32 million from top investors including Index Ventures, Founders Fund, and Sir Richard Branson.About Georgia TechThe Georgia Institute of Technology, also known as Georgia Tech, is one of the nation’s leading research universities, providing a focused, technologically based education to more than 21,500 undergraduate and graduate students. Georgia Tech has many nationally recognized programs, all top-ranked by peers and publications alike, and is ranked in the nation’s top 10 public universities by U.S. News and World Report. As a leading technological university, Georgia Tech has more than 100 centers focused on interdisciplinary research that consistently contribute vital research and innovation to American government, industry, and business.",

    "title": "New York, NY (PRWEB) October 21, 2014Today, New York City-based recording studio, announced that it is changing the music industry",
    "text": "New York, NY (PRWEB) October 21, 2014Today, New York City-based recording studio, announced that it is changing the music industry by offering the first in-studio music seminars, and by announcing its acceptance of the controversial digital currency ‘bitcoin.’ Premier Studios serves the industry elite, is aimed at working with students, or others interested in pursuing a career in music production.In another pioneering move, Premier Studios announced the launch of their much-anticipated, intensive preparatory seminars. Individual ones range from $200-$400 and are being accepted now. If you accumulate approximately 15 seminars at a total cost of $5,000 (seminars are paid for when they are taken so you do not have to pay the $5,000 in 1 lump sum) you will receive a Certificate, which states you have completed the Premier Studios Session Seminars Program. Within 30 days, you will considered to be an intern at Premier Studios, and 30 days later, an assistant engineer. These impactful sessions are focused on preparing students for work in studios and are led by famous music engineers and producers.Until the recent development and unveiling of music production courses were only offered at the university level. These courses are highly priced, ranging from $20,000 to $200,000 and are highly theoretical, making it difficult both for students to become producers and engineers and for graduates to succeed in a practical work environment. Premier Studio owner, Sandy Schneiderman, estimates that he refuses to hire “up to 90 of interns” due to their lack of preparation for a true studio work atmosphere. Seminars are intensive, practical seminars with a focus on real world applications. They are divided into two categories: basic and advanced, and include topics like ”Real Studio Environment”, “Balancing Mixes Using Dynamics and Placements, Songwriting and Production” and Master Music Production Techniques. Applications for the first Session Seminars are being accepted now.Understanding the importance of embracing change, Premier Studios is proud to announce its status as the first major music recording studio to accept the digital currency ‘bitcoin’ for its services. Now, superstars like Rihanna, Coldplay and Nas – who is famous for supporting bitcoin – can pay their way using the digital money. The suggestion came from Tatiana Moroz of Tatiana Coin and formerly the business manager at Premier, who had much success using Bitcoin to fundraise. The decision to use Bitcoin through Bitpay came quickly to the studio’s owner, who said it took him ‘60 seconds to decide’ on.About Premier Studios NYPremier Studio is a world-class facility, serving the elite of music, film & television celebrity clientele and is formally known as Quad Recording. Premier Studios NY recently completed a $500,000 USD refurbishment of all their studios. The studio contains four fully-loaded rooms to accommodate writers, producers and performers and is located on the 6th and 8th floors at 723 7th Avenue in New York, New York.

    "text": "Darkwallet instructionalTranscription:Hi I’m Amanda Johnson, a writer at Bitcoin Magazine and I’m here to show you how to install and use the features of the Dark Wallet.It is currently in it’s 6th version of alpha testing and this means it is known to be unstable. You can use the wallet with testnet Bitcoins or real Bitcoin.Go to darkwallet.is. The Dark Wallet runs in Chrome and Firefox browsers. Go ahead and get the source code zip file from the github page. Once you’ve unzipped the file, navigate to the Chrome extension url you see. Once there, click load the unpacked extension. Make sure you are in developer mode. When the install has completed you will see the inverted triangle / Dark Wallet logo at the top right.Start a new wallet. You’ll be shown a new wallet seed. Write it down to access your wallet in the future.It comes preloaded with three pockets labeled spending, business, and savings. You have the ability to send Bitcoin and keep a list of contacts. You also have the ability to chat and send questions directly to the Dark Wallet team.You can reveal your seed, assign a password to your seed, and verify that you are connected to unsystem’s servers. You can also change your base unit from BTC to mBTC or bits. You also have the ability to change your local currency from USD to Euros or several other currencies like the Dram, Peso, or Franc.You have the ability to import existing multisig wallets or create a new one.The stealth address generates new Bitcoin addresses for each transaction.Let us know what other Bitcoin software you would like to learn about. Cheers.Notes:We (Ruben, Paige, and I) tried only using the testnet, but that wasn’t functional during our tests.The other thing we noted is transactions take much longer than traditional Bitcoin transactions. We were seeing transactions show up after 20-30 minutes and longer if CoinJoin was enabled.Unlike some Bitcoin wallets you have the ability to view your seed passphrase if you’ve forgotten it.You can find a list of obelisk servers here.Dark Wallet stealth addresses are 102 characters long. They automatically generate a new public key for each transaction.Dark Wallet’s indiegogo campaign ran from October 2013 to December 2013 raised $2,075 dollars over their $50,000 fundraiser goal. They raised an additional 63.25 Bitcoins that wasn’t tracked by indiegogo.According to the indiegogo comments, several customers still haven’t received their cold storage cards or t-shirts associated with certain donation tiers.The highest donation tier on their indiegogo campaign was $5000 and included a flight to Europe to hang out with Amir Taaki and Cody Wilson along with the swag from the previous donation tiers.The Dark Wallet github page shows 34 open issues and 107 closed issues.Some of the notable open issues are:Related Links:",

    "text": "Earlier this year, Phil Champagne released a book called the Book of Satoshi.Phil is the managing director of Wren Investment Group and has a background in computer software and electrical engineering. The Book of Satoshi presents the most relevant discussions in which the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, participated.The beginning chapters introduce the idea of Bitcoin and mining, how and why it works, and a brief introduction to cryptographic concepts behind it. All of the terms necessary to understand the majority of the book are clarified in these chapters. After the informative intro, the first ever post about Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto is presented.In the rest of the book, the rest of Satoshi’s most relevant posts and email conversations are provided in chronological order; on many of them Satoshi addresses concerns of the early readers of the posts on different topics, ranging from questions on mining to the formation of the current Bitcoin logo. Satoshi provides his view of the technological and economic implications of Bitcoin throughout the forum posts.Preceding each chapter is a brief summary of the post contained in it, putting it into proper context for the reader. This helps unravel the tale of the continuous development of bitcoin technology. As the book progresses, the timeline of Bitcoin’s early growth and development seems to come together; at the end of the book, the original whitepaper that introduced Bitcoin to the world is presented. I found this to be a clever place to insert the paper. After revisiting the paper, I realized that the book as a whole allowed me to more thoroughly understand its intricacies. Overall, the book provides information that readers from any professional background can get something from.The Book of Satoshi’s pseudo-encyclopedic structure allows the reader to jump across different topics depending on the info they’re seeking. After reading the book, it becomes clear what Satoshi wanted to fulfill with Bitcoin: a system that attempts to free individuals from the many problems inherent in our broken financial system.By the time the reader completes The Book of Satoshi, he or she will be considerably more knowledgeable about many aspects of Bitcoin. The most asked concerns about bitcoin technology will be fresh in their mind; this calls for great conversation starters about the technology.To conclude, here is an excerpt contained in the book from a forum post in August 27, 2010, in which Satoshi attempted to clarify the function of Bitcoin currency by providing a small thought experiment.“As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal scarce as gold but with the following properties:boring grey in colournot a good conductor of electricitynot particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable eithernot useful for any practical or ornamental purposeand one special, magical property:can be transported over a communications channelIf it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it….”This is Bitcoin.The book website is here.",

    "title": "Kevin Cruz wrote about the Hive Wallet team back in March 2014 as they were looking for developers. It seems",
    "text": "Kevin Cruz wrote about the Hive Wallet team back in March 2014 as they were looking for developers. It seems they’ve not only found developers, but already have released a wallet.Creating a WalletWhen you first visit Hive’s web wallet url, you can either open an existing wallet or create a new one. Hive creates a new wallet using a twelve word passphrase which is similar to the method used to create a brainwallet. Hive takes the security of their wallets one step further and requires users to assign a pin number to their wallet.The next page reflects Hive minimalist design aesthetic by providing three cleanly laid out options for wallet users which lets them send and receive bitcoin, and view their transaction history.Send BitcoinWhen you click on the send tab you can paste a wallet address and enter an amount of bitcoin to send. Clicking confirm, sends the payment. The blue button to the right of the Bitcoin address field allows users to broadcast their address to nearby hive wallet users who have enabled a feature called waggle, which I’ll discuss in the next section.Receive BitcoinThe middle tab provides users with the tools to receive Bitcoin. There is a text field that displays your Bitcoin address, and a familiar option to display the QR-code that represents your public key.Below this option is a killer feature called waggle that broadcasts your public key to nearby hive wallet users. This does away with having to scan QR-codes and allows for seamless in-person transactions. I can imagine this being used at a meetup where one person can pay for a bill and everyone else can pitch in without having each person on the bill scan a QR code to pay their bill.SettingsYou can access the wallets settings by clicking on the gear at the top left of the screen. When I tried this wallet I had to click twice. Here you have the opportunity to associate your name with your wallet and add your gravatar email which grabs your profile picture if you have a gravatar account configured. This feature is extremely useful if you want to visually find a specific transaction using a picture of your friend or name in your transaction history.You also have options to use a Litecoin wallet, logout, or submit a support ticket.Transaction HistoryThe transaction history lists all the transactions associated with this wallet and includes the gravatar profile picture and name of the person who sent the transaction. This feature lets the transaction lists be more memorable than a list of public keys.Suggested ImprovementsClicking refresh on the browser prompts the user to re-enter their pin. There should be a warning here before refreshing the page.Clicking on the settings gear sometimes reveals a blank page. Clicking the gear again shows the options I’ve described. These options should be accessible with one click.It would also be nice to see a place holders for future wallets before they are fully released along with the wallets that are currently supported.The transaction history should be searchable by gravatar name, or public key.The transaction history should allow for date and amount filtering.Questions for Wendell and WeiRuben Alexander: What elements of your wallet are open source?Wendell Davis: 100 of it.https://github.com/hivewallethttps://github.com/hivewallet/hive-jsIf your site goes down, will wallet users lose access to their wallets?If we go down and they have written down their BIP32 passphrase, they can enter it into any BIP32/BIP39-compatible wallet and have access to their funds again. We do not store private keys.Will the same passphrase and pin combination work on your hive Mac wallet?Not yet unfortunately. That will be updated for BIP32/BIP39 support soon, but it has not been [done] yet.Wei, do you use iBeacon to detect hive wallet public keys? How close should Hive wallet users be when using waggle?Wei Lu: No we don’t use iBeacon. HTML5 is a blessing and a curse — in this case, being a pure HTML5 wallet means that we don’t get access to iBeacon on mobile devices.Instead we took a rather simple approach by using browser’s geolocation API to gather user’s location info. The wallet then sends the data to server, sever will reply with any other known active waggle users within 1km radius. As soon as user turns off waggle, the wallet instructs the server to erase the location data from memory.QR code scanning is the go-to answer for native wallet apps to answer the question, “How do I pay someone nearby?” Again, as a pure HTML5 wallet, we face the challenge with QR code scanning — the access to camera on mobile devices is limited through the HTML5 getUserMedia API (http://caniuse.com/stream). Even with access to camera, unlike native apps where people can hold and move around until the QR code is recognized, the best a web app can do at the moment is to have user take a picture of the QR code, upload to server for processing, then if the user is lucky, the server finds a valid QR code in the picture, if not, the user will have to take another picture. Overall, it’s a clunky user experience. We want to provide a great user experience with the current set of tools available to us, therefore [we] waggle. Are there any other cryptocurrencies the Hive wallet will support besides Litecoin and Bitcoin?[In the] short term, Dogecoin is the next one we are looking at supporting. In long term, we want to support as many tokens as possible.Final ThoughtsI am very happy with this wallet as its minimalist layout and waggle feature make it extremely easy to use. This would be a perfect wallet for first time Bitcoin users or those who enjoy Hive Wallet’s design.",

    "title": "Verso is a really interesting new hardware gadget that seeks to make your bitcoin life convenient and secure. Calling it",
    "text": "Verso is a really interesting new hardware gadget that seeks to make your bitcoin life convenient and secure. Calling it a gadget is somewhat of a misnomer, its just a piece of plastic (yes just like a credit card) with bitcoin keys and QR codes on both sides of the card. One is your public key and the other is your private key (sorta).Unboxing, The ExperienceBut first let’s get to the unboxing. More accurately the envelope opening. Remember it’s just a little card so they ship it in an envelope. By the way, even though it comes from Switzerland it took less than a week to show up in the USA. The envelope please:The envelope, it came from SwitzerlandThe “letter” with Verso card attachedPhysical DesignNow let’s examine the actual card. Printed on one side is the QR code for the public key of your address, and on the other side the private key. But WAIT A MINUTE! If someone knows the public and private keys of one of your bitcoin addresses then they could steal all your coins! right? Well no so quick. It turns out that the private key is encrypted (with AES-256).Yes, it’s a piece of plastic, but quite niceBoth sides of the card look identical, however they are subtly different. The portion with the QR code is printed with a textual texture. On one side it says “PUBLICPUBLICPUBLIC” and on the other “PRIVATEPRIVATEPRIVATE” such that it attractively creates a texture. It actually looks pretty good and has a nice functional design.The “PUBLIC” and “PRIVATE” textured sides of the Verso card.Buying the Verso CardLet’s backtrack and bit and explain the Verso ordering process. Go to the Verso site at: https://versocards.com/Verso home pageThe “buy” pageYou are presented with a nice looking web page which is very simple to use. Kudos to the Verso folks for creating a very usable site (NOT TRIVIAL). I purchased the “silver” card not the “gold” one which apparently offers some capability of reconstructing your wallet if you lose it, but I don’t really know anything about it so won’t say anything else.After you click the button “Add a Verso Silver” to your cart a popup appears on your web page. It asks you for a name for your card, which can be something simple like “Sandy”, and then you must also enter a password. Do not enter a simple password! This password that you create before you buy your Verso is the actual private key that you must know in order to access the new bitcoin address that will be created (and printed) on your Verso card. It is VERY VERY VERY important that you create a strong password, i.e. one that can not easily be guessed, and one that you will remember. If you forget the password you lose your bitcoins.Popup asking for card name and password, part of purchase processThe card is in many respects the simple part of the Verso system; the real magic of making this thing useful is the app. Along with the Verso card you need to install the Verso Wallet app on your smartphone. There is an app for Apple iPhones and Google Android phones. I’ve only used the iPhone version so I can’t say anything about the Android version.Using the Verso AppLaunch the app and you’re presented with a login screen.Verso app login screenPress the login button and it then asks you to scan the PRIVATE side of your Verso card. Then you’re logged in! You do not have to type in the password just to login and that turns out to be just fine. You can receive bitcoins using the PUBLIC key but you can’t spend bitcoins without the password. The Verso folks have done a great job balancing convenience with security. Typing the password is a pain, as is any long sequence on the phone, but you only need to do it when spending bitcoins. Again, from a usability point of view, it works great. You simply login (or the app can remain logged in until explicitly logged out) by scanning the card and boom, you’re in.By the way the Verso web site has a very cool practice area that lets you pretend you have the card. You download the actual app and they will send you a tiny fractional amount of bitcoin to practice using it. It lets you practice using the app before you have the card. You can then donate the fractional coin to a charity, nice touch! It’s a very effective way of holding your hand and convincing you to buy the card before you actually have it. It worked on me!Now let’s spend!On the bottom of the app are three icons for the three modes of the app: Account, Receive, and Send. Click the Send and let’s spend some coin. The destination field is actually blank when you go there for the first time. Scanning a bitcoin QR code or typing in a bitcoin address tells the app where to send the coins. Next, you type in the amount of bitcoin you wish to send. Finally you click send and now you are presented with a confirmation screen in which you must type that private key password. Remember it’s the same password you created when you bought the Verso card in the first place.The destination (where you will send coins) screenThe confirmation of the destination screenTo receive bitcoins you select the Receive icon (the + sign) and you are presented with a screen that has an image of the PUBLIC key side of the Verso card. This would let you simply hold up the phone to someone who wants to send you bitcoins and scan right from your phone. Alternately you can send the address via email. It’s quick and convenient.The “receive” screenIn summary the Verso card folks have managed to create a product that gives you the security of cold storage with the convenience of a hot wallet. It’s way more convenient than a paper wallet and can easily sit in your physical leather wallet ready for use. The encryption of the private key and presentation as a QR code make it secure and convenient. It doesn’t matter if you lose the card or if someone steals it, they won’t get your coins because they need your password. The real magic that ties all the functionality together is the Verso Card app. It lets you access your wallet to send and receive bitcoins quickly, efficiently and most importantly securely. The Verso card lets you not compromise convenience for security, and that’s not a simple trick.",

    "title": "Short Answer: A Bitcoin address is a unique number that “holds” bitcoin currency. You use the address to receive and",
    "text": "Short Answer: A Bitcoin address is a unique number that “holds” bitcoin currency. You use the address to receive and send bitcoins.Medium Sized Answer: A Bitcoin address is the public key half of the public-private key pair that enables the validation of ownership of that address. WHOAH there, what in tarnation does that mean?? Bitcoin addresses are created as part of a key generation process that creates a pair of keys. They are a matched set, where one is public and the other is private. When you “sign” a bitcoin address you are running the public and private keys through an algorithm that checks to see that those keys belong together. Usually signing is talked about in the context of a message. Someone sends you a signed message and you can verify that the message came from the genuine person. You can verify the message because it was signed with their private key and you match it to their public key. When sending bitcoins the signed message is a portion of the bitcoin transaction and you do not explicitly see the message, it is just part of the transaction. This lets you validate the ownership of the address. The transaction (the transfer of value) was signed with the owner’s private key and you check that it’s valid using their public key.A little diversion – public key cryptography is a really cool technology developed in the mid 1970’s. The amazing thing about public-private key pairs is that everyone can know the public key and the owner of the private key can prove that he is the owner of the message sent with the associated public key. For more information on PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) upon which much of bitcoin’s security is based see Mike Hearn’s (a core bitcoin developer) great description of many issues in “Why you think the PKI sucks…but can’t do any better“.A Longer Story: Let look at the sequence of actions to create and then use the key pairs. First we need to generate the key pair, which will result in two keys the public and private keys. The Bitcoin address is actually a form of the public key (it’s a hash of the public key). From the Bitcoin protocol specification at: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification#SignaturesA bitcoin address is in fact the hash of a ECDSA public keySince anyone can know the public key and really the Bitcoin address is the public key, it’s perfectly OK to give out the Bitcoin address. So now we have a Bitcoin address, what’s next? Let’s say that I want to get paid for something, say writing this article! I can advertise a Bitcoin address, and since you are all so thrilled to read this, you have an overwhelming urge to send me some coins. You would open up your Bitcoin wallet, enter my address as the address to send bitcoins to; click send; and I would happily receive some bitcoins. Recall that I and only I have the private key matching the public key (address) which enables me to be the only person that could spend the bitcoins I just received. If you wanted to double check that I was actually the owner of the address before you sent me coins you could ask that I send a signed message associated with address proving it’s mine. I could create a message and sign the address. You would then take the message I sent, and put it into your wallet along with my address to prove that I am the “owner” of the address. Bitcoin wallets usually contain this message signing and verification functionality. An address is used to “hold” bitcoins, however the concept of an address holding bitcoins or that you are the “owner” of a Bitcoin address is a misnomer. Recall that the address is one half of a public-private key pair. The reason you “own” an address and have control over the coins associated with that address is simply that you also know the other half of the public-private key pair, the private key. If someone else learns the private key to an address then that person has just as much control and “ownership” over the address, as you. In other words that person can spend your bitcoins. The solution is quite simple, make sure you and only you control the public keys to your bitcoin addresses. From a practical point of view this means that you create a good, not easy to guess, Bitcoin wallet password, and/or keep it in a safe place. Some excellent security practices are outlined at the Bitcoin Foundation’s site at: https://bitcoin.org/en/secure-your-wallet. Since Bitcoin addresses are one of the cornerstones to using Bitcoin, it is instructive to play around with addresses to get a better understanding of just what exactly a Bitcoin address is all about. A particularly good website to play around with is bitaddress.org. After generating a new Bitcoin address play around with the various options and observe the public and private keys it generates. Just don’t go putting real bitcoins into an address while also displaying the private key. Keep the private key private!",

    "text": "Are you working on a Bitcoin project? The latest open-source Bitcoin project, Bitcore has been launched to make it easier than ever to develop apps that interact with the real Bitcoin network. Bitcore is a complete, native interface to the Bitcoin network, providing a pure and powerful core for your Bitcoin project.Designed by BitPay, Bitcore has been launched in order to encourage developers to build software that directly interfaces with the Bitcoin network. As a powerful peer-to-peer network, Bitcoin is the next generation of financial technology; and because of the decentralized nature of the network, developers must be resilient and reliable, which makes open-source projects pivotal to forward progress. According to bitcore.io, “Bitcore unchains developers from fallible, centralized API’s, and provides the tools to interact with the real Bitcoin network.”In the eyes of developers contemplating new Bitcoin projects, utilizing proprietary or centralized APIs hosted by closed software makes innovation very difficult. In contrast, Bitcore’s open-source model will drive continued development and implementation of Bitcoin applications and services.Bitcore is an open-source JavaScript library that has the capability of doing anything imaginable with the Bitcoin protocol; and is designed to run server-side on node.js or client side within a web browser. Bitcore is able to interact with a trusted Bitcoin node, such as a bitcoind instance. Bitcore was created from an internal fork of Stefan Thomas’ bitcoinjs project, which many other Bitcoin companies and projects have used. In order to ensure the sufficient out-of-the-box capability and to attract developers to begin using Bitcore, it was decided to make the fork open-source.The launch of Bitcore was supported by an initial project called Insight, which expressed the platform’s usability in real Bitcoin projects. Insight is a simple block chain explorer and is an example of the benefits and open-source technology behind Bitcore.Bitcore can be installed from npm with class-like idioms available via Classtool. Examples of the extensive uses of Bitcore can be found at bitcore.io and on GitHub. There are several projects currently underway including Bitcoin address validation, block and transaction monitoring, live block chain exploration, creating and sending a transaction through P2P, parsing a script, consuming bitcoind RPC - the list is expanding daily as more developers get involved.According to bitcore.io, “BitPay’s Bitcore is still under heavy development and is not yet ready for “drop-in” production use.” However, the nature of open-source makes it possible for anyone, whether developer or not, to submit security issues along with bug fixes, ideas for improvement and code optimization.Bitcore will help drive the creativity and continued development of Bitcoin and its community of innovative individuals. By interacting with the real Bitcoin network, developers will be able to actively create Bitcoin projects that are unique to their requirements, and share them with the Bitcore community. Bitcore takes a collaborative approach to developing Bitcoin projects and ideas, and is the first platform that has the ability to interact with the real Bitcoin network. Join the action at http://bitcore.io",

    "text": "If you are looking to purchase a pre-owned vehicle with Bitcoin, look no further �� Beepi has made it a possibility. With the help of BitPay, the California-based company has integrated bitcoin payment support for its continually expanding line-up of pre-owned automobiles. Beepi has become the first peer-to-peer marketplace to allow customers to purchase cars with bitcoin, further solidifying the role of digital currency in mainstream applications.Buying a car is a person’s second largest financial purchase and the integration of bitcoin payments further supports the company’s mission to create the most hassle-free way to purchase a vehicle online. What Beepi is doing is commendable, eliminating the stressful barriers that are often associated with purchasing an automobile. In addition, the company is also offering prospective buyers pre-approval for loans at check-out and a ten-day money-back guarantee.Beepi was founded last year and emerged into the used-auto market in a time when innovation in such an industry was hard to find. With Beepi, gone are the days of traveling to the dealership and spending hours haggling price and features, or utilizing an online service that takes just as much time and requires the same hoops to jump through as traditional car purchasing methods. Instead, Beepi directly connects buyers and sellers on a platform that is easy to use, one that eliminates overpriced commissions and the burden of haggling price. By adding bitcoin payment support, Beepi is working hard to create a new way to buy a used car, in a way that benefits all parties involved.Buyers wishing to purchase their next vehicle with Bitcoin can do so by completing an easy process. After selecting a car, the buyer can select “check out” and choose “bitcoin” as the payment option. BitPay gives the seller the ability to allow the buyer to pay via bitcoin and still receive cash in the end. Additionally, Beepi also offers a variety of financing options, one of which is the company’s easy loan pre-approval process which also occurs within the check-out environment.A year ago, buying a car with Bitcoin was unheard of. Since then many individuals have purchased cars from dealerships offering luxury brands like Tesla, Range Rover and Lamborghini. Excitingly enough, Beepi is one of the first used-car platforms to offer such a payment option.Bitcoin’s role in automobile sales is solidifying as more and more dealerships and online providers like Beepi are choosing to accept Bitcoin. Because a car is often an individual’s second largest lifetime purchase and isn’t often done with cash, the thought of Bitcoin makes complete sense. There are many financial hurdles and fees that have always been associated with purchasing an automobile, but Bitcoin can enable online services like Beepi to save its customers a large percentage on the final cost. “Integrating with bitcoin is a natural extension of our promise to deliver the easiest way to purchase a car in the 21stcentury,” Beepi CEO Ale Resnik stated.",

    "text": "In the last installment of this series, we talked about what “smart contracts” (or, perhaps more accurately, “self-enforcing contracts”) are, and discussed in detail the two main mechanisms through which these contracts can have “force”: smart property and “factum” currencies. We also discussed the limits of smart contracts, and how a smart contract-enabled legal system might use a combination of human judgement and automatic execution to achieve the best possible outcomes. But what is the point of these contracts? Why automate? Why is it better to have our relationships regulated and controlled by algorithms rather than humans? These are the tough questions that this article, and the next, intends to tackle.A Tale of Two IndustriesThe first, and most obvious, benefit of using internet-driven technology to automate anything is the exact same that we have seen the internet, and Bitcoin, already provide in the spheres of communications and commerce: it increases efficiency and reduces barriers to entry. One very good example of this effect providing meaningful benefits in the traditional world is the publishing industry. In the 1970s, if you wanted to write a book, there was a large number of opaque, centralized intermediaries that you would need to go through before your book would get to a consumer. First, you would need a publishing company, which would also handle editing and marketing for you and provide a quality control function to the consumer. Second, the book would need to be distributed, and then finally it would be sold at each individual bookstore. Each part of the chain would take a large cut; at the end, you would be lucky to get more than ten percent of the revenue from each copy as a royalty. Notice the use of the term “royalty”, implying that you the author of the book are simply just another extraneous part of the chain that deserves a few percent as a cut rather than, well, the single most important person without whom the book would not even exist in the first place. Now, the situation is greatly improved. We now have distinct printing companies, marketing companies and bookstores, with a clear and defined role for each one and plenty of competition in each industry – and if you’re okay with keeping it purely digital, you can just publish on Kindle and get 70.Now, let’s consider a very similar example, but with a completely different industry: consumer protection, or more specifically escrow. Escrow is a very important function in commerce, and especially commerce online; when you buy a product from a small online store or from a merchant on Ebay, you are participating in a transaction where neither side has a substantial reputation, and so when you send the money by default there is no way to be sure that you will actually get anything to show for it. Escrow provides the solution: instead of sending the money to the merchant directly, you first send the money to an escrow agent, and the escrow agent then waits for you to confirm that you received the item. If you confirm, then the escrow agent sends the money along, and if the merchant confirms that they can’t send the item then the escrow agent gives you your money back. If there’s a dispute, an adjudication process begins, and the escrow agent decides which side has the better case.The way it’s implemented today, however, escrow is handled by centralized entities, and is thrown in together with a large number of other functions. On the online marketplace Ebay, for example, Ebay serves the role of providing a server for the seller to host their product page on, a search and price comparison function for products, and a rating system for buyers and sellers. Ebay also owns Paypal, which actually moves the money from the seller to the buyer and serves as the escrow agent. Essentially, this is exactly the same situation that book publishing was in in the 1970s, although in fairness to Ebay sellers do get quite a bit more than 10 of their money. So how can we make an ideal marketplace with cryptocurrencies and smart contracts? If we wanted to be extreme about it, we could make the marketplace decentralized, using a Diaspora-like model to allow a seller to host their products on a specialized site, on their own server or on a Decentralized Dropbox implementation, use a Namecoin-like system for sellers to store their identities and keep a web of trust on the blockchain. However, what we’re looking at now is a more moderate and simple goal: separating out the function of the escrow agent from the payment system. Fortunately, Bitcoin offers a solution: multisignature transactions.Introducing MultisigMultisignature transactions allow a user to send funds to an address with three private keys, such that you need two of those keys to unlock the funds (multisigs can also be 1-of-3, 6-of-9, or anything else, but in practice 2-of-3 is the most useful). The way to apply this to escrow is simple: create a 2-of-3 escrow between the buyer, the seller and the escrow agent, have the buyer send funds into it and when a transaction is complete the buyer and the seller sign a transaction to complete the escrow. If there is a dispute, the escrow agent picks which side has the more convincing case, and signs a transaction with them to send them the funds. On a technological level, this is slightly complicated, but fortunately Bitrated has come up with a site that makes the process quite easy for the average user.Of course, in its current form, Bitrated is not perfect, and we do not see that much Bitcoin commerce using it. The interface is arguably not as easy as it could be, especially since most people are not used to the idea of storing specific per-transaction links for a few weeks, and it would be much more powerful if it was integrated into a fully-fledged merchant package. One design might be a KryptoKit-like web app, showing each user a list of “open” buys and sells and providing a “finalize”, “accept”, “cancel” and “dispute” button for each one; users would then be able to interact with the multisig system just as if it was a standard payment processor, but then get a notification to finalize or dispute their purchases after a few weeks.But if Bitrated does get its interface right and starts to see mass adoption, what will that accomplish? Once again, the answer is reduced barriers to entry. Currently, getting into the consumer escrow and arbitration business is hard. In order to be an escrow service, you essentially need to build an entire platform and an ecosystem, so that consumers and merchants operate through you. You also can’t just be the one escrowing the money – you also need to be the one transferring the money in the first place. Ebay needs to have, and control, Paypal, in order for half of its consumer protection to work. With Bitrated, this all changes. Anyone can become an escrow agent and arbitrator, and an Ebay-like marketplace (perhaps CryptoThrift or the upcoming Egora) can have a rating system for arbitrators as well as buyers and sellers. Alternatively, the system could handle arbitration in the background similarly to how Uber handles taxi drivers: anyone could become an arbitrator after a vetting process, and the system would automatically reward arbitrators with good ratings and fire those with bad ratings. Fees would drop, likely substantially below even the 2.9 charged by Paypal alone.Smart ContractsSmart contracts in general take this same basic idea, and push it much further. Instead of relying on a platform like Bitfinex to hedge one’s Bitcoin holdings or speculate in either direction at high leverage, one can use a blockchain-based financial derivatives contract with a decentralized order book, leaving no central party to take any fees. The ongoing cost of maintaining an exchange, complete with operational security, server management, DDoS protection, marketing and legal expenses, could be replaced with a one-time effort to write the contract, likely in less than 100 lines of code, and another one-time effort to make a pretty interface. From that point on, the entire system would be free except for network fees. File storage platforms like Dropbox could be similarly replaced; although, since hard disk space costs money, the system would not be free, it would likely be substantially cheaper than it is today. It would also help equalize the market by making it easy to participate on the supply side: anyone with a big hard drive, or even a small hard drive with some extra space, can simply install the app and start earning money renting out their unused space.Instead of relying on legal contracts using expensive (and often, especially in international circumstances and poor countries, ineffective) court systems, or even moderately expensive private arbitration services, business relationships can be governed by smart contracts where those parts of the contract that do need human interpretation can be segregated into many specialized parts. There might be judges specializing in determining whether or not a product shipped (ideally, this would be the postal system itself), judges specializing in determining whether web application designs meet specifications, judges specializing in adjudicating certain classes of property insurance claims with a $0.75 fee by examining satellite images, and there would be contract writers skilled in intelligently integrating each one. Specialization has its advantages, and is the reason why society moved beyond running after bears with stone clubs and picking berries, but one of its weaknesses has always been the fact that it requires intermediaries to manage and function, including intermediaries specifically to manage the relationship between the intermediaries. Smart contracts can remove the latter category almost completely, allowing for an even greater degree of specialization, along with lower barriers to entry within each now shrunken category.However, this increase in efficiency is only one part of the puzzle. The other part, and perhaps the more important one, has to do with a topic that many cryptocurrency advocates hold dear: reducing trust. We will cover that in the next installment of this series.",

    "text": "Bojan Simic, the founder of the Bitcoin Security Project, has released a new, free, and open source bitcoin wallet for Android called Aegis Wallet.The wallet supports multiple currencies and provides the user with the ability to view their transactions and addresses on the bitcoin blockchain.Aegis Wallet allows you to encrypt your wallet. If someone were to get a hold of your Android phone it will be impossible for them to take your bitcoins. All you would have to do is get another phone, import a backup from your email, and go on about your sweet life.“We have Designed Aegis for security from the ground up,” says Bojan. “The Aegis wallet,” he adds, “is developed using the highest standards in the fields of cryptography and information security. We utilize proven security algorithms and protocols. Moreover, our team leverages years of knowledge and experience in software development and security to deliver you a first class application and user experience.”In addition, Aegis wallet also allows you to encrypt your wallet with a password or an NFC tag that is small enough to fit on a keychain that can be used to authorize the sending of bitcoin from your wallet. If your device supports NFC, you simply tap the NFC tag to your device whenever you want to move your bitcoins.“My hope for the Aegis Wallet is that Bitcoin users can have a wallet to use that they can rely on for both usability and security,” says Bojan. “If used as intended, the wallet can provide users with peace of mind that their money is safe in the event of loss, theft, or malware. We think this is much more important than in traditional payment systems such as credit cards because bitcoin transactions are not reversible.”If a user forgets a password or loses their NFC tag, the Bitcoin Security Project may be able to help the user recover their funds with an encrypted backup file provided by the user. Other bitcoin wallets are unable to do this.I have downloaded the wallet, and have found it to be extremely easy to use and quick. After downloading the app, it requests for you to enter a strong password or to tap NFC device. Next, the app asks if you want to backup your wallet. After choosing yes or no, you’re ready to use the wallet. Enjoy!The security standards on the wallet follow those created by the Bitcoin Security Project. As more and more people adopt bitcoin, it will be of the utmost importance that they secure their funds, even if they don’t know what encryption is. I see Aegis wallet as an important contribution to the Wallet space because of its strong security standards. It also helps that the user interface looks pretty cool.Download Aegis Wallet for Android here.",

    "text": "Imagine walking into your favorite coffee shop, electronics store or restaurant, and paying for everything you need with the flick of your wrist. Today, Nymi (NIM-mi) makes this possible and more importantly, allows Bitcoin users to store their Bitcoin in a native biometric wallet.Bionym’s Nymi wearable armband uses your unique ECG (electrocardiogram) biometric signature to securely identify you to various services and devices. The Toronto-based startup will also provide Nymi users with an easy to use and secure Bitcoin wallet. This is the first wearable Bitcoin wallet, and will enable consumers to make secure payments using the most secure digital payment method, without having to use your phone, tablet or computer.In a recent Techcrunch interview, Bionym President Andrew D’Souza stated, “What Nymi brings to the table is a way to keep the private key securely stored independent of any computer, and tied to your unique ECG biometric signature. This makes it not only secure, but also more convenient than existing Bitcoin wallet solutions.”Wearable technology has been around for years and has been widely used for tracking fitness activity. Companies like Samsung just recently dove into wearable tech and rumor has it that Apple currently has another in development. However, Nymi is the first technology that has merged the ability to make payments with wearable tech. Bionym’s innovation has many implications for both consumers and businesses, especially those in the Bitcoin community.What Nymi Means for BusinessesAn aspect of Bitcoin that has been challenging for brick-and-mortar businesses has been the payment process itself. Nymi provides an effortless and streamlined Bitcoin transaction process that will be customer facing, while enabling even greater transaction efficiency. The act of buying your favorite drink at Starbucks with Bitcoin can be a reality with Bionym’s new product.Still, a challenge remains for many brick-and-mortar businesses looking to accept Bitcoin. How do you integrate Bitcoin into an existing POS? The answer has been given by many companies who provide payment integration, but very few actually integrate directly into every point-of-sale platform. For Bionym’s Nymi, this could mean that their native wallet may just be a way to secure and store Bitcoin in a unique and wearable way. However, with the rapid growth and adoption of Bitcoin, major retailers are searching for ways to get ahead and Nymi will soon capitalize on its innovation.What Nymi Means for ConsumersConsumers are always looking for new and secure ways to pay for what they need. We have seen firsthand the cost of fraud with the recent data breach at Target stores nationwide, which accounted to over $1 billion in fraudulent purchases. It is obvious that the security of our money and our payment methods is more important than ever.Nymi is tied directly to an individual’s ECG biometric signature, which means that if it is lost, nobody can access your funds. The technology within Nymi works much like Bitcoin, as both are backed by security that is built into the code. When you complete a transaction using Bitcoin, each user agrees to the amount and the transaction is verified multiple times. This happens nearly instantaneously and because each user agrees upon the transaction, there is no security risk, unlike other payment methods. Nymi brings this technology into the wearable tech space.This new wearable tech will drastically increase the adoption of Bitcoin, both in business and by consumers. Not only will individuals be able to store their funds on a device that is directly tied to their biometrics, but they will also be able to effortlessly pay for goods and services. It makes perfect sense for Bionym to integrate a Bitcoin wallet into the Nymi. For Bitcoin, Nymi will bring new light to the already fastest growing mobile payment method. It will drive individual adoption and sales for businesses who already accept Bitcoin. For businesses who do not accept Bitcoin - it’s not too late.",

    "text": "The time has come for starving artists to finally make real money from their music. As the Internet disrupted the way record labels make their money, the blockchain is taking this another step by threatening to render them useless. PeerTracks is matching the artist up with the audience and allowing them to both make money, all the while spreading knowledge of the blockchain to the mainstream.I got a chance to speak with Cédric Cobban, the individual who, along with Eddie Corral, is orchestrating the unique Peertracks effort.What is PeerTracks?PeerTracks is a music streaming/retail website that plugs into the BitShares Music blockchain. It’s a user friendly front end aimed at the masses, allowing them to benefit from all the advantages crypto brings without the need to understand or even know what a blockchain is.What does PeerTracks do?For an artist, it’s a platform to sell your music and engage your fans through the creation and sale of your own artistcoins, whose value is tied to the sale of your music. This incentivizes artistcoin holders to promote you, get you to stardom and increase your sales – all this without a middleman taking a cut.For a fan/regular user, it’s a place to buy cheaper music and know all your funds are going to the artist. It’s a place to discover new music and benefit by buying the coins of artists you think will be big. Being avant-garde has never been so lucrative!PeerTracks essentially ties price discovery with talent discovery since the value of an artist’s coin is tied to his music’s sales.How does it work?Everything PeerTracks allows is made possible by the BitShares Music blockchain. BitShares Music is essentially a spinoff of BitSharesX, only tweaked to make it better suited for the music economy.PeerTracks users will spend and earn BitUSD, a crypto-currency market pegged to the US dollar. This shields our users (which are not day traders) from the volatility normally present with crypto-currencies while still benefiting from the many advantages like low fees.This blockchain is a decentralized exchange; many things trade on it. First, there are Notes, the unit of the blockchain. Then there are artistcoins, which are user issued assets created by the artists to sell (or give away) to their fans. Think Snoopcoin, Biebercoin, etc.Third and finally, there are BitAssets, like the BitUSD, which are market pegged to their real world counterparts and are collateralized by Notes, meaning all BitAssets are backed by units of the blockchain.All trades are done ON blockchain. No centralized exchanges required in:the purchase of music (a fan sending BitUSD to the band)the trading of artistcoins (Snoopcoin for Rihannacoin, or Biebercoin for BitUSD)the trading of Notes for BitAssets or artistcoinsPeerTracks never holds any funds. All trades are done peer 2 peer, on blockchain, no trust required.What is your vision for PeerTracks?PeerTracks and BitShares Music are going to change the entire digital content economy.Not only does Peertracks cut out extremely inefficient middlemen, but it also links the fans, the artists and the promoters’ incentives towards the same goal: getting songs and albums out to the world and generating as many sales as possible. Napster changed the world, yes, but it shortchanged the content creators. Incentives did not align… simple as that. This project will change the way small time artists are funded, how they are promoted and how they make a living from their music. The artist’s coin being tied to sales of music is one thing but combining this with “token controlled access” allows artists to bring value to their fans at relatively low cost. For example, an artist could grant backstage passes to anyone with over 100 of his artistcoin.The model does not stop at music. This concept can be used for movies, ebooks, and even physical goods traded online (eBay could adopt this model for example)What are you currently busy with?We are getting BitShares Music and PeerTracks launched. We are presently focused on our pre-sale which started october 6th. Anyone can claim their stake in the future of music by going towww.bitsharesmusicfoundation.orgWhat is your professional background?Eddie Corral’s background is 25 plus years working with the biggest names and companies in the music business. He brings years of copyright, publishing, marketing and promotions experience with independent and major label artists – from sheet music to download he has taken many artist from recording studio to radio.For myself [Cédric Cobban]: I am a small time entrepreneur in a relatively small town called Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada. Co-owner of an MMA gym + real estate investments (not too relevant to technology!)My interest in Austrian economics and investing led me to Bitcoin in 2011 which led me to BitShares… which consumed me!What would you like to tell our readers?We would like them to know that they have about 45 days left to participate in the NOTE pre-sale. If you see value in what we are doing and realize that this technology we can displace a multi billion dollar industry, check out the pre-sale at www.bitsharesmusicfoundation.org and be a part of it.",

    "text": "This article, which first appeared in Issue 16, takes a brief look into Tim Fillmore's TitanBTC project and what makes his cold storage coin unique from the others on the market. Before TitanBTC, Tim Fillmore previously worked on making a humor brand called ShutUpImTalking.com.“During the 2010 elections, ShutUpImTalking.com had more hits than the Presidential debate. Even when you combine both candidates data,” he said reflecting on his previous venture during our late morning call.His experience in pursuing niche markets would eventually spill over into his current venture, TitanBTC, a coin minting company whose products double as cold storage wallets. This has been done before with the Casascius coin, but with their crackable holographic protection shown to be vulnerable at Defcon 2013, the market for cold storage coins is still wide open.Ruben Alexander: How were you introduced to Bitcoin?Tim Fillmore: Early in 2010, I was an engineer for a company that does research and development for startup companies. It was late 2010 and I was working with a client working on cryptographic techniques. It looked like play money at the time, but I didn’t look into it more at this point and time. I don’t think I gave it a second thought until the big spike and crash. Then I realized at that point and time, that money couldn’t have value. I realized virtual currencies were just as real as cash. I had a friend who was designing digital models for Second Life and he was making 30 of his income with virtual assets.I realized if people are working in a virtual world with virtual currencies, there’s no reason virtual currencies can’t have value in the real world.What type of metals do you use to make the coin?  The coins available now are made out of goldine. It’s essentially a copper alloy, but has the look and feel of 14 karat gold. There are different metals for different denominations. The next step down is a half bitcoin made of nickel. The quarter Bitcoin is going to be a copper color. And another nickle like metal for the .1 Bitcoin. The 5 BTC will be silver and the 10 BTC coin will be gold.How long are these coins expected to last?  They are durable. That’s one of the criteria we have. I don’t expect that they’ll tarnish unless they get exposed to toxic fumes.How do you store these coins?We store them in their case at the manufacturer. Every coin that we ship out comes in a polycarbonate case.What humidity, light exposure, temperature is ideal for these coins?We don’t recommend they [be] kept in direct sunlight, but the polycarbonate case will block the UV rays and keep them airtight.The Casascius coin was cracked using a non-polar solvent to reveal the coin’s private key. I know your coin uses 2 factor authentication to add an additional layer of protection. Can you describe your methods of keeping the coin secure?In order to prevent our coin private keys being compromised with a solvent hack or counterfeit coins, we use a coin registration process so the current owner of the coin has to have an email address registered to the coin. Even if the redemption code was compromised, they still would be the only ones who have access to the code.It is a step in the right direction. We are interested in moving forward the development to have more secure and decentralized solutions.With the hardware and software creating the private keys for the coins, what measure are you taking to make sure no one can hack into the computers making the private key used with these coins?The redemption coins and the private key are made within a batch on offline computers, the hard drives in those computers are securely wiped and the operating system is reloaded on the computer.We’re pretty sure that there is no way to recover the private keys at this point.I also saw you will recover 110 of the losses if someone’s coin is hacked?Yes.What type of coverage allows users to claim this 110 loss.The bottom line is… if someone hacks our system, or has their key compromised with any type of attack. Any compromise of our end-to-end system has access to this warranty. We offer it because TitanBTC is all about trust.

    "text": "Disclosure: the author of this article is the founder and Chief Scientist of the Ethereum projectLast week, Adam Back and Austin Hill came out with an announcement on Let’s Talk Bitcoin, in which they announced their newest project: “sidechains”. The idea, they described, would allow for the existence of alternative blockchains, perhaps with different rules allowing various kinds of additional features or transaction types, but with a currency unit whose value is pegged to that of the bitcoin. The intent is to allow experimentation with different extensions to the Bitcoin protocol, using separate networks to avoid any risk to Bitcoin itself, while still using the same underlying currency unit. As soon as the idea was announced, there has been a large amount of public interest in the concept, and has brought renewed hope that the Bitcoin protocol can potentially become much more powerful than it is today.Under the HoodThe idea behind sidechains is not new; the concept has been around since at least last year in December, and a precursor to the idea has been around for several years before then. The precursor, a protocol known as one-way pegging, was a mechanism that would theoretically be used to manage a transition from “Bitcoin 1.0″ to “Bitcoin 2.0″, and worked as follows. Suppose that, in Bitcoin 1.0, 13 million currency units have already been issued through mining, with 8 million still left to give out. The distribution model for BTC2.0 would release 8 million units through mining, according to the exact same schedule as BTC1.0 after that point, but the other 13 million would be distributed through a mechanism known as “proof-of-burn”.Essentially, one would take one unit of BTC1.0, send it to an unspendable address (eg. 1111111111111111111114oLvT2), and submit a cryptographic proof that this transaction took place, signed by the same private key that sent the transaction, as a transaction into Bitcoin 2.0. According to the Bitcoin 2.0 protocol, this would entitle the user to receive one unit of 2.0. This is called a “one-way peg” because the value of one BTC2.0 can be at most equal to one BTC1.0; otherwise, people would arbitrage the difference by converting the bitcoins over at the 1:1 rate. However, aside from selling BTC2.0 for BTC1.0 on the market, there is no way to go back, so if the experiment fails the value of BTC2.0 could drop to zero.Bitcoin sidechains use an improved version of this system called “two-way pegging”, which works as follows. In order to receive one unit of BTC2.0, one would need to take one unit of BTC1.0 and send it into a “script” which we will call X and leave undescribed for now. A script in Bitcoin is an address that, instead of being owned by a private key, essentially acts as a lockbox that unlocks the bitcoins only when given a transaction that satisfies certain conditions. For example, one can have a script that unlocks the funds to the first person who submits a fifty-digit prime number consisting entirely of the digits 3 and 5. Making the transaction, and publishing a cryptographic proof that such a transaction was made, into the Bitcoin 2.0 blockchain entitles the user to one unit of BTC2.0.Now, the definition of X is simple: X unlocks the funds (remember, this is one unit of BTC1.0) if given a valid cryptographic proof that the sender destroyed one unit of BTC2.0. Thus, there exists a mechanism for converting BTC 1.0 to BTC2.0, and that very mechanism creates another mechanism, limited in value to the total number of BTC2.0 created, which can be used to convert BTC2.0 back to BTC1.0. Hence, two-way peg.The mechanism that these “cryptographic proofs” use relies on a cryptographic construction used in Bitcoin called a Merkle tree. In a Bitcoin block, instead of simply having every transaction the block directly, only a single 32-byte hash is actually included in the block header. This 32-byte hash is itself calculated from two other 32-byte hashes, each of which comes from two other 32-byte hashes, and so forth until finally the values at the bottom are the transactions themselves. It is precisely the point of this mechanism to allow for the existence of compact proofs that a specific transaction is in a specific block; all that one needs is the one branch of hashes going up from that transaction to the root node, or a total of 10 hashes for 1000 transactions or 20 hashes for one million transactions. This is impossible to forge; if you try to change even a single transaction in the tree, the changes propagate upward through the hashes until finally the root node ends up completely different.However, this does not solve the problem completely; all it tells you is that some block, somewhere, contains a given transaction. It does not tell you that the transaction is in the main chain; in reality, the same bitcoins used in the transaction could have already been sent to a different source, making the transaction invalid. There are two ways to solve this. One approach, and by far the simpler one, is for the proof mechanism in Bitcoin 2.0 to ask not just for the Merkle tree branch, but also for the blockchain going back six blocks, much like a merchant asking for six confirmations, using mining power as a proxy for validity. For higher security, a much larger number of blocks like sixty can be required. This approach is simple, and seems to meet all of the required parameters.ChallengesThe above mechanism, however, as described is highly imperfect. When an ordinary merchant asks for six confirmations, pulling off a double-spend attack against that merchant requires producing six blocks faster than the rest of the network combined in real time, a task which requires at least 30 of total network hashpower to work with any non-negligible success rate. With the above described two-way-pegging mechanism, however, a malicious miner with even 1 of hashpower can generate six blocks, or even sixty blocks, eventually, and then use these blocks to fraudulently claim all BTC1.0 that have been put into the BTC2.0 lockboxes (or, in the other direction, fraudulently claim an unlimited number of BTC2.0). One possible patch that may come to mind is requiring the same person who created the lockbox to open it, thereby limiting the amount of damage that can be done per person, but this will not solve the problem because the malicious miner can easily collude with anyone else. The fundamental problem, that there is no way to come up with a mechanism for validating the blockchain that does not update itself over time, is either very difficult to solve or likely cannot be solved while staying purely within Bitcoin’s “static lockbox” scripting paradigm.Another approach, one that can solve this problem without excessive difficulty, is more intricate and intrusive. It requires essentially including what is called a “light client” for Bitcoin 1.0 into Bitcoin 2.0. The light client is most easily described as a long-running “contract”, a program on the blockchain with a large amount of internal state that runs every time a transaction gets sent to it, that would accept blocks and verify block headers in exactly the same way that a Bitcoin client on your mobile phone would. This contract would then keep a running list of all block headers in Bitcoin 1.0, and in order to receive one BTC2.0 one would need to submit a cryptographic proof that you made the required transaction in BTC1.0 into the contract, alongside a security deposit of 0.1 BTC2.0.The contract would check that the proof is valid, ends up at a block that is in the contract’s own internal mini-blockchain, and then wait one of two things happened. First, once sixty more Bitcoin 1.0 blocks get added into the contract, it would release one unit of BTC2.0 to the sender plus the security deposit. Alternatively, if someone else submits a cryptographic proof that the transaction is invalid for whatever reason (eg. it spends bitcoins that don’t exist) within that time, then they would receive the security deposit.This would solve the security problem, but has one important flaw: it cannot be done within the Bitcoin protocol as it stands. It is fairly easy to implement in a protocol like Ethereum, because it is specifically designed for contracts, but Bitcoin’s scripting functionality does not allow for the existence of contracts that have internal state, so doing this inside of Bitcoin would require a very substantial change to the Bitcoin 1.0 protocol. Ultimately, the approach taken by Austin Hill and Adam Back may not look exactly like either of these strategies; however, the sheer complexity of the problem shows that there are still many challenges that lie ahead.MiningAnother important question is: how will these side-chains be secured? The standard mechanism for securing a blockchain is mining, but mining requires a mechanism for rewarding miners on that chain. In a side-chain, every unit of the side-chain currency must be backed by a script-lockbox containing a unit of BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain, so there is no simple opportunity to issue side-chain currency units out of nowhere. There are two possibilities for this: demurrage (ie. a percentage-per-year tax on all BTC on the side-chain), and transaction fees. However, both of these provide a fairly low amount of revenue, and so it is not at all certain that plain old independent mining will solve the problem.There are two approaches to get around this issue. One approach is to have the side-chain be secured by proof of stake, using the small revenue from transaction fees to compensate participating stakeholders with an interest rate. However, this approach would be very difficult to implement into a side-chain, because the computations involved in validating proof-of-stake are likely too complex to effectively implement directly on a blockchain. The other approach, and the one promoted by Adam Back and Austin Hill, is called “merge-mining”; essentially, miners include in Bitcoin blocks data from both the Bitcoin block and the Namecoin block, allowing miners to provide security for both chains at the same time using the same computational effort.However, as argued by Bitcoin developer Peter Todd, the concept of merge-mining does have one very important security flaw: unless the majority of Bitcoin miners agree to merge-mine a particular chain, that chain is arguably not secure at all. To understand why, first consider the case of a more traditional altcoin, in our example running SHA256 for simplicity (if the altcoin uses a custom algorithm, then Litecoin miners can pull off the attack instead). If the altcoin has 5 of the hashpower of Bitcoin, then in order to attack the chain via a double-spend at least 5 of the Bitcoin network’s power would need to temporarily redirect itself to mining on the altcoin. This is potentially possible, but is a costly move: while the attack is in place, the Bitcoin miners would lose the revenue from mining on Bitcoin. In the case of a merge-mined side-chain, however, mining on the mainline of a side-chain or attacking it are both cost-free, so there would be no economic disincentive to attacking the alternative chain. This is not a mere conjecture; there have been actual examples of mining pools attacking merge-mined chains in reality.Aside from security, this dependence on merge-mining also exposes another worrying limitation of the side-chains idea: while the spirit of cryptocurrency is arguably that of permissionless innovation, creating a side-chain requires the permission and active assistance of 50 of all Bitcoin mining pool operators. These limitations together suggest that the side-chains protocol, while great for many use cases, will certainly not be ideal for all.The PromiseIf the technical issues around side-chains can be addressed, what is the promise that they bring? Right now, cryptocurrency development can essentially be classified into four quadrants. The first quadrant consists of projects that use the Bitcoin currency and the Bitcoin blockchain – essentially, Bitcoin itself. The second quadrant is protocols that use the Bitcoin blockchain but not the Bitcoin currency; Mastercoin, colored coins and Counterparty are excellent examples of this. The third quadrant uses both an independent currency and an independent blockchain; this contains applications like (to take widely disparate examples) Ripple, Litecoin and NXT. Now, with sidechains the last quadrant has also been filled: using an independent network but using Bitcoin as the underlying currency.It will be interesting to see what applications that niche works best for. For entire new ecosystems, it’s likely not the right approach; it makes little sense for a completely independent network like Ripple or Ethereum to tie its main internal token to Bitcoin financially and have the two be exposed to each other’s price movements. In the case of such major efforts, it also often makes sense to experiment with different monetary policies; Ethereum’s ether has a linear issuance model that constantly releases a certain fixed number of currency units every year, whereas Ripple released all 100 billion units of XRP to the Ripple organization all at once, and the organization is releasing them over time to developers, investors and people participating in distributed computing projects. For a fork that is intended to serve as a major protocol change, like upgrading from SHA256 to SHA3 or in the case of quantum computers from ECDSA to Lamport signatures or NTRU, it definitely makes total sense. For everything in the middle, it’ll be up to a case-by-case basis to figure out.In the case of Ethereum, there is a special consideration to keep in mind: Ethereum is a general-purpose cryptographic consensus platform, not a specific “altcoin”. Hence, one can have many different currencies coexisting on the Ethereum platform as contracts; one can have boring old fixed-supply currencies, currencies with a monetary policy managed by a decentralized autonomous organization, currencies which exist to subsidize scientific research or provide a basic income, and even currencies with a built-in two-way-exchange mechanism to act as side-chains. Thus, Ethereum cannot accurately be pigeonholed into either the side-chains quadrant or the Ripple/Litecoin/NXT quadrant; it exists in both.Indeed, it is very likely that as soon as the Ethereum genesis block launches, there will be side-chains for Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin implemented as contracts within three months. If side chains can be successfully and securely implemented, this means that Ethereum may even become the preferred means for storing BTC, LTC or DOGE using powerful multisignature storage contracts involving features like withdrawal limits. Between contracts on a general-purpose chain, high-performance special-purpose altcoins, quasi-centralized OpenTransactions servers, side-chains and Bitcoin itself, one thing is becoming clear: cryptocurrencies are going to be able to interoperate like never before.",

    "text": "Latin for “Nighttime Sun,” Sol Noctis is the first series of real proof collectible coins denominated in bitcoins. The first coin of the series got the name of the Binary Eagle. It’s a pure silver coin of proof quality with a built-in 0.01 bitcoin (XBT) value that is set to attract coin collectors and bitcoin enthusiasts around the world.The Binary Eagle is a silver collectible coin minted of 1 oz .999 pure silver in proof quality with the face value of .01 BTC. Bitcoin, the world’s first digital currency, was launched in 2009 as a peer-to-peer payment system that allows users to send and receive payment without credit cards or bank accounts. As bitcoin’s popularity has grown and its usage is constantly expanding beyond the limits of a payment system, it was soon spotted by collectors of modern coins.The Binary Eagle was struck by the Mint of Poland, one of the leading manufacturers of coins and collector’s items in the world. The Binary Eagle coin design incorporates complex elements and security features that make it truly unique. Each coin is embellished with a majestic eagle, a symbol of the freedom the bitcoin technology provides.Bitcoin value was attached to the coin by applying a sticker with bitcoin wallet keys printed on it, and protected by a holographic image. A special technique of E-Beam NanogramTM was applied to create a hologram with maximum protection against counterfeit. Thanks to it, four levels of security features are embossed into the holographic foil with a resolution of 550,000 dpi. A Private Key, which is needed to redeem the face value, is located under the coin’s protective holographic layer. It is automatically printed and is not stored by the manufacturing company, which means only the owner of the Sol Noctis coin has access to it and thus can realize the facevalue of the coin at any time. As a result, the world’s first collectible proof quality coin with detachable face value was produced. The total quantity of the coins minted will not exceed 2009 pieces.“We created Sol Noctis to mark the point where two worlds meet: traditional numismatics and a payment system of the future, and so to push the limits of both of them. It’s a thrill to integrate such a unique and universal cryptocurrency into a high quality physical product. The Binary Eagle is the also the first official coin that is manufactured maintaining the highest standards of the reputable Mint,” said Danylo Knysh, general manager of TopWorldCoins GmbH.Binary Eagle coins will be available for retail purchase at selected retailers starting from November/December 2014.

    "text": "In 2014 we saw the release of the first hardware Bitcoin wallets. Now the unicorn is real: offline coins that can be spent, using an Internet-connected and even malware-infected computer, all without risk of losing your money.How is this possible? It’s important to first understand how bitcoins get stolen.To say that someone’s bitcoins are “on her computer” is actually a misleading statement. What is stored on a Bitcoin-owner’s computer is actually the private key that corresponds to her Bitcoin address (the public key). When the owner wants to spend her funds, her wallet software combines her private and public keys to create a signature—the digital equivalent of signing the back of a check. This digital signature unlocks the funds and they’re now spendable.This is why storing your private key in an Internet-connected laptop, desktop or phone—or with an online wallet service—always carries risk. It’s always possible that malicious software (“malware”) could enter your device through the Internet, enabling someone to discover your Bitcoin private key and spend your money.Cold storage savings—that is, sending your bitcoins to a public address whose private key is not stored on any Internet-connected device—provided an answer to this problem. But it was inconvenient. You couldn’t spend from your savings without first importing the private key into Internet-connected software, defeating the whole purpose of cold storage. Could a “hot” wallet (spend-ready) and a secure wallet ever be one-and-the-same? This unicorn—cold storage you could spend from—was what we were all hoping for.Hardware wallets appeared as the white winged creatures, and the most popular among them is the Trezor.The Trezor, which is not Internet-enabled, stores your private key. Using the USB cable provided, you connect it to your computer and create a wallet at MyTrezor.com. The Trezor device then generates a seed of 12, 18 or 24 random words (your choice) on its own small screen, which you write down and store away. These words never touch the Internet and can be used to recover your private key if your Trezor is ever lost, destroyed, or stolen.You can also choose to enable PIN and/or passphrase protection, so that if your device were ever stolen, the thief would also have to know two additional pieces of private information to access your coins.Worried that your computer could be infected with a keylogger (malware that records your keystrokes)? You’re still safe. If you choose to enable PIN protection, MyTrezor wallet will ask for your PIN before a transaction is sent. The 9-digit number pad is only displayed in cleartext (scrambled out of standard order) on your Trezor itself. Only question marks appear on your computer screen, which you click with your cursor.You may be wondering: what if I want multiple private keys because I (duh) want to have more than one Bitcoin address? No problem. The Trezor is a deterministic wallet, which means that an unlimited number of public addresses are recoverable from the same, single seed.The Trezor is the creation of Prague-based SatoshiLabs, which was founded in fall 2013. All the software for the Trezor is open-source and viewable on GitHub, and the device ships for free internationally. At the time of writing, a Trezor costs 0.32 BTC ($119 USD).If you own or plan to own bitcoins, and if you’re worried about computer security (who isn’t?), consider shopping around for hardware wallets. Store your private keys offline while retaining the ability to spend your Bitcoin easily.",

    "title": "Investors have been watching and waiting for the launch of Gemini, the bitcoin exchange launched by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss,",
    "text": "Investors have been watching and waiting for the launch of Gemini, the bitcoin exchange launched by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, since it was first announced on January 23. The wait is over. Customers have been begun receiving instructions for onboarding and will be able to officially begin trading on the Gemini exchange starting Thursday, October 8 at 9:30 a.m. EST. The nine months it took for Gemini to go from announcement to launch is due to a belief in the need to “ask for permission, not forgiveness.” However, on September 23, Gemini Trust Company received approval for its Articles of Organization and was further granted an exemption from the deposit insurance requirements of Section 32 of the Banking Law. Law firm Kaye Scholer’s Corporate partner, Evan Greebel, advised Gemini throughout its formation and launch.Due to its corporate structure as a limited liability trust company (LLTC), it is able to service both individual and institutional customers, which is important because many believe that banks are curious about trading bitcoin.“The reality is that institutions will bring the most amount of capital to the exchange,” Cameron Winklevoss, president of Gemini Trust Company, told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview and demo. “Every major bank in the world has people looking at bitcoin.”The downside of being an LLTC is that the company itself cannot provide FDIC insurance for its accounts. That being said, Gemini revealed at launch that a New York based bank is the depository institution for all US dollars transferred to Gemini. Through this partner, all USD is eligible for FDIC insurance.Four Silos of SuccessIn an interview with Cameron Winklevoss, he revealed that the company operates on four silos that they drive toward for success. The fastest way for a user to lose trust in a company is for security to be insufficient. Because of that, security is the company’s primary objective. They hired Cem Paya, the former security lead at AirBnB, to be the chief security officer at Gemini. Further, all bitcoin is held by Gemini in a cold, geographically dispersed network of servers. When the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, COIN, launches, all of its bitcoin will be held by Gemini.Taking it a step further, though, the company has put in place a rule that prohibits any links in emails. For example, in its “Gemini is open for business!” launch email, there is no link to Gemini. To prevent phishing attempts whereby a hacker gains access to a user’s account, the individual has to manually type in Gemini.com to register.Following security came compliance. Since the company is based in New York, that meant working with the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYFDS). According to Winklevoss, NYDFS seemed open to working with Gemini. Compliance was also required for the remainder of the country. At launch, users in California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont,Washington, D.C., and Wyoming can use Gemini starting on Thursday. The third component of the Winklevoss’ four silos is banking. There have been too many instances where a bank won’t cover a bitcoin company because of the concern about auditing. “It didn’t take a lot of selling to convince the bank to work with us,” Winklevoss said. “They liked the team and the product.” Only after security, compliance and banking were handled did the product become a priority. And if any of the four silos had to suffer, it would be product.“You have to have all four right to succeed, but if you’re missing a little bit on product, it’s not going to be catastrophic,” he explained. “Rather than building a rocket shop in the air, we built it in the hanger, tested it, and tested it again, and then we have liftoff.”In his interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Winklevoss talked at length about the risk tolerance of banks and the simple fact that they hate risk.“It’s better to have the regulatory framework figured out because the risk appetite of banks is conservative. People don’t recognize how important regulation is these institutions. Banks care,” he explained. And because it is the big institutions that are bringing the majority of the capital, it was important to the team to have that regulatory framework squared away. “There is a lot of dark pool trading, because it is easier, that will go on exchange when they are regulated.” Gemini wasn’t the first to market, but Winklevoss said that wasn’t important to him. “Market centers [like Gemini] will build up reputation and credibility with participants over time. A month does not make or break your business,” he explained, referring to other exchanges that had already launched in New York City. Trading on the ExchangeThe exchange opens for trading on Thursday 9:30 a.m. EST, but users can begin the process of signing up today.Part of the registration process is a knowledge-based authorization. The system will attempt to verify a user’s identity through a Social Security number and then questions about that user’s credit. For example, it will ask if they have ever owned a house on a particular street if that appears on the credit report. This is meant to speed up the authorization process for that user.In our demo, Winklevoss stressed the importance that he wanted Gemini to become the favorite of both institutions and individuals.“Early community is certainly very important because they are the most vocal and they are the ones who will touch the product more,” he explained.  The team went with a very clean look, using as much white space as possible. Further, the system was built with visualization engines that enable the user to identify what impact their particular trade will have on the order book. For example, in the image above, if a user decided to purchase 0.631 BTC at a limit of $237.71, the blue portion of the order book would fill in darker where that purchase takes place. This is meant to show what the average price would be for the user.  At launch, it will be free to deposit and withdraw funds from Gemini. However, the company will charge a 25 basis points fee for both buyers and sellers who trade on the exchange. There will also be APIs for individuals who are more interested in programmatically trading to participate. Photo TechCrunch / Flickr",

Magazine founders Mihai Alisie and Vitalik Buterin published their first issue in May, 2012 and later joined forces with Orlando, Florida-based Coin Publishing LLC to produce 22 issues. The magazine is mailed to subscribers worldwide, sold at Barnes & Noble bookstores and published online at www.bitcoinmagazine.com.BTC Media founders Calli S. Bailey and David F. Bailey plan to capitalize on the acquisition by increasing their company’s online news and analysis, among other benefits of the merger.“This purchase and the enhanced resources it brings into our fold make BTC Media the world’s leading Bitcoin media group,” said CEO David Bailey. “Our readers will now have access not only to the same in-depth feature stories they’ve always found in yBitcoin, but also to breaking news about a cryptocurrency world that is growing exponentially. We aim to be the most trusted source for news in this field by offering relevant information to every reader, regardless of their familiarity with Bitcoin.”Tony Gallippi, co-owner of Coin Publishing LLC and executive chairman of BitPay, commented, “The BTC Media publication yBitcoin has played an instrumental role in introducing Bitcoin to the world. We knew this would perfectly fit our effort to spread the Bitcoin story to a larger audience. We’re extremely proud of Bitcoin Magazine’s accomplishments, but know that we’ve only scratched the surface.

    "text": " Coinbase has introduced the first U.S.-issued bitcoin debit card, the Shift Card, in partnership with Shift Payments. The Shift Card is a Visa debit card that currently allows Coinbase users in 24 states to spend bitcoin both online and at physical points of sale at more than 38 million merchants worldwide. “Merchant adoption has come a long way over the past few years, but it’s still difficult for people to make regular purchases with bitcoin,” notes the Coinbase announcement. “Buying gas at a local gas station or groceries at a neighborhood grocery store with bitcoin has not been possible in most cities in the U.S. Thanks to Shift Payments, it’s now possible to use bitcoin to buy gas, groceries, and much more. With the Shift Card, you can now spend bitcoin anywhere in the world that Visa is accepted.”Coinbase users living in the states where the service is available can order a Shift debit card for $10 and link it to a Coinbase wallet. When the Shift debit card is used to make a purchase, the equivalent value of bitcoin (based on the current spot price of bitcoin on Coinbase) is debited from the user’s Coinbase bitcoin wallet. For certain transactions, such as gas purchases and dinner bills, Shift will debit more than the purchase amount, and refund the remainder to the user when the final payment amount is settled.There are no annual fees, no bitcoin-to-dollar conversion fees, and no domestic transaction fees. Coinbase says there are no domestic transaction fees “for a limited time,” which seems to indicate that domestic transaction fees could be added in the future. There is a $2.50 ATM fee and a 3 percent international transaction fee. The daily ATM withdrawal limit is $200, and the default daily spending limit is $1,000.The card isn’t available to users in New York, Florida, and many other states. Coinbase and Shift Payments say that they are working through legal and regulatory matters in the states where the Shift Card is not yet available.Shift Payments wants to integrate all payment options available to a user in one debit card. Users can connect a Shift Card to multiple accounts to seamlessly spend all supported payment means, including digital currencies, with the same card. “The Shift Card works like any debit card today,” notes the Shift website. “Connect your existing accounts and spend Coinbase or Dwolla, immediately and directly, everywhere Visa is accepted.”The Shift card isn’t the first bitcoin debit card, but the availability of a Visa-branded bitcoin debit card from a major bitcoin exchange and wallet operator is likely to represent a quantum leap in the space.“At the end of the day, what we’re trying to do is make bitcoin easy to use,” Coinbase vice president of business development and strategy Adam White, told Wired. “We want to make it easy to buy and sell bitcoin, and we want to make it easy to spend. A mainstream debit card based on bitcoin is a key element.”Of course all U.S. bitcoin users already can spend their bitcoin by converting them to dollars and sending the dollars to their bank accounts, but the process is lengthy and probably overly complex for some users.Therefore, the Shift Card is likely to make Bitcoin much more useful in daily life. Wired notes that existing Coinbase customers are now likely to start spending more of their bitcoin, rather than just speculating, and new customers will be attracted to the digital currency because they can more easily spend it. Then, merchants will be more motivated to start accepting bitcoin, which could start a runaway feedback loop that will boost the Bitcoin ecosystem. ",

    "text": "The rising trend of bitcoin and substantial growth of investments in the digital currency space has increased the awareness of bitcoin across major cities in the United States. Since early 2015, an escalating number of mainstream media outlets, international government agencies and law enforcement agencies have exclusively featured bitcoin in various publications and reports.Such coverage brought bitcoin one step closer to mainstream awareness and adoption, as more people began to understand and notice bitcoin as both an alternative currency and an innovative financial network. Seeking to explore the awareness of the digital currency in the country’s largest cities, including Chicago, business strategist and consultant Tal Newhart and his small team of researchers conducted a social experiment in the suburbs of the city. Newhart’s experiment was divided into two main phases: During the first part of the experiment, Newhart’s team wore a t-shirt with a QR code embedded at the back of the clothing which led to a bitcoin address for a donation to Bitcoin research. In a few days, the short-term campaign generated about $68 in donations. Newhart then used the same bitcoin address and QR code to see if anyone would try to steal the money generated from the Bitcoin research campaign in the streets of Chicago. During the second phase of the experiment, Newhart’s team printed a QR code of the private key corresponding to the bitcoin address and included the word “SHA-256” on the bottom of the shirt, as a reference to the hashing algorithm used for bitcoin. In less than five minutes of wearing the shirt in the suburbs of Chicago, Newhart received an automated text notification that the bitcoin address used for Bitcoin research campaign was emptied. Some individual used a mobile phone to import the private key printed on Newhart’s shirt and used it to transfer the funds to a personal account. \"While the first part of our experiment showed that people can be generous, phase two proved that Bitcoin thieves can be lurking anywhere,\" said Newhart. Newhart and his team then devised this experiment to explore the vulnerability of bitcoin wallets and the awareness of the digital currency. \"A recruiting client, the CEO of a financial services company, had previously had some personal bitcoins stolen when he left his private key in plain view in the back seat of his Mercedes when he had it valet parked. We devised this experiment to see if this was a one-in-a-million event,\" Newhart said. Based on the results of the experiment, Newhart advices all bitcoin users to keep private keys secure and stored in an encrypted format. ",

    "title": "As Mark Karpeles was being arrested on August 1, 2015, his former employee Ashley Barr, who operated under the name",
    "text": "As Mark Karpeles was being arrested on August 1, 2015, his former employee Ashley Barr, who operated under the name “Adam Turner,” took to Reddit to answer questions about his time at Mt.Gox.In his introduction, Barr wrote, “I was hired by Mark [Karpeles] in June 2011 to help him handle the crazy inbox at Mt.Gox during bitcoin’s initial rally. In January 2012 I was asked to become Mt.Gox’s CEO, a process which led to my dismissal in May 2012. My statement along with other ex-employees have led the Tokyo Metro Police’s arrest on embezzlement and ‘illegal manipulation of accounting.’“We plan to eat pizza in front of Mark while he is in prison…”Barr talked openly about the work culture at Mt.Gox while he was there and about Karpeles in particular.Barr wrote, “All in all, I felt Mt.Gox was [a role-playing game] to Mark, as he didn’t quite grasp the reality that the money being in deposited into his bank account meant more to other people than just numbers on his screen.”In the post, Barr took the opportunity to clarify what his role was during his time at Mt.Gox. He also wrote at length about what he knew of the company’s state of affairs. He explained that Karpeles had wanted Barr to take over as CEO, a position Barr declined when he realized that he couldn’t get access to the information necessary to paint a clear picture of the company’s financial situation.“Basically, after Mark asked me to be CEO, I tried my best at due-diligence. I asked Mark to show me the financials of the company. He wouldn’t, or feigned that he would do it later, all while pressuring me to take the role.”Barr asserted that his “due diligence” unearthed discrepancies in the company’s financials.“I confronted Mark about it, told him I couldn’t take the role if he couldn’t explain this gross incompetence in spending (he was also asking employees other than myself to find investors…something impossible without knowing the financial status of the company).”Around the same time, we learned that Mark only had one bank account, shared with Mt.Gox’s customer deposits. That was the nail in the coffin.”Barr went on to describe Karpeles’s response to being confronted with allegations of financial wrongdoing:“…his answer was simply: ‘My grandmother lives in a castle in Switzerland.’ That was it. That was all, we couldn’t get him to explain it. He just ignored the rest of our inquiries. It. was. insane.”Barr went on to make the stunning assertion that Mt.Gox’s only bank account, the one that held customer deposits, was actually Karpeles’s own personal account.Barr also revealed his strong belief that Mt.Gox had no cold storage for any funds stored on the exchange.“[Karpeles] said there were many cold-wallets, what I witnessed was one hot wallet…All I know is that BTC was sitting there when Mark logged in. How he would have moved it from cold storage into a single wallet on a remote-desktop, I have no idea… it’s possible, but I don’t know how to prove it.”Furthermore, Barr said that Karpeles was the only one with the keys to any of the wallets.“Mark said that if he died there would be hints that one of his best friends could follow to find and unlock the cold-wallets. When I asked said friend, he said he had no idea what Mark was talking about.”Regarding the missing 200,000 BTC that were lost and then mysteriously recovered by Karpeles, Barr said, “When I read the news, I was surprised to hear that 200,000 coins were recovered. My first thought was… of course… [expletive]. How is that even [expletive] possible… I guess, to be more specific. I mean, even in usual terms, not knowing if my bank account has $8000 vs $2000 dollars is pretty [expletive] significant…Sorry, I dunno what to conclude but it feels like a lie, or gross ineptitude… either way it’s really, very, upsetting.”However, as for whether or not he thinks that Karpeles actually committed robbery, Barr was non-committal.“I think gross incompetence happened, and Mark tried to cover it up. I don’t believe he is outright malicious, but certainly ignorantly-malicious. If it’s an A) or B) question, I believe he lost them [the missing bitcoins], but considering other s*** I’ve seen… I really can’t be certain.”On a personal level, Barr’s opinion of his former employer was conflicted.“[Karpeles] had (has) the ego of someone wanting to prove themselves, some anti-social behaviors, some social behaviors, and everything in between. He’s still a mystery to me, and absolutely unpredictable.When asked if he wanted authorities to “throw the book” at Karpeles, Barr’s response was similarly measured.“My honestly feeling is I liked Mark, as just… a geek. I’m a geek, I get other geeks. We’re all wired differently but similarly and I enjoyed that about him. I think most others had the same experience, and I think it reflects in his media personality (harmless, but awkward and untrustworthy)…. He’s not evil, just he justifies the things he thinks [he needs] to do to preserve whatever image he has for himself.”",

    "text": "One of the main issues that has slowed the adoption of Bitcoin as a currency and payment system has been the complexity of Bitcoin addresses.The blockchain lacks the human-friendly names normally found with websites and email addresses, which can make sending payments a rather cumbersome process. Netki wants to help people move away from confusing Bitcoin addresses, such as 15eA82FZLogpSb8nkQ5h5qaF3QNEwSeyCm, toward human-readable names such as kyletorpey.tip.me.Any bitcoin user would be able to send bitcoin to anyone else as easily as a Gmail user can send an email to someone using a web browser.How Does it Work?Netki uses a combination of the Namecoin blockchain and Secure DNS (DNSSEC) to take care of name storage and mapping between a name and an address.“Your base records reside in the Namecoin blockchain proving ownership, and allowing for full, censor-proof control,” Netki CEO Justin Newton explained via email. “The actual wallet name-to-address lookups occur on standard DNS records secured and authenticated using DNSSEC.“This combination of decentralized and distributed [solutions] provides the control and ownership of the blockchain along with the privacy of keeping your name to address mapping off of a public ledger,” Newton said.The Netki CEO also explained that wallet providers will be able to hand out names in a manner similar to how email addresses are handed out to Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo and other online mail providers. He specifically mentioned ChangeTip’s use of the tip.me domain as an example of this feature.Newton was also able to share his thoughts on the differences between Netki and another Bitcoin name system, OneName:“We believe that a lot of what OneName is doing is really fantastic. There is a need for a decentralized way to validate your social identity, and their roadmap feature of using signatures instead of passwords for logins is excellent and long overdue. We do believe, however, that tying your identity to your wallet address on a public ledger negates the possibility of privacy on the blockchain. For us, making it easy to share your address with anyone without having to publish it to everyone is one of the keys to our service. We’d love to see OneName support Wallet Names where they currently support bitcoin addresses.”A Problem for Privacy?The obvious question when talking about name-mapping systems for digital currencies is what it will mean for user privacy. After all, privacy and anonymity are still desirable features for a large number of bitcoin users.Newton said the protection of privacy was also a concern for Netki, but he added that the use of HD wallets “allows the return of a unique address every time.”Netki also supports Payment Requests, which are sometimes referred to as the “SSL for wallet addresses.”Newton explained that the integration of Payment Requests will allow users to see a green lock next to an address in the “To” field of a Bitcoin wallet. That lock helps users confirm that they’re sending bitcoin to the correct individual, organization, or company. This process is similar to the green lock found next to website URLs that have been secured via SSL and an HTTPS connection.“The combination of HD Wallets and Payment Requests with Wallet Names increases the privacy and security of sending bitcoin, while at the same time making it more user friendly and reassuring to end users,” Newton said.An example of this system can be seen in the video below:In addition to ChangeTip, Netki has also partnered with Gem, Snapcard, Purse.io, ShapeShift, BitQuick, Coinprism, Fold App, and many other companies in the Bitcoin space.",

    "text": "Xapo CEO Wences Casares has been one of Bitcoin’s strongest supporters since 2011, but not many people have heard the story of how he originally got into this new form of digital money. The Argentinian-born entrepreneur has been able to create one of the most well-capitalized companies in the space, and he was able to mystify the likes of Dick Costolo, Marc Andreessen, Reid Hoffman and other Silicon Valley giants by transferring roughly $250,000 worth of bitcoin between multiple smartphones within a matter of minutes. But what led Casares to Bitcoin in the first place?Trying to Send Money to Friends in ArgentinaUnlike many of the Bitcoin proponents who talk about how the digital money is going to change the world without having their own, personal need for it, Casares came across Bitcoin while attempting to send money to childhood friends in Argentina. The Xapo CEO explained the process of finding out about Bitcoin on arecent episode of EconTalk:“I first learned about Bitcoin in 2011. I live in California, in Palo Alto, and a group of childhood friends from Argentina were doing a project where we needed to send money to that project. And I couldn’t send money from California to Argentina, so I was looking to see if my sister, who’s there, could give the friends some money and I could pay her later. And one of my friends – who’s not tech savvy or financially savvy – said, ‘Hey, why don’t you use Bitcoin?’”Giving Bitcoin a ChanceAlthough Casares admits he was skeptical at first, he decided to give Bitcoin a chance as a new international payment mechanism. He described the entire process of using Bitcoin to send money to his friends in Argentina in his recent EconTalk interview:“So, I was curious and I looked [it] up online, and, I think on Craigslist, I found someone who was willing to meet with me at the cafe in Palo Alto and gave me some bitcoin and I gave them the cash. Then, I just got the bitcoin on my cell phone and I sent them to my friend in Argentina and the next day he has . . . [Argentine] pesos. And I just couldn’t believe what happened.”Many bitcoiners remember the first time they used the digital money because it is a strange feeling to have actual value stored on an electronic device as a string of bits.“I felt like I was witnessing the beginning of the Internet. It was that kind of fascination,” Casares said.Abra is the Mainstream Version of Casares’s 2011 ExperienceWences Casares’s story has been repeated many more times all over the world since 2011, and there is now an app that captures the essence of that experience in a user-friendly manner. Abra allows users to send digital cash to anyone else in the world, and that digital cash can then be transferred to local currency via a peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer.Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of the app is that it also locks the value of the digital cash to U.S. dollars, which means users don’t need to worry about bitcoin’s price volatility for the duration of the transfer. Abra is powered by smart contracts built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.Abra is just now coming to market, but Casares already experienced this new phenomenon four years ago. As time goes by, we will continue to see more apps developed that were first thought of in the early days of IRC chatrooms and bitcointalk.org threads.Photo Christopher Michel / Flickr",

    "text": "The block-size limit dispute, at its heart, represents a trade-off between efficiency and security. Bigger blocks allow for more transactions on the Bitcoin network but could reduce mining power utilization and lead to centralization. Engulfed in sometimes heated debates, several developers have submitted proposals to strike the right balance between the two and reach community consensus – but so far to no avail. A group of Cornell University researchers, meanwhile, took an entirely different approach. Instead of attempting to strike the right balance, post-doctoral associate Ittay Eyal, doctoral student Adem Efe Gencer, computer science professor Emin Gün Sirer and research scientist Robbert Van Renesse, proposed Bitcoin NG, a radical redesign of the Bitcoin architecture meant to solve the block size trade-off entirely. On key blocksCurrently, Bitcoin miners include two main types of data in blocks: a proof of work which allows the network to determine the longest chain, and a number of transactions to be selected by the miner. As its main differentiator, Bitcoin NG splits these two functions by creating two separate types of blocks: key blocks and microblocks, both of which are still part of the same chain. Key blocks include the proof of work, a reference to the previous block, and the coinbase transaction (mining reward) – but none of the other transactions. In Bitcoin NG's current design, and much like “normal” Bitcoin blocks, key blocks are found every 10 minutes on average. And, also like “normal” Bitcoin blocks, the amount of hashing power used to find the block determines the longest chain. In other words, it determines which blockchain is the real one. To explain the benefits of using key blocks, Eyal told Bitcoin Magazine: Since key blocks don't include any transactions, they require very little data to be transmitted over the network. This results in faster block propagation, and, therefore, in fewer pruned blocks ['orphans']. As such, less mining power is wasted, and the incentive to centralize mining is reduced.\"On microblocksApart from the proof of work, a reference to the previous block, and the coinbase transaction, a miner includes one more type of data in a key block: his own public key. Subsequently, the corresponding private key is required to sign the other type of blocks: microblocks. As opposed to key blocks, microblocks do not include any proof of work, but merely store transactions. These microblocks are created much more often: on average once every 10 seconds in Bitcoin NG's initial design. As such, the miner of a key block is essentially in charge of confirming transactions on the network until a new key block is found. On poison transactionsThere is one problem. The fact that microblocks are not secured by proof of work, means a miner (the key block signer) could easily double spend a transaction; he can simply sign multiple microblocks with contradicting transactions to different entities at the same time. Therefore, Bitcoin NG uses so-called “poison transactions.” If the network notices a double spend, a poison transaction is created, which destroys the revenue – the mining reward and fees – of the double spending miner retroactively. As such, miners are incentivized to remain honest. Transactions included in a microblock on the Bitcoin NG blockchain would be much more reliable than unconfirmed transactions on the current Bitcoin blockchain,” says Eyal. “But microblocks would not offer the same level of security as key blocks. Only key blocks would offer a similar level of security as blocks on the current blockchain do, meaning it would still be wise to wait for several confirmations when the value of a transaction is significant.”RadicalCompared to alternative proposals circulating that address the scaling issue. Bitcoin NG is probably the most radical redesign of the Bitcoin protocol as we know it today. By basically flipping the current process of Bitcoin mining on its head, the Cornell research team has proposed an alternative that is completely incompatible with the existing consensus rules. Whether Bitcoin NG actually has any type of future, therefore, remains to be seen. There are several ways where this could go,” Eyal explained. “We could reach a consensus among the Bitcoin community to change the way the blockchain works, and implement Bitcoin NG to be the new Bitcoin. Or, if someone is inclined to implement all the technical differences, Bitcoin NG could become an altcoin. Personally, I'm interested in the technology and the science behind it, as a research project. I think this is a better way to do a blockchain.”For more information on Bitcoin NG, see Eyal and Sirer’s blog post on Hacking, Distributed.",

    "text": "BitGold Inc. has announced the public launch of the BitGold platform, a software service that connects gold storage with payment networks, resulting in a banking-like platform for gold.The announcement refers to the BitGold platform as a “new global operating system for gold.” In fact, BitGold is a digital payments platform that connects gold stored in real-world vaults with online payments.Though the BitGold press release emphasizes that BitGold is not a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, there are similarities. In particular, the BitGold platform allows for the quick settlement of gold trades so that a users’ gold is easily acquired and accessible across various payment networks such as SWIFT, Visa, MasterCard, Interac, SEPA, UnionPay, Discover, American Express and others – including bitcoin.BitGold payment fees are higher than those of bitcoin payment processors but lower than most alternatives.Thus, BitGold provides some of the advantages of bitcoin payments – faster and cheaper digital cross-border transactions – combined with the advantages of gold as a store of value, and can be seen as a Bitcoin-like system for gold. BitGold seems likely to become an appealing option for those who trust gold more than bitcoin.The BitGold website states that the company views gold as a security switch for a world that is increasingly digital, and implemented security features to protect users’ accounts and identities, such as secure vaults, full insurance with Lloyds of London against theft or loss, military-grade encryption (RSA 4096 and AES256) to secure users’ accounts and personal information, and multi-factor authentication measures.BitGold claims that it offers the most competitive rates in the industry for buying and selling gold, and is the only platform that allows users to spend from their gold account.“At BitGold we have a mission to democratize global access to gold for stable savings, and to make gold useful in micro-transactions using the Internet or mobile phones,” said co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer, Josh Crumb. “No matter where you live in the world, gold has held value over time relative to costs like food and energy that we require as humans, making it one the most important savings tools for most of the human population. We believe that by broadening access to a commodity-money that holds value we can help combat the rise in wealth inequality and the short-termism.”BitGold is a Canadian corporation with offices in Toronto and Milan and a network of secure vaults for gold storage, operated in partnership with The Brink’s Company, a global leader in security-related services for banks, retailers and a variety of other commercial and governmental customers. Users can choose where in the world they want their gold physically stored. The company’s financial statements are audited by PriceWaterhouse Coopers.BitGold accounts are free and can be opened in minutes. New users are provided with a secure vault account to purchase and hold gold, the ability to make and receive instant gold payments, and a debit card for spending gold at traditional points of sale. Customers can fund their accounts with local-currency by using a network of ATMs. BitGold will not initially be available to U.S. residents, and will be unavailable to residents of sanctioned countries.“We are excited to unveil the BitGold platform, an architecture and technology that’s taken years of careful planning and execution, which now allows users to seamlessly use gold again as a store of value and medium for payments,” said co-founder and CEO Roy Sebag.“As a global asset, gold is recognized in nearly every culture as a long-term protector of value, but has been a poor medium of exchange compared to the advances in money technology,” Sebag said. “We felt that gold needed the modernization and mobilization that’s now happening in the global payments revolution. We have built a financial services platform that is as close to being counterparty-free as possible, enabling economic transactions within the existing global financial system to be settled in full reserved gold bullion.”The term “BitGold” may be confusing because it is also used by Bitreserve. Previously, it was used by cryptographer Nick Szabo for the cryptocurrency that he proposed before Bitcoin.Old Vault Door / CC BY 2.0",

    "text": "Leading bitcoin security platform and multi-signature / P2SH (pay-to-script hash) bitcoin wallet provider BitGo has transacted more than $1 billion worth of bitcoin transactions in a single quarter.“BitGo was the first to pioneer the secure, multi-signature wallet platform for bitcoin,” said BitGo CEO and co-founder Mike Belshe. “Security is never a finished feature, so we’re continually raising the bar. As we reach this billion-dollar milestone, we’re happy know so many customers are seeing the value of our solution.”The BitGo wallet platform and API have not experienced a single breach or theft of bitcoin since its launch in 2013. The company has been focused on creating the world’s most secure bitcoin wallet, prioritizing security and multi-signature solutions.The platform’s API services and products designed for both developers and institutions enable users to create hundreds of thousands of addresses, with a real-time view of digital asset transactions and settlements.“For the sake of accuracy, our metrics do not count change address outputs. As an example, if a user sends someone $13 from a wallet with $17 in it, we only count the $13 transaction and not the transfer of $4 back into the wallet.” said Regina Scolaro, Director of Marketing for BitGo. “We have chosen to use this methodology because we believe that in order to get a true sense of activity within the Bitcoin space, this should be the standard measurement.”Furthermore, the BitGo platform has secured its bitcoin wallets with multi-signature pay-to-script hash technology, also known as P2SH, allowing users to send bitcoin to addresses secured in various unusual ways without knowing much about the security details, thus creating completely unique transactions and settlements.",

    "text": "Australian Bitcoin payment company Living Room of Satoshi announced that its new “Pay Anyone” service allows Australians to pay bitcoin directly to any bank account.“Bitcoin users can now pay their friends, tradesmen and anyone else; even if the recipient has no knowledge about bitcoin,” says Living Room of Satoshi CEO Daniel Alexiuc. “This is a vital piece of payment infrastructure that is now available to all Australians.”Living Room of Satoshi is a payments company that enables payment of any bill that uses the BPAY system using bitcoin. Customers can spend bitcoin to pay phone bills, electricity bills, school fees, credit cards, tax payments and more. Founded in 2014, the company has processed more than $500,000 of Australian bills using bitcoin.BPAY is an electronic bill payment system in Australia which enables payments to be made through a financial institution's online, mobile or telephone banking facility to organizations which are registered BPAY billers. BPAY is a registered trading name of BPAY Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardlink Services Limited. Cardlink is owned equally by the four major Australian banks: Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Limited and Westpac Banking Corporation.“Today BPAY offers fast, secure and convenient bill payments through over 150 Australian financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, covering over 95 percent of the consumer banking market,” states the BPAY website. “That means most Australians can now enjoy the convenience of paying their bills with BPAY. And with BPAY offered on over 44,000 bills (via 22,000 billers and more than 22,000 Sub Billers), these businesses cover a spectrum of industries with over 354 industry (ANZSIC) codes represented in the BPAY biller file. We now accept more payments than ever. In fact, each month we help process more than 30 million bills worth more than $24 billion – with around 92 percent of these paid through a customer’s online or mobile bank.”“All of our customers find Bitcoin a fast, secure and convenient way to pay bills,” said Alexiuc in a recent interview published on the Australian edition of CIO Magazine. “You can see from our graphs page that our customers are paying all sorts of everyday bills, from toll road charges to tax bills. Many use Living Room of Satoshi to pay off their credit cards with Bitcoin, which opens up an even greater range of places to spend bitcoin.”He added that, in Australia, by far the biggest impediment to the adoption of Bitcoin is the recent GST (Goods and Service Tax) ruling. According to Alexiuc, Bitcoin is a nascent and unprecedented technology that regulators are still struggling to comprehend, and therefore the software developers in Australia need to continue to innovate and demonstrate the utility of bitcoin, which will in turn shape regulation. It needs to be easy for businesses to transact completely in bitcoin – to sell products in bitcoin, pay their staff in bitcoin and purchase supplies in bitcoin.",

    "text": "A Princeton University free online course on “Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies” will be offered by Coursera beginning September 4, 2015.Coursera is an online education platform for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which partners with top universities and organizations worldwide, to offer courses online for anyone to take for free. MOOCs give anyone, anywhere, the possibility to acquire a world-class education. Courses include video lectures, exercises and online interaction with teachers and other students. Some courses offer certification as well.The Princeton Bitcoin course will last six weeks, with the last lecture on November 1, 2015, but students also will be able to follow the video lectures after that date. That’s part of the appeal of MOOCs –students who prefer to learn at their own pace can follow the video lectures asynchronously, when they want, while students who can adapt their schedules to a course’s official timetable have the added benefit of semi-synchronous interaction with the instructors.“To really understand what is special about Bitcoin, we need to understand how it works at a technical level,” notes the Coursera website. “After this course, you’ll know everything you need to be able to separate fact from fiction when reading claims about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. You’ll have the conceptual foundations you need to engineer secure software that interacts with the Bitcoin network. And you’ll be able to integrate ideas from Bitcoin in your own projects.”The Freedom to Tinker website, hosted by Princeton’s Center for Information Technology Policy, notes that a preliminary version of the Princeton Bitcoin course has been publicly available since January, with 11 video lectures, lecture notes and exercises, on the Piazza online educational platform. The new Coursera version includes new lectures, embedded quizzes to test the students’ understanding, and a wider community of students to discuss the lectures with. About 15,000 students already have signed up, and the enrollment is growing fast.The instructors – Arvind Narayanan, Joseph Bonneau, and Edward Felten from Princeton University, and Andrew Miller from The University of Maryland – are completing the course’s textbook, which will be published by Princeton University Press. The draft book chapters will remain freely available online after the publication of the book, but the instructors recommend buying the book.The Princeton course is clearly aimed at a technically oriented, hands-on audience of programmers and computer scientists.“How does our textbook (and course) differ from other books on Bitcoin?” wroteNarayanan in the first Princeton announcement in January. “It’s simple: this is unabashedly a computer science text and course. We connect the ideas we discuss to the rest of computer science, and separate fundamental concepts from implementation details. The hype in the Bitcoin community has sometimes gotten ahead of the technology, and we think that for cryptocurrencies to truly realize their potential, entrepreneurs must go back to the basics, rigorously understand the technology and build on it.”The course will be very useful to Bitcoin entrepreneurs and job seekers wishing to enter the very hot digital currency sector. In fact, banks and Wall Street companies are rushing to enter the Bitcoin space and fishing for top talent in Bitcoin waters, and online Bitcoin job ads are surging to record highs.In related news, Stanford University is offering a Cyber Security Graduate Certificate focused on computer systems security, including attack protection and prevention, very important skills in the Bitcoin space. The Stanford course is more intense than the Princeton course and is not free.",

    "text": "The increase in bitcoin ransom demands and hacking incidents have alerted international law enforcement agencies and governments about the involvement of bitcoin in illegal activities. This week, bitcoin startup SABR has raised $1 million USD in an early seed funding round for its blockchain monitoring and identification system.As a consultation-like service, SABR will work with law enforcement agencies to track down bitcoin transactions, how they’re being spent and who owns them. The company stated that its patented technology, data and partnerships enable it to fully track down information about a single or a series of transactions.“SABR integrates data from multiple blockchains, as well as other public and proprietary sources,” the SABR team explained. “SABR’s unique position and partnerships within the network underlying the decentralized digital currency ecosystem provides access and insight otherwise inaccessible.”The team added that following bitcoin transactions is not an efficient method to track down payments, as bitcoin creates a “blind spot.” SABR claimed that its technology could have found the Dread Pirate Roberts, the administrator of the Silk Road, in a few days, instead of the years of covert investigations by the U.S. Govenment.According to Venturebeat, SABR has already begun to attract the attention of the “U.S. Department of Justice, the White House, and other federal agencies.”All of SABR’s clients, individuals or organizations will be assigned SABR engineers and experienced data analysts and develop a close working relationship to ensure that its clients are efficiently using the SABR software, according to the company.",

    "text": "In May, Bitcoin Magazinereported that blockchain-based Governance 2.0 initiative Bitnation is developing a collaborative platform for DIY Governance based on the blockchain.“Bitnation is a Governance 2.0 Operating System, designed to disrupt the nation-state oligopoly through offering more convenient, secure and cost-efficient governance services,” said Bitnation founder and CEO Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof. Bitnation is one of several emerging initiatives to empower connected global citizens with a growing range of options to bypass legacy governance systems based on nation states. The e-Residency program launched by the government of Estonia is another such initiative. The program offers anyone, anywhere, a digital identity issued by the Estonian government and the possibility to start and operate a business online under Estonian regulations. The foreigners who become e-residents of Estonia are not automatically entitled to physical residency in the small Baltic state, but they can base their online financial life there. Estonia, a country at the forefront of modern e-government, has been offering efficient online services to its citizens for more than a decade. “By offering e-residents the same services, Estonia is proudly pioneering the idea of a country without borders,” proudly states the e-residency website. In particular, e-residents can digitally sign, verify and encrypt documents and contracts, establish an Estonian company online in 24 hours with a physical address in Estonia provided by an external service, and administer the company from anywhere in the world. Currently, establishing an Estonian bank account for the company requires one in-person meeting at one of the banks that recognize e-resident smart ID cards – currently LHV, Swedbank and SEB – but once the account is established e-residents can manage e-banking and remote money transfers from anywhere in the world. An appealing feature of e-residency for entrepreneurs is that, in Estonia, company income is not taxed. Therefore, compliance is simplified and all income is available for re-investment. However, since e-residency doesn’t imply tax residency, e-residents are supposed to pay taxes at home for the money that they take out of the company. Now, the Estonian government is partnering with Bitnation to offer a public notary service to Estonian e-residents based on blockchain technology. “Via the international Bitnation Public Notary, e-residents, regardless of where they live or do business, will be able to notarize their marriages, birth certificates, business contracts, and much more on the blockchain,” states a joint press release. \"I'm delighted to work with Estonia's e-residency program to set a standard practice of competition of governance services on a global market, and to enable others to exercise self-determination and follow Bitnation's path to sovereignty,” said Tarkowski Tempelhof in the press release. “The Republic of Estonia is on the forefront of innovation when it comes to e-governance,” Tarkowski Tempelhof told Bitcoin Magazine. “They’re mostly young and open-minded, eager to test new technologies to improve their services. Additionally, their processes are quite streamlined, which is original for being a government, and needless to say, very refreshing.” If a couple gets married on the public notary, it doesn’t mean they get married in the jurisdiction of Estonia, or in any other nation state jurisdiction, notes the press release. Instead, they get married in the “blockchain jurisdiction.” International Business Timesnotes that, besides marriages, blockchain technology can provides a worldwide legally binding proof of existence and integrity of contractual agreements for things such as banking, incorporating companies quickly and cheaply and generally empowering entrepreneurs and citizens around the world. \"In Estonia we believe that people should be able to freely choose their digital/public services best fit to them, regardless of the geographical area where they were arbitrarily born,” said e-Residency Program Director Kaspar Korjus. “We're truly living in exciting times when nation states and virtual nations compete and collaborate with each other on an international market, to provide better governance services.\" In fact, the importance and potential impact of the Estonian government’s move shouldn’t be underestimated. Here we have the government of a nation state, a full member of the European Union, acknowledging a virtual nation as a legitimate partner for the development and gradual implementation of next-generation governance services. “My aim is to see a world where hundreds of thousands or millions of governance service providers in a free global market competing through offering better services at a better value, rather than through the use of force within arbitrary lines in the sand,” Tarkowski Tempelhof told Bitcoin Magazine. “To that end, seeing nation state governments starting to provide governance services on a free global market as well, like The Republic of Estonia, is encouraging, and a step in the right direction. Now we need more nation state governments, as well as open source protocols joining the global market.” Tarkowski Tempelhof added that, realistically, it’s more likely that small nations will adopt the technology in the short term. “Countries and city states that come to mind are Singapore, Lichtenstein, Andorra, etc.,” she said. “We’re also likely to see nations in the developing world leapfrogging in terms of governance technologies.” Photo Steve Jurvetson / Flickr(CC)",

    "text": "Barry Silbert, Founder of the recently acquired SecondMarket, announced at Money20/20 that the Digital Currency Group had raised its round of capital. Digital Currency Group, otherwise known as DCG, was formed when Genesis Global Trading—a bitcoin OTC trading firm—and Grayscale Investments—a digital currency asset management firm that manages Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC)—were combined into one entity. Along with these two companies, Mr. Silbert also combined his diverse portfolio of seed investment in the bitcoin and blockchain space. Some of his early investments include BitPay, Coinbase, itBit, and Xapo. “Our companies have raised over 70 of venture capital that has been invested in the space if you don’t count the miners,” Silbert said at Money 20/20. Bain Capital Ventures, Canadian Imperial Bank of Comerce (CIBC), CME Ventures, FirstMark Capital, MasterCard, New York Life, Novel TMT, Oak HC/FT, RRE Ventures, Solon Mack Capital, and Transamerica Ventures are all new investors in DCG. “I wanted to work with firms who have a long-term perspective, and were willing to explore with us and invest not only money, but real organizational and intellectual capital into building businesses and partnerships that will enable us to unleash value in new, unprecedented ways,” Silbert said in a statement. DCG is being launched a holding company rather than an investment fund. Silbert believes that this gives the company the necessary flexibility and diversification. “Being structured as a company, versus a fund, allows us to evolve with the industry given our permanent capital base and flexible mandate,” Silbert said in the statement. “It is our view that broad exposure with the optionality to concentrate our focus is a winning strategy.”Jacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business and bitcoin.

    "text": "Writing on Quintessence, the financial magazine of BNP Paribas, financial securities research analyst Johann Palychata analyzes the possible impact and future implications of the blockchain for securities markets. He believes that Bitcoin is really an innovation and a disruptive open-source technology for the financial world.“Its core is the first successful attempt for a secure and decentralized register,” says Palychata. “It should be considered as an invention like the steam or combustion engine. ”BNP Paribas, a French bank headquartered in Paris that was formed through the merger of Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Paribas in 2000, is one of the largest banks in the world. Based on 2012 information BNP Paribas was ranked as the third-largest bank in the world, as measured by total assets, by Bloomberg andForbes.Though Palychata’s opinions shouldn’t be interpreted as an official position statement from the bank, publication in the official BNP Paribas magazine lends them a certain official aura.Palychata considers two possible scenarios for blockchain-based securities markets.“The first scenario creates a total disruption. In its purest form, a distributed blockchain system allows all market participants direct access to the DSD (Decentralised Securities Depositary), to the exchange and to the post-trade infrastructure (clearing and settlement),” he writes. “If this setup develops then existing industry players might be redundant.”It’s surprising that a representative of a major bank even considers the possibility of this scenario, which would be a nightmare for the financial establishment. However, Palychata continues, “given the challenge of keeping the private key of the account safe, it is possible that investors will entrust an authority to safe-keep the private keys. It is also possible that custodians will be responsible for the application layer over the blockchain or that they will launch their own network.“The second scenario is an integration within the post-trade ecosystem,” he says. “The distributed ledger might only be the next generation of IT infrastructure. In this scenario custodians or settlement infrastructures might use the blockchain to record the ownership and trades between themselves; however, end investors will still need to use a custodian to have access to the market.”It appears that this second scenario is becoming closer with the recent initiatives of companies such as Nasdaq and Overstock. Nasdaq partnered with San Francisco-based bitcoin API startup Chain to implement blockchain technology in its Nasdaq Private Market. And Overstock became the first company to offer qualified buyers the option of purchasing corporate bonds that will trade using Bitcoin’s blockchain protocol.“The ledger will only be accessible to authorized market participants,” Palychata continues, exploring the second scenario. “Existing actors will remain in charge in this scenario. However, their level of service could change and they may deploy new services that they could not in the past because the investments required were a huge barrier to entry.”Previously in November, Palychata published an article arguing that bitcoin and other digital currencies could shake up traditional banking and financial services.PYMNTSnoted that Palychata’s article, which publicly suggested that “the development of an alternative to the current banking system is under way,” was remarkable because it came from one of the world’s largest banks.Photojyhem / Flickr ",

    "text": " In what has become a staple of the Inside Bitcoins conferences, leading Bitcoin experts will be judging the demos of five companies from South Korea in this year’s Startup Competition. The event takes place at 3 p.m. Korea Standard Time on December 10. The companies taking part are Bitholla, KoreanBuddy, WageCan, Epsilon Technologies and Coin Trade. The judges are Simon Dixon, Andrew “Flip” Filipowski, Hans Lombardo and Roger Ver. As a whole, the South Korean bitcoin ecosystem is relatively small when compared to nearby countries such as China and Hong Kong. “Bitcoin exchange in South Korea is present but is insufficient, bid/ask is very small in quantity yet to deal with large volumes,” said Mike Hwang, CMO of Coin Trade, one of the presenting companies, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “Coin Trade has [a] plan to launch the global Bitcoin exchange platform service from this January 2016,” Hwang explained. Like many other wallet/exchange providers, Coin Trade is attempting to create an onramp for those who have yet to own bitcoin, plus provide them with the ability to store their bitcoin in a secure wallet and trade it as they desire. “In South Korea, there are two early movers that dominate the ecosystem, and they are Korbit and Coinplug,” Paul Bugge, co-founder of Bitholla, told Bitcoin Magazine. “Korbit is the most-used exchange, while Coinplug is providing multiple services such as Bitcoin ATMs and selling bitcoin through retail convenience stores. Aside from these two tech companies, the new batch of companies are small pre-seed startups like ourselves.”Bugge explained that Bitholla is a social networking platform that first launched back in July 2015. “Since that time we have focused more on continued development of the product than pushing for traction,” he explained. “Using Bitholla you can set your own wallet, receiving payment address, make payment requests and send messages. Bitholla is a proximity service so it shows users nearest to you for convenience of paying people around you.”All bitcoin may need for Korea to adopt it is for it to reach critical mass in other parts of the world. “Korea is a follower country,” Chris Williams, co-founder of Korean Buddy, told Bitcoin Magazine . “Koreans need to see other countries using bitcoin, or a major company domestically adopt bitcoin or a couple of big celebrity endorsements for the normal person to start using bitcoin.” He also explained that the ambiguity of regulation in South Korea could be interfering in adoption. “Is it legal? How is it going to be taxed? Do businesses need a license to accept it?” Williams said, suggesting this uncertainty could be impeding others from trying the technology.But that hasn’t stopped him from creating a product he believes will help adoption. KoreanBuddy “is a virtual Korean shopping agent service. With this service people will be able to buy anything in Korea with bitcoin. We are a commission-based shopping agent. The shoppers tell us what they want … and we order and ship the items to them.”He compared his service, which he expects to launch on January 4, to tourist info centers where people go in foreign cities. “We want to be the [tourist info centers] to all foreigners who want to shop online here in Korea. The Korean online shopping info center.”The market may be small in Korea, but the excitement is intense. Day 1 of Inside Bitcoins had topics that covered bitcoin as an investment, blockchain technology for nontechnical people, and bitcoin trading and analysis. Day 2 of the event, which will include the competition, will have panels on rate of adoption, blockchain loyalty and customers, and a panel on why bitcoin commerce is broken. Jacob Cohen Donnelly is a consultant and journalist in the bitcoin space.

    "text": "Bhagwan Chowdhry, a Professor of Finance at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) has nominated Satoshi Nakamoto for the 2016 Nobel Prize in Economics.The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Economics, is an award for outstanding contributions to the field of economics. It is generally regarded as the most prestigious award for that field. “The committee has invited me to nominate someone for the 2016 Prize,” writes Chowdhry in The Huffington Post. “I then started thinking whose ideas are likely to have a disruptive influence in the twenty first century. The name of the inventor of Bitcoin suddenly jumped up in my consciousness and I have not been able to get it out of my mind since then, Satoshi Nakamoto.” Will Satoshi Nakamoto, the Inventor of #Bitcoin, Win the 2016 #NobelPrize in Economics? https://t.co/NhTErS6iM9“The invention of bitcoin – a digital currency – is nothing short of revolutionary,” continues Chowdhry. “[Bitcoin] is digital and exists purely as a mathematical object. It offers many advantages over both physical and paper currencies. It is secure, relying on almost unbreakable cryptographic code, can be divided into millions of smaller sub-units, and can be transferred securely and nearly instantaneously from one person to any other person in the world with access to internet bypassing governments, central banks and financial intermediaries such as Visa, Mastercard, Paypal or commercial banks eliminating time delays and transactions costs.” Of course, Chowdhry is aware that the Nobel Committee is unlikely to accept the nomination of a pseudonymous candidate. That’s why the article’s title is “I (Shall Happily) Accept the 2016 Nobel Prize in Economics on Behalf of Satoshi Nakamoto.” “There’s no real precedent for awarding the Nobel Prize to an unknown person (or possibly even group of people), so it’s difficult to say how the Prize committee will deal with the nomination,” notesGizmodo. “But even so, the fact that Bitcoin and Nobel Prize in Economics are being talked about in the same breath is significant all on its own.” “I would be happy to go and accept the Prize on [Nakamoto’s] behalf,” says Chowdhry. “What about the acceptance speech? That won't be any problem either. He can write his speech, digitally sign it and send it to me securely. I would, of course, rehearse and deliver it on his behalf at the Prize ceremony.” Even so, it still seems unlikely that the Nobel Committee will accept the nomination. But it’s interesting to imagine that Nakamoto could choose this moment to reveal his identity, which would force the Committee to accept his nomination and take it seriously. As Chowdhry notes, Satoshi is so rich that the financial reward wouldn’t matter much – he is still sitting on a huge stash of bitcoin that he could sell anytime – but the temptation of joining the very select club of Nobel Laureates is difficult to resist. If Satoshi ever chooses to disclose his identity, now seems like a very appropriate time. That Satoshi Nakamoto deserves a Nobel Prize is difficult to deny. As Chowdhry notes, bitcoin as a currency and an efficient payment means is just the tip of the iceberg. The disruptively innovative nature of Bitcoin lies in the possibility of decentralized trustless agreements and digital contracts that can be digitized, securely verified and stored, and transferred instantaneously from one party to another. “The implications of this are immense,” says Chowdhry, and adds that Bitcoin is likely to upend the role central banks play in conducting monetary policy. “The consumers will be big beneficiaries and indeed the poor and marginal sections of the society will reap the benefits of financial and social inclusion in the coming decades,” he says. It’s interesting to note that Satoshi Nakamoto might have already received the Nobel Prize in Economics. In fact, the rumors that the unknown identity behind Satoshi could be the mathematician John Nash of A Beautiful Mind fame, who received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994, never quite died out. Nash, who openly proposed many ideas for next-generation economics that can be related to Bitcoin and considered as precursors, for example the Ideal Money concept, passed away in May 2015. ",

    "text": "Fidor Bank, the innovative German bank that is bringing Bitcoin and digital fintech to mainstream banking, is now operating in Great Britain.Fidor Bank, one of the world’s most innovative banks disrupting the traditional banking sector, has been recognized by the World Economic Forum as a “Global Growth Company.”Founded in Germany in 2009, Fidor Bank offers a new approach to financial services.“Traditional banks do not reflect their customers’ needs in the digital age,” notes the Fidor Bank UK website. “Customer requirements are not being met by traditional banks because of lack of innovation, increasing the distance between banks and their customers.”A key feature of Fidor Bank is its community site, where users and representatives of the bank discuss the financial services provided by the bank in an open forum. The Fidor Bank community has become one of the most active financial communities in Germany, where more than 250,000 users, bank employees and board members engage in discussions around the clock. Of course, Fidor Bank UK has also a Facebook page.The Fidor Bank Community Product Reviews section offers a free overview of the advantages and disadvantages of a wide range of financial products. Product reviews are completely independent and consist solely of the views of community members, with feedback from the bank.Fidor Bank Community members develop reputation and “karma” points, and can join interest groups. The most popular interest group is dedicated to cryptocurrencies. This is not surprising, because Fidor Bank is popular among Bitcoin users and considered as the most Bitcoin-friendly mainstream bank. In October, Fidor Bank partnered with bitcoin exchange Kraken to create the world’s first cryptocurrency bank.In February, the bank announced a “Bitcoin Express” option for German customers to buy and sell bitcoin instantly on the bitcoin.de partner exchange. Holders of a “Fidor Smart Giro Account” can purchase bitcoin directly from their bank accounts and receive bitcoin immediately after the purchase. They can also sell bitcoin to another Smart Giro Account holder and have the money instantly credited to their accounts. The Smart Giro Account is a full bank account with all the standard features, including interest on credit balances and a low-cost credit card. The latter is, in practice, equivalent to a card that can be recharged with bitcoin.Similar services might soon be made available to customers in the U.K. as well.Commenting on the recent launch of Coinbase in the U.K., The Financial Timesnoted that Great Britain is on its way to becoming a global hub for bitcoin and digital currencies, with both the government and Bank of England having made recent moves designed to stimulate the development of digital fintech.A recent U.K. Treasury document titled “Digital Currencies: Response to the Call for Information” shows that the government is interested in supporting and understanding blockchain-based digital fintech, and understands the potential benefits it could bring to society.Only U.K. residents can open a Fidor Bank U.K. account. Some Reddit users have already done so, and reported their first experiences.",

    "text": "On the Nasdaq website, Martin Tillier asks, “Could Bitcoin Destroy the Global Banking System?”Tillier imagines a possible “Kodak moment” for the whole banking industry. In the early days of mobile phones, only a few enthusiasts dared to imagine that camera-equipped phones could ever threaten established camera manufacturers, but Kodak was forced to declare bankruptcy only a few years later, in 2012.Tillier’s answer is that yes, Bitcoin could seriously hurt the banking system. The reason is very simple:“Banks are so used to taking a cut every time money changes hands that they cannot imagine life without that particular revenue stream.”Transaction fees are only a small part of banks’ revenue, and therefore banks could survive without that particular revenue stream. But they would be seriously annoyed:“[Transaction revenue] is some of the only money that banks make that has zero associated risk and very little associated cost,” notes Tillier. “There is no risk, and hardly any cost, in charging you $30 to receive a wire transfer, especially when the bank takes three days of interest on that money by delaying payment to you. If that revenue is removed or even seriously reduced, it will have to be replaced, meaning that a higher proportion of bank revenue will be coming from increasingly risky loans or trading.”The unique advantage of the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin is that it permits faster, cheaper, and transparent transactions. Every bitcoin transaction is permanently recorded in the tamper-proof public blockchain, which is maintained by Bitcoin users at zero cost to the banks. The fact that we can transfer bitcoin instantly (in a few seconds, or a few minutes waiting for the transaction to be confirmed by the network) to the other side of the planet, at a very low cost, shows that traditional banking fees are obsolete legacy practices that must be abandoned. Innovative Bitcoin “banks” such as Circle (which is not technically a bank, but plays an equivalent role for its clients) are doing just that, and beginning to offer cheap and fast money transfers.“[Bitcoin] may well be a threat to the easy money that banks currently take from you and me, but that doesn’t pose an existential threat to the system,” concludes Tillier. “The banks’ reaction to a reduction in that easy money, on the other hand, could be a different story.”Of course, the banks won’t give up their easy money without a fight. Barclays’ CEO Antony Jenkins recently discussed the growing concern among financial institutions that faster, cheaper payment systems will start to seduce their consumer and business customers in the coming years.In a recent report titled “Digital Disruption – UK Banking Report,” the British Banking Association argues that Bitcoin is a threat to the banking industry.“As digital and cryptocurrencies gain traction, the threat to banks' free-income streams will grow,” notes the report. “Banks must invest time and energy in understanding how best to use the technology behind principles like bitcoin, before other players step in to make that decision for them.”Of course, banks can (and do) also lobby to make digital cryptocurrency illegal, but the United Kingdom and other governments recently have expressed open-minded positions in the interest of common good. Meanwhile, forward-looking banks such as German Fidor Bank are integrating Bitcoin with their consumer banking operations.The term “threats” frequently occurs in official reports related to the emerging digital economy. In a recent discussion paper, the Australian government mentions bitcoin and digital currencies as potential threats to tax collection.“New ways of transacting, including cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, were not contemplated when the current tax system was designed,” notes the report. “These developments make determining the appropriate tax outcome for a particular company in a specific country difficult and raise concerns about the ability of companies to relocate profits to minimize their tax.”Other governments are less scared of Bitcoin as a threat to taxation, probably because they are confident in their ability to de-anonymize bitcoin transactions and trace them back to their originators. In the United States, there have been proposals to gradually introduce tax payments in Bitcoin, which would constitute a quite radical shift from early libertarian perceptions of Bitcoin as a financial privacy tool.Photo via stantontcady / CC BY-ND 2.0",

    "text": "Legendary Internet pioneer Nicholas Negroponte, a founder of the MIT Media Laband the One Laptop per Child initiative (OLPC), gave a controversial talk at theScaling Bitcoin workshop in Montreal.The Scaling Bitcoin workshop has been focused on how to safely improve the scalability and decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network, and included many technical talks on current issues such as the block-size debate and proposed enhancements such as lightning networks.But Negroponte chose to keep away from these technical implementation details and focus on the big picture, the “raison d’être” of Bitcoin, its political dimension, and its implications for the evolution of society, with a high-level approach similar to that of his 1995 book “Being Digital” on the future of the then-emerging Internet.Negroponte mentioned his past involvement with DigiCash, an electronic money corporation founded by cryptographer David Chaum in 1989. DigiCash, which pioneered anonymous digital transactions and is often considered a conceptual precursor of Bitcoin, declared bankruptcy in 1998. Negroponte was an investor and the first chairman.“Chaum’s raison d’être was electronic privacy, and his plans for DigiCash were ambitious,” noted a Forbes article titled “Requiem for a Bright Idea” published after the DigiCash went out of business. “Digital pseudonyms would protect the identity of Netizens as they roamed the Web. Chaum became a hero to cyberlibertarians.”Despite his past involvement with DigiCash and the idea of electronic transactions, Negroponte definitely doesn’t come across as a cyberlibertarian. On the contrary, he self-identifies as a socialist. “If it’s not clear, I am about as socialist as you can get,” says Negroponte at the beginning of the Q&A session after the talk. “I come from an era and a part of the world where socialism was viewed as good.”Negroponte opened his talk with three anecdotes: the spontaneous use of sky lift e-tickets as a parallel currency by the people of a Swiss sky resort; his experience as target of cybercrime by hackers who impersonated him via email and stole a lot of money from his bank account, which he couldn’t recover even after the intervention of his brother John Negroponte, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State; and his recent experiences in Greece when the banks were closed as a consequence of the Greek crisis.Negroponte is firmly persuaded of the importance of Bitcoin.“I can’t think of too many things that are more important than Bitcoin,” he said. “And don’t blow it. Don’t screw it up.”Many people in the audience applauded at this point, including libertarians and crypto-anarchists, but these didn’t applaud much after Negroponte started to explain his thoughts on how to ensure a bright future for Bitcoin – with a socialist slant.The worst thing entrepreneurs can do, according to Negroponte, is to consider Bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme, because treating Bitcon as such creates large price fluctuations and episodes that scare people away from Bitcoin. On the contrary, Bitcoin should be approached with a sense of mission – a mission to make the world a better place, he said. Negroponte urged the entrepreneurs in the audience to do non-profits.Similar considerations apply beyond Bitcoin. Negroponte, who has been involved in about 60 startups himself, is critical of the startup culture. Today’s startups, according to Negroponte, cause enormous brain drain.“Some of the smartest kids are being sucked out of society to do the stupid apps on some iPads with their girlfriends and boyfriends,” he said (another applause here), instead of working on big, hard problems. Here, Negroponte seems to agree with hardcore libertarian venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who, in an interviewpublished on MIT Technology Review, exhorted entrepreneurs to go after bigger problems than the ones Silicon Valley is chasing.“We wanted flying cars; instead we got 140 characters,” Thiel said.Though the role of entrepreneurs and philanthropists in technology development is often emphasized, Negroponte thinks civil servants also have an important role to play. He considers roads, public transportation, education and the Internet itself as important parts of the infrastructure of a civil society, which should be developed by the government and made available to everyone at no cost.Currency – including emerging digital currencies like Bitcoin – should also be part of the essential infrastructure provided by the government, he said. Bitcoin is important from a global point of view, said Negroponte, and could help creating much-needed global governance structures in an increasingly fragmented world.“What’s wrong in being run by the government?” asked Negroponte, “If you think the government can’t run anything, go to Switzerland and ride a train.” He added that Finland has the world’s best education system, and no private schools. While acknowledging that there are lessons to be learned from libertarians, Negroponte sees an important role for the government to collect taxes and distribute benefits to everyone.Negroponte’s talk, which is likely to provoke heated debates, can be interpreted as self-serving. In fact, the Digital Currency Initiative at MIT Media Lab, founded by Negroponte, is claiming a role of arbitration and leadership in Bitcoin developments, in prestigious academic settings far from get-rich-quick schemes, and Negroponte hinted at the Media Lab’s role at several points in the talk.Photo Gin Kai / Wikimedia (CC)",

    "text": "European Bitcoin exchange BitStamp launched a pre-paid debit card that can be loaded with bitcoin on Wednesday.According to the London-based exchange, the debit card is accepted at anywhere major credit and debit cards are accepted. The card’s balance can be denominated either in British pounds, euros or American dollars.The debit card has three stages of verification, each with its own spending limit. The most basic stage requires no know-your-customer verification and allows for €2,500 worth of transactions annually. Government ID, proof of residence, and a certified source of funds document is required for the highest annual spending limit, €125,000.Crypto Debit CardThe debit cards can be ordered now. They are first received in a digital form that can be used only at online websites. A physical card for usage at brick-and-mortar retail stores can be ordered for $10. The card will take 10 to 15 business days to arrive.After receiving the card, users can transfer bitcoin from a BitStamp account to it; a $10 flat fee will be taken for transfers of $1,000 or less. A 2 percent fee will be taken for anything above that.Card holders will be able to see their transaction history, retrieve their PIN, order new cards and more at cardportal.com.The debit card was launched through a partnership with the European and Latin American payment processor AstroPay. The London-based company operates the largest payment network in Latin America and has partnered with several Bitcoin companies in the past, including Latin American Bitcoin exchange Bitex.la, cryptocurrency development company Ripple Labs and the now-defunct exchange Mt Gox.The card currently is not available to U.S. citizens. The Bitcoin exchange hopes to expand the service to United States, but BitStamp founder and CEO Nejc Kodrič said no launch date has been determined.",

    "text": "European Bitcoin exchange and payment processor SpectroCoin launched a debit card earlier this week that can be loaded with digital currency and spent at anywhere major debit and credit cards are accepted.A press release by London-headquartered SpectroCoin said the debit card can be issued to residents of 150 countries and is accepted at merchants around the globe.The startup, which also has offices in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, is focused on bolstering bitcoin adoption in Eastern Europe, a region largely overlooked by most digital currency companies. The debit card is SpectroCoin’s latest effort to make spending bitcoin easy in the region, something the startup holds is crucial to the long-term success of the digital currency.“For SpectroCoin users, it means broader spectrum of withdrawal options, as they are no longer dependent on their bank card and do not have to wait for wire transfer to be able to withdraw cash, which means quicker and cheaper link between bitcoin and cash for SpectroCoin users,” SpectroCoin co-founder and CEO Vytautas Karalevičius told Bitcoin Magazine via email. “It is a step towards being one-stop shop for bitcoin.”Fees and spending limitsTo order the card, simply go to the dashboard of your SpectroCoin account and click on the ‘Order Debit Card’ section toward the bottom of the screen. From there you will be taken to a screen which will prompt you to fill in an order sheet; shipping the card to you takes 4-7 days and costs €7. After you receive the card, you can manage your card form SpectroCoin account.For point-of-sale purchases, no fees are charged but a one percent fee is tacked on when loading the card with bitcoin. Using the card to withdraw cash through an ATM in United Kingdom costs €2.25; in any other country there is a €2.75 fee.The maximum loading limit and card balance is €10,000 for verified users; €1,000 is the maxium cash withdrawing limit. To get verified, a card-holder must provide a form of ID and a utility bill. For unverified users, the limits of are one-fourth that of verified users.SpectroCoin was unwilling to share who issued the card when asked by Bitcoin Magazine, but did say it was issued by a company in Gibraltar, an overseas British territory south of Spain, which is regulated by the country’s Financial Services Commission. Gibraltar is part of the European Union, and as such local financial companies are also regulated by E.U. governing bodies.SpectroCoin’s announcement comes a week after Bitcoin Magazine reported on another European exchange, BitStamp, which released a debit card as well. Their card is similar to the Baltic startup’s, including the fees and spending limits, but BitStamps’ also allowed for users to receive a digital debit card.",

    "text": "Blockchain startup Onename launched its new product Passcard this week, which uses a blockchain-tied profile to create a secure and “trustless” identity. Onename plans on eventually using it as a sort of digital key to your identity, potentially replacing passwords, the keys to your house and even your passport.Onename takes advantage of Bitcoin’s distributed ledger, the blockchain, which is used to record and verify bitcoin transactions. It is what enables the digital currency to properly function and can also be used to record any kind of information in a public ledger.“Passcards are a digital form of identity and access control designed to initially replace passwords, and in the future, replace forms of physical identification like passports and driver’s licenses. You’ll be able to use it to enter your apartment or your office and when asked to present identification in an in-person context. The future of identity is here,” read the company’s blog post.Your access to everythingPasscards will expand upon the company’s earlier blockchain identity product, which was just a onename.io-hosted profile, by creating a fuller identity, allowing users to post their Passcard on websites, such as a blog or company website.The move in is preparation of enabling blockchain profiles to be used to log into websites and apps. That will give the product its first real use case and actual utility.“Currently, passwords help you access your online life just like your wallet and keys help you access your physical life. At a high level, passwords, identity cards, and keys are all forms of access control. Want to enter a bar? Show an identity card that says that you’re over 21. Want to access your Twitter account? Login with the username/password that you used to signup. Want to enter your home? Use the key that unlocks the door,” read a public statement.Passcard can be seen in use on the blog of Onename investor Fred Wilson and the team page of decentralized marketplace project OpenBazaar. To get your own passcard, you can sign up at a registrar such as Onename.io or Namecoin.info. Onename also created Passcard.info, which serves as a portal for the new product and hosts a list of registrars.Passcard uses a technology called Blockchain Name System (BNS), formerly called Onename, which, according to the company’s founders, Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea, is similar to Domain Name System (DNS), but offers more security as there are “no trusted third parties or servers.”The startup will be announcing more about BNS and will launch the app login feature soon.Onename was founded in March 2014. The company raised a $1.5 million seed round from Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, Fred Wilson through Union Square Ventures, AngelList CEO and co-founder Naval Ravikant and investment firm SV Angel.",

    "text": "Chainalysis offers a service that provides financial institutions with the means to obtain regulatory compliance through real-time analysis of the blockchain. Based in Switzerland and headed by ex-Kraken COO Michael Grønager and former Mycelium engineer Jan Møller, the company provides an API for sophisticated in-depth real-time blockchain transaction analysis.Chainalysis customers – including regulatory entities, law enforcement and financial service providers – are empowered with unique insight on all transactions recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain and tools to determine the origin of the bitcoin held by any address.Bitcoin transactions are not anonymous. Every transaction and the full transaction history of any Bitcoin address are permanently recorded in the tamper-proof public blockchain and open to analysis. The illusion of anonymity stems from the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin addresses, which are not explicitly associated to their owners.But blockchain analysis can often de-anonymize bitcoin users. For example, if a pseudonymous Bitcoin address often sends funds to another address that can be associated to a person (for example a Circle user), it is highly probable that the two persons are one and the same, or closely related.Recommended privacy practices, from simple measures such as using fresh Bitcoin addresses for new transactions to strong privacy measures such as dark wallets and mixing services, reduce the risk of being de-anonymized. But the fact that all bitcoin transactions are recorded in the blockchain implies that even one mistake can de-anonymize a user, and especially so when sophisticated blockchain analysis tools are available. In particular, the end-point where bitcoin is exchanged for cash, goods or services is vulnerable.A few weeks ago, Chainalysis was forced to defend itself after allegations it had disrupted services with a “Sybil attack” that created more than 250 “false” Bitcoin nodes to harvest information on the whereabouts of transactions, which provoked strong and often angered reactions by the Bitcoin community. Grønager toldCoinDesk that Chainalysis permits monitoring compliance with applicable money transfer regulations, and therefore helps Bitcoin companies to obtain bank accounts and do business with mainstream financial institutions.It is evident that Bitcoin is moving toward mainstreaming and regulations, and therefore services such Chainalysis are here to stay, but such services likely will continue to meet opposition from an important part of the Bitcoin community. A leaked Chainalysis roadmap, now trending on Reddit, has been received with anger and hostile comments.The leaked roadmap sheds light on the current and forthcoming features of the Chainalysis API. For example, Chainalysis customers will soon be able to “search by transaction hash, cluster name, category etc. [which] will allow for faster investigations via known clusters of interest but also for the API to answer specific questions about transactions or entities of interest.” Soon after that, the API will support unconfirmed transactions as well as “Shared multi client repositories for known bad actor reporting,” and an “Advanced Profiling API” is in the works. The roadmap also details Chainalysis pricing plans – for example, Institutional clients will pay $500 per month for a set of features including unlimited investigations, shared fraud databases and full API access.Many participants in the Reddit discussion are expressing support for strong privacy tools, such as Dark Wallet and the Lightning Network, which may offer better protection against Chainalysis snooping.",

Third Key Solutions is the culmination of her work advising bitcoin startups in multi-signature governance processes and key management.Your company’s recovery plan is the most important document you can create to ensure your business will survive an emergency. If you operate a bitcoin-, altcoin- or asset-token-based business, a recovery plan isn’t just nice to have – it’s absolutely necessary. A strong, well-thought-out recovery plan can help to prevent opportunistic fraud and asset transfer mistakes by providing clear guidance during atypical events. Coin recovery should be just one part of your overall strategic operations and recovery plan. These guidelines are one tool that your company may use in building its recovery plan.When to plan? New organizations should complete the plan prior to launch, reviewing and updating the plan quarterly throughout the first year. After Year One, you’ll probably need to update your plan once or twice a year. If your company has already launched and you don’t have a recovery plan, do it now. Don’t wait. Don’t put it off until you find some spare time. You owe it to your customers, your team, your investors and yourself to get this done within the next 30 days.Is this a complete guide? No, but it’s a great start. The following list is meant to begin a discussion within your company about policies and procedures relating to recovery. It’s not meant to be an exhaustive list, and your team should add concerns as they arise.Vital Records:What vital records are required for recovery of coin?What vital records are required for the continuation of the business? (For example, what data do you need of employees, clients, vendors, investors; accounting and payroll records; insurance policies; tax returns; contracts; etc.?)Where are they backed up?How will they be accessed in case of emergency?Who has authorization to access them?Are they encrypted?Who has the encryption passwords?Who is responsible for records management?Who is responsible to update the backup copies of these records and how often?Where are insurance contracts located, if any?Recovery Event Processes: (recovering funds from single addresses)Who is responsible to initiate the recovery and under what circumstances?Who must initially verify the request and what are the verification standards?How is verification documented in an auditable way?To what address will the recovery transaction sweep the funds?Who created the address and how is customer/client control preserved?Has the new address been tested?Who will create the recovery transaction?How will the recovery transactions be verified, as properly authorized and going to the correct address?What methods are in place to eliminate opportunities for collusion or bad actors?How will the verified transactions be transmitted to the recovery company?What is the process for the recovery company to verify the validity of the recovery request?What if the recovery company cannot verify the recovery request or if the recovery request was unauthorized?If the recovery company provides signed transactions, who is responsible to broadcast them and under what circumstances, if any, should they not be broadcast? (This is particularly relevant in an entire tree recovery)Recovery Event Processes: (recovering funds from HD or HDM trees)Review the Recovery Event Process in terms of recovering an entire tree or all trees.What changes?Are there additional safeguards in place to prevent errors?Who, within the company, will be responsible to oversee the recovery of trees?In the event the company is no longer operational, who will be responsible to facilitate recovery?Payment for Recovery:Who will pay transaction fees for the recovery transactions?How will transaction fees be paid (company hot wallet, pre-divided UTXO, customer)?Will the transaction fees be chained, affecting confirmation of other recovery transactions?Who will pay the recovery company’s fees?If a fund has been set up to pay recovery fees, who manages/administers the fund?If not, how will recovery companies be paid?Communication:Who is responsible to communicate to customers/clients/employees/public about the recovery?Are there communication policies in place that govern crisis communications?If so, where can employees find the policies during a crisis?Changes to the Recovery Plan:How often is the plan reviewed and by whom? (must be at least annually)Who is authorized to make changes to the plan and by what process are changes made?Where is the recovery plan stored?Are redundant copies stored securely off-site?How will they be accessed in case of emergency?Who has authorization to access them?Are they stored encrypted?Who has the encryption passwords?Who is responsible to update the redundant plans and ensure the most current versions are properly stored?Building a Key Compromise Policy:How many keys are currently in use in the company and to which assets/addresses/projects are they associated?Who are the authorized signers for each address and where are the primary keys stored?Where and how are backup keys stored?What is a key compromise? (Examples include: system hacked, vulnerability identified on key generation or storage device, physical compromise of key storage location, authorized signer leaves the organization, incomplete chain of custody logs.)How will the company learn that one or more keys may have been compromised?Who should be notified of possible compromise?What confidentiality policies, if any, are implemented during investigation of compromise?What steps should be taken (in succession) during the investigation of a possible compromise?How will a compromise be confirmed or disproved?Who should be notified if compromise is confirmed?How will they be notified?What is the process for investigating possible compromise?What is the process for migrating funds if the company’s security is breached? If the third party’s security is breached?What is the process for limiting damage to clients and the company itself in the event of key compromise?Personnel: In the event of emergency, who will be responsible to coordinate company efforts and lead the Recovery Team? Who should be part of a Recovery Team?Physical Locations: If you have a physical location, you should also consider physical evacuation procedures, employee communications, and business continuity plans for geographic natural disasters including fire, flood, etc.Encrypted Communications: As a reminder, encrypting and signing communications whenever possible protects both confidentiality and authenticity (prevents man-in-the-middle and impersonation attacks).Audited Standards: Companies should consider building systems compliant to industry best practices and standards, such as the CryptoCurrency Security Standard.

    "text": "The Open Bitcoin Privacy Project (OBPP), has released a report on 10 leading Bitcoin wallets, setting standards for privacy that they argue are much needed in the space. The Bitcoin wallets in the report include Coinbase, Blockchain.info, Mycelium, Darkwallet, Airbitz, Armory, Electrum, Bitcoin Wallet and Multibit Classic.According to the report, Darkwallet is the most privacy-concerned wallet, while Coinbase falls on the other end of the spectrum.OBPP is a Bitcoin privacy research organization lead by prominent figures in the Bitcoin community, including Kristov Atlas, a well-known privacy researcher; software designer Justus Ranvier; engineer Daniel Krawisz at Monetas; technical illustrator Samuel Peterson, and others.The researchers looked at various aspects of wallet software, including where public addresses are generated, whether clients (such as light wallets) need to ask trusted servers for the balance of their accounts, whether users are protected from blockchain observers through the use of coin mixers or stealth addresses.All off the test results added up to three categories of testing: usability, quality and feedback. These three add up for a total privacy score of up to 100 points. All wallet providers were sent a questionnaire and given a chance to review the research results before publishing. Almost half of the wallet developers did not respond to the questionnaire.The three lowest ranked wallets for privacy: Coinbase, Multibit, Blockchain.info,Coinbase is a leading U.S. Bitcoin company that provides exchange and payment processing services as well as wallet services. Both of these wallets provide custodial services to users and keep control over their private keys, with the exception of Coinbase Vault’s support for multi-signature wallets. OBPP focused on the classic version, which keeps full control over their user’s private keys. It did not fare well under their tests.“Because of the custodial nature of Coinbase’s wallet, users are afforded low privacy. Private keys are generated and held server-side, and the service retains detailed information about incoming and outgoing transactions. Customers must undergo a stringent identification process in order to use the service. The wallet generates new Bitcoin addresses for change, but employs few other basic controls to protect privacy on the blockchain,” said the authors of the OBPP report.The authors also point out that Coinbase can improve these privacy vulnerabilities and remain compliant with anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer rules by discouraging address reuse and providing better feedback to users about actions that will degrade their privacy.The Coinbase wallet scored only 11 out of 100 possible points for privacy. Only a few points above Coinbase was the Blockchain.info wallet. Blockchain.info is one of the oldest companies in the Bitcoin wallet space and were the first to advocate full user control over private keys, a standard that set the bar for all wallet providers.As early leaders in the Bitcoin wallet race, their web and mobile wallets quickly became the most widely used, with nearly 3.4 million wallets in existence, according to OBPP.While Blockchain.info has made efforts toward improving user privacy, including the launch of their CoinJoin bitcoin mixing technology, they have fallen behind by not implementing hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets. This generally means that users must manually create new addresses for each transaction for maximum privacy and continuously update their backups, instead of new addresses being automatically generate for each transaction from a common seed.According to the OBPP report, Blockchain.info’s web and mobile wallets function so differently that they analyzed each individually, and they received scores of 22 and 14 out of 100 respectively, leaving them at above only Coinbase in the rankings.Kristov Atlas told Bitcoin Magazine that “The single biggest differentiator for the spring 2015 rankings was whether the wallet was [hierarchical deterministic]”First place: DarkwalletAt the top of the rankings is Darkwallet, a Google Chrome extension wallet. Darkwallet made international headlines over the past two years as an anonymity and anti-surveillance software initiative founded by activists Amir Taaki and Cody Wilson. Its objective is to make Bitcoin finance “go dark.”The Darkwallet project has been noticeably absent from the media in the past months but the development build of the wallet put it at the lead as far as total privacy with a score of 54.“Darkwallet in the only wallet we’ve considered so far which includes automatic CoinJoin mixing and ECDH stealth addresses. Another notable feature in Darkwallet is an automatic P2P network for messaging between users,” according to the OBPP report.Darkwallet is indeed the only major Bitcoin wallet with stealth addresses (SA) natively supported for recipients and senders. Some wallets, such as Electrum, support sending, but not receiving, SA transactions. Because of the nature of SA, it is essential that other wallets support the technology to enhance its utility and standardization.Two of the weaknesses of Darkwallet were its dependence on “Obelisk servers which have the ability to de-anonymize users,” coupled with low user activity, which makes it much harder to find others to mix up your transactions with, particularly with significant amounts of bitcoin.Since Darkwallet is still in alpha development, future growth of the user base could alleviate the liquidity problems of their mixing process. Nevertheless, the OBPP researchers expressed uncertainty about the future of the project given that has not released a stable build yet and no development activity has occurred since February 2015. The Darkwallet developers did not respond to the OBPP questionnaire.Desktop wallets: Armory, Electrum, MultibitTaking second-place in overall privacy ranking is Armory, the full-node Bitcoin vault that provides wallet security software for the intermediate and advanced Bitcoin users and enterprise customers. Armory is available for Linux, Windows and OSX and is among the more resource-intensive wallets, in part because it’s designed to run a full bitcoin node. It had a total privacy score of 54, tying it for first place with Darkwallet.Armory was praised for supporting with hierarchical deterministic (HD) address generation and not reusing addresses by default, as well as supporting TOR connections with minimal configuration.The researchers suggest that Armory can improve privacy protections for users by supporting a mixing protocol such as CoinJoin as well as by informing users when they are making choices that compromise their privacy, a common criticism leveled at most the wallets included in the report.Electrum followed the desktop wallets with a score of 46, tying it for fifth place with the mobile Bitcoin Wallet. It earned that ranking for its support of HD addresses, using a 12-word seed for a one-time backup, as well as its default generation of new addresses per transaction. But most noticeably, Electrum was praised for being included in the privacy-centric Tails operating system, as well as its easy compatibility with TOR connections.Electrum’s largest weakness, according to OBPP, was its reliance in a federated network of Electrum servers which connect it to the Bitcoin network. The researcher suggest Electrum could improve its score by adding support for stealth addresses and CoinJoin.The most private mobile wallets: Mycelium, Bitcoin Wallet, Electrum, AirBitzTaking third place with a score of 50 was Mycelium, the Android and iOS Bitcoin wallet which regularly earns praise for its privacy features. Mycelium ranked highly for its use of HD wallets and its easy support for TOR connections.However, it was criticized for relying on the Mycelium servers rather than Bitcoin peers to connect to the Bitcoin network. This weakness, they argue, allows the company to gather information on users. This weakness was common among most Bitcoin wallets, except those running a full node, such as Armory.Following Mycelium were Bitcoin Wallet, Electrum and Airbitz, all with scores of 45 or 46 out of 100.These mid-ranked wallets generally suffered from the same weaknesses: reliance on central servers to connect to the Bitcoin network, no support of stealth addresses, and no graphic user interface warnings informing users about choices that compromise their privacy. Among the four mobile wallets, only Mycelium and Airbitz responded to the questionnaire provided by the OBPP.Interested parties can read the full report here and contribute to the OBPP efforts at their website.",

    "title": "Brian Armstrong, CEO of record-funded Bitcoin wallet service and exchange Coinbase, plans a code update to allow for bigger blocks",
    "text": "Brian Armstrong, CEO of record-funded Bitcoin wallet service and exchange Coinbase, plans a code update to allow for bigger blocks in the second week of December, and has indicated he prefers BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) 101. This makes Coinbase the latest Bitcoin industry heavyweight to endorse the proposal as adopted by alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT, although the company is still open to other solutions. Armstrong recently sent out a seriesoftweets in support of a block-size increase, in which he stated the intention to upgrade his company's code by December. It was not clear, however, whether these tweets indicated support for BIP 101, the block-increase proposal that is programmed to increase the maximum block size eightfold to 8MB, doubling each other year until it reaches 8GB. While BIP 101 is endorsed by several leading companies in the Bitcoin space, other proposals have gathered significantsupport, too. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Armstrong confirmed that Coinbase plans to upgrade its code to allow for bigger blocks in December of this year, and while the preferred solution is not set in stone, Coinbase currently favors BIP 101. “We are open to evaluating all proposals which increase the block size. But we do plan to upgrade around the second week of December, so this will require working solutions in code by then. The only one I'm aware of which currently has working code is BIP 101,” Armstrong said. Moreover, Armstrong indicated that he'd like the Bitcoin industry to switch to Bitcoin XT, the alternative Bitcoin implementation run by Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen that implemented BIP 101 in August of this year. “In my view, Bitcoin XT is the best option I've seen so far. Not just because it has working code, but also because it has a simple implementation that is easy to understand, the block-size increases seem about right to me, and I have confidence in the people behind the project. My preference at this point would be to have Gavin step up as the final decision-maker on Bitcoin XT, and have the industry move to that solution with help from Mike Hearn, Jeff Garzik and others that wish to do so.” The CEO believes an upgrade is urgently needed in order for the Bitcoin network to handle a sudden increase of Bitcoin usage. As such, Armstrong emphasized that Coinbase will not wait for consensus to form among the Bitcoin development community. “We will upgrade regardless of whether Bitcoin Core is updated,” Armstrong said. “Capacity planning is something you should try to get ahead of. Growth can be unpredictable, and I want to remove all blockers to Bitcoin's success. I've been disappointed to see how slow Bitcoin Core has moved on this issue, and we're open to switching forks.” In an open letter published in September, a selection of prominent Bitcoin developers urged the Bitcoin community to take the time to evaluate proposals that have been put forward and agree on the best solutions via the consensus-building process. In particular, many of these developers argue that a switch to bigger blocks represents a big, perhaps even existential security risk. Armstrong told Bitcoin Magazine that he is aware of the potential risks of increasing the block-size limit, but said he believes these are being overstated. “When people offer opinions on things like this, it's important to consider their qualifications. In my case, I've implemented a Bitcoin node from scratch. I created the first version of the one Coinbase uses in production today, and I've helped us scale this bitcoin node from 0 to 2.7 million customers. So I've learned quite a lot about scaling a Bitcoin node during that time.” Armstrong explained. “It is a difficult judgment call, but I believe it is low enough risk, and the upside is considerable enough to make it worth it.” Other leading Bitcoin companies published an open letter in August in which they vowed to upgrade their code to increase the maximum block size. The letter expressed support for BIP 101, although three of itssigners have since indicated that alternative block increase proposals will be considered as well. Photo TechCrunch  / Flickr (CC) ",

    "text": "Over-the-counter (OTC) trading provides a way to efficiently trade larger amounts of bitcoin without driving down the overall market price. Traders using the OTC markets to buy and sell bitcoin are matched directly with a counterparty to execute the trade, rather than broadcasting their trade to the larger markets. These trades are usually conducted by a broker, who performs the function of matching buyers with sellers or even executes trades on its own behalf. OTC trades are often preferred by larger traders or institutions who want to open or exit a position without revealing their intentions to the market or affecting the market price. For example, many large miners and payment processors use OTC trades to sell the bitcoin they acquire to interested investors without flooding the exchanges. Because of this, OTC trading has always played a large role in the Bitcoin ecosystem, but the extent of that role has been largely unknown until now.ItBit releases third quarter OTC reportItBit is currently the only bitcoin exchange with a formal OTC trading desk, although there are other financial companies such as Genesis Trading that provide OTC trading services in bitcoin. These brokers and trading desks typically deal in trades of 100 BTC or more.ItBit, (the first bitcoin exchange to receive a banking charter), recently released its third quarter OTC report with details about its trading volumes:Total Bitcoin Volume Traded: 61,853 XBT Total USD Amount Traded: $15 Million Average Daily Trading Volume: 1,100 XBT Average Month-over-Month Trading Volume Growth: 71“There is no public data available in the digital currency OTC market, so it is hard to determine where we stand,\" itBit Director of Trading Bobby Cho told Bitcoin Magazine.\" By publicly publishing our key OTC trading data on a monthly basis (trade execution, volume-traded, etc.), we aim to bring much-needed transparency to this market.“Our hope is that other venues will join us in releasing public data, as the ultimate goal here should be to provide OTC traders with greater price discovery and fair market value,” Cho said. Genesis trading leads in trading volumeGenesis Trading, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, currently leads the OTC bitcoin market in volumes traded, but doesn’t publish quarterly statistics.“We typically trade over $10 million worth of BTC OTC per month,” Genesis Trading CEO Brendan O’Connor told Bitcoin Magazine. Coinbase Exchange is looking at OTC type servicesCoinbase, one of the larger exchanges and wallet providers, is actively looking at ways to provide some kind of a “white glove service” to prevent larger trades from moving the market price.\"We're constantly looking at ways to improve our users' trading experience, and adding features that facilitate large trades without moving the market are definitely on our radar,\" Coinbase Exchange Product Manager Adam White told Bitcoin Magazine. \"In addition to OTC trading we're evaluating other, potentially superior, ways of facilitating those types of trades.\"BTCC finds other ways to provide an OTC serviceOne of the world’s largest exchanges, BTCC, does not have a formal OTC trading desk but understands the importance of having some kind of “buffer” to prevent price slippage caused by larger orders.“BTCC doesn't offer OTC trading per se, because our exchange is liquid enough to fill large orders without any issue,\" Greg Wolfson, Business Development Director for BTCC told us. \"We also offer iceberg orders through our API, so large orders can be filled using that option as well.“We operate one of the largest mining pools in the world, so occasionally BTCC does facilitate OTC transactions for individuals who want to purchase large blocks of coins,” Wolfson said. “Additionally, we offer the option to purchase 'new coins' through our platform. These coins have a minimal transaction history, which makes them appealing to some in the bitcoin community, who regard 'new coins' as something akin to a proof set, like those offered by national mints around the world.”OKCoin’s Head of International Jack C. Liu understands the importance of OTC and market price buffers and told us, “We have not entered OTC trading as of yet. We think itBit is doing a good job of growing the market. The liquidity for larger sized trades at tight prices is there. That's good for the industry.” ",

    "text": "Lead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen, chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, has announced that he and other Bitcoin Core developers are joining the MIT Digital Currency Initiative.A few days ago Bitcoin Magazinereported that the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab announced the launch of a Digital Currency Initiative, to be directed by former White House senior adviser for mobile and data innovation Brian Forde.The MIT Digital Currency Initiative will integrate researchers across the institute and leading experts at other universities around the world to address some of the most critical challenges to creating a safe, stable and secure digital currency.Previously, MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito had hinted at the forthcoming initiative.“I’m offering MIT as a neutral academic home for some of the conversations and the technical coordination,” he said, “which I think will give a lot more stability to Bitcoin, which right now is a little bit fragile.”The Bitcoin Magazine article noted that there is an overlap between the terms of reference of the MIT Bitcoin Initiative and those of the Bitcoin Foundation, and speculated that, in view of the troubled history of the foundation, the Bitcoin community could welcome MIT as an alternative, prestigious venue for leadership and coordination of the Bitcoin ecosystem.Recently, Bitcoin Foundation board member Olivier Janssens wrote that the foundation had been undermined by “two years of ridiculous spending and poorly thought-out decisions” and was “effectively bankrupt.”It now appears that MIT is beginning to assume leadership in the Bitcoin development space.“I'm pleased to announce that I’ve joined the MIT Media Lab’s newly launched Digital Currency Initiative to continue my work on the Bitcoin project,\" Andresen said earlier today. \"I'm looking forward to working with all the amazing people associated with the initiative,” he says. “Wladimir van der Laan and Cory Fields, both formerly of the Bitcoin Foundation, have also decided that MIT is the best place to continue their work on Bitcoin Core and have joined the Media Lab as well.”“Over the last couple of months [it] became obvious that the foundation wouldn't be able to raise the funds necessary to continue supporting Wladimir, Cory, and me,” notes Andresen, and adds that MIT hasn’t taken over from the foundation as the center for core development, because “the Bitcoin Foundation was never the center of development.”Andresen concludes by thanking Ito and Forde for their leadership and support of the Bitcoin community through the Digital Currency Initiative.Forde, MIT Digital Currency Initiative director said he hopes that the MIT initiative will provide the support needed for the digital currency community to help realizing the “tremendous opportunities to increase access to critical financial services for all, create more transparent democracies, and develop services that dramatically reduce barriers for global commerce,” and looks forward to connecting with anyone who has feedback or new research.Bitcoin Magazine will continue to follow this story and publish updates shortly. Image via Web Summit / CC BY 2.0",

    "title": "In July Bitcoin Magazinereported that researchers and entrepreneurs at the MIT Media Lab had started the development of a new",
    "text": "In July Bitcoin Magazinereported that researchers and entrepreneurs at the MIT Media Lab had started the development of a new encryption system, dubbed Enigma, based on the blockchain technology. Enigma will enable untrusted and anonymous participants to securely share sensitive information with a third party. The name “Enigma” is part of the history of cryptography and code-breaking. It was the name of the electro-mechanical encryption system used by Germany before and during World War II, which was broken by a group of notable mathematicians and early computer scientists, including Alan Turing. Enigma was created by Oz Nathan, a technology entrepreneur formerly associated with the Counter Terror Unit of the Israeli Defense Forces, and Guy Zyskind, a graduate student and research assistant at the MIT Media Lab whose research interests lie at the intersection of data, privacy and Bitcoin. Zyskind’s advisor, Prof. Alex “Sandy” Pentland, is associated with the Enigma team. The new Enigma is powered by the blockchain. Enigma is a decentralized cloud platform with guaranteed privacy,” states the Enigma website. “Private data is stored, shared and analyzed without ever being fully revealed to any party. Secure multi-party computation, empowered by the blockchain, is the magical technology behind it.” In fact, protecting sensitive data is but a part of what Enigma will do. An important and innovative feature of the system is that it will permit analyzing the data stored by the system with external applications while keeping the data itself private and under full control of its owners. Furthermore, data owners will be able to monetize their data. For example, participants could anonymously sell partial, controlled access to their medical data to pharmaceutical companies that need to run data analysis programs on a wide sample of patients’ data. “[Enigma] is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, enabling different parties to jointly store and run computations on data while keeping the data completely private,” states the Enigma whitepaper written by Nathan, Zyskind and Pentland. “Enigma's computational model is based on a highly optimized version of secure multi-party computation, guaranteed by a verifiable secret-sharing scheme. For storage, Enigma uses a modified distributed hashtable for holding secret-shared data.  An external blockchain is utilized as the controller of the network, manages access control, identities and serves as a tamper-proof log of events. Security deposits and fees incentivize operation, correctness and fairness of the system,\" the whitepaper continues. \"Similar to Bitcoin, Enigma removes the need for a trusted third party, enabling autonomous control of personal data. For the first time, users are able to share their data with cryptographic guarantees regarding their privacy.”The Enigma creators won the final round of the Summer Startup Competition organized by the MIT Bitcoin Project in 2014. “The team winning the $5,000 grand prize, Ethos – comprised of MIT Media Lab grad students Amir Lazarovich & Guy Zyskind, along with Bitcoin entrepreneur Oz Nathan – had also won prizes in the two previous rounds,” states the MIT Bitcoin Project’s announcement. “Ethos wowed judges by submitting a working prototype of a decentralized network for storing and sharing personal data, delivering on the ambitious vision they laid out in the first two rounds.” Bitcoin Magazine reached out to the Enigma creators to find out more about Enigma’s objectives and future plans.  One of our missions with Enigma is to minimize the tradeoff between security and privacy, by enabling people and organizations to share data with each other, while maintaining control over how the data is used, without ever revealing the raw data to anyone,” Nathan told Bitcoin Magazine.Since July, the Enigma team’s work has been focused on three things: The implementation of Enigma; Formally proving the Enigma protocol in an academic paper, which should be published soon; Talking with potential users to understand what the most interesting use cases are. “The most interesting use case we're hearing from potential users is the ability to do data science and machine learning on encrypted data sets. Other use cases include private smart contracts and 'IoT with privacy',” Zyskind told Bitcoin Magazine. The Enigma team will be launching a beta soon. Interested users can join the waiting list to participate in the beta by signing up for at the Enigma website. ",

    "title": "In most jurisdictions, security deposits are intended to provide landlords with a financial guaranty against nonpayment of rent or excess",
    "text": "In most jurisdictions, security deposits are intended to provide landlords with a financial guaranty against nonpayment of rent or excess damage to a rental property during tenancy. In the past the primary way to provide this guarantee has been for the tenant to deposit funds, in trust, with the landlord. The landlord takes custody, but not ownership of the funds. The obvious problem is that, aside from ethical and legal obligations, a landlord has no incentive to return a tenant’s security deposit - which is why almost everyone who has been a renter has a “they-didn’t-return-my-security-deposit” story.Custodial security deposits present the same problems as most custodial accounts. Custodial accounts are easy to “borrow” from. In the case of security deposits, the penalties for misuse of funds are comparatively low to the reward of keeping the money and most tenants will not actually sue to recover a deposit. While some jurisdictions require that landlords hold security deposits in a separate account, some don’t. In the end it really doesn’t matter whether the funds are in a separate account or not because they’re controlled solely by the landlord with little, if any, oversight by tenants or anyone else.Unfortunately, many landlords have a standard practice of not returning security deposits regardless of the condition of the premises. When the tenant receives a form notice that they’re not getting their deposit back, they’re faced with two choices: fight or walk away. Often the deposit amount simply isn’t enough to justify taking time away from work, traveling to a jurisdiction where they may no longer live, and presenting evidence before a court where success is never guaranteed. Undocumented residents and those hiding from domestic abusers cannot go to court to recover deposits. Regardless of the reason, many tenants simply walk away. Angry at the landlord. Angry at the system.We can do better.Using bitcoin’s multisignature address feature we can create a 2-of-3 address, where the tenant is a signer, the landlord is a signer, and a trusted disinterested third party holds the third key. In minutes, and from anywhere in the world, the tenant, landlord, and third party can combine public addresses to create a multi-signature address with a 2-of-3 signing configuration. Once the address is created, the tenant funds the address. All parties can verify on the public blockchain, within 10 minutes, that the funding has occurred and within about an hour the landlord can be confident that the funds will be there at the end of the term. Then nothing happens for a year. Or more. The landlord cannot misappropriate funds, as it takes two signers to move funds out of the account. At the end of the lease, the tenant creates a transaction transferring the entire deposit to another tenant-owned address. The tenant sends the transaction to the landlord for signing. If the property is damaged the landlord can send a counter transaction and ask the tenant to sign. The landlord and tenant can then negotiate among themselves. If they cannot reach agreement, they can get the third party signer involved.Alternatively, a transaction can be structured to acknowledge the most common scenario - where there is no damage to the premises and the deposit should be returned in-full to the tenant at the end of the lease. To make the deposit refundable by default, at the beginning of the term, both the landlord and tenant sign a transaction refunding the deposit at a future date. Bitcoin’s nLockTime feature allows them to create a post-dated transaction that cannot be processed before a stated date. By signing an nLockTime transaction, dated for the length of the lease plus 30 days, the landlord will have 30 days to make a claim and get the third party to override the transaction. A time-locked refund transaction shifts the burden of proof to the landlord, who must make a claim and prove damages in order to obtain deposit money. If the landlord and tenant agree to extend the lease, the funds can be relocked with two simple transactions.With or without nLockTime, bitcoin’s multisignature addresses are superior to traditional custodial landlord accounts because they ensure landlords do not unlawfully commingle, keep, or spend the tenant’s funds. It balances the power between the parties and provides public oversight through the network. Importantly, the third party is not involved if the landlord and tenant agree on the refund amount themselves. This keeps costs down and encourages communication. Finally, the parties are still protected by traditional landlord/tenant laws and the third party would be required to follow those laws. This is one example of ensuring due process through technology.So often in fintech we see solutions in search of problems. In this case, technology can quickly, easily, and cheaply solve a real problem for millions of renters. While in the short-term price volatility and the lack of incentive for landlords to adopt this solution may make it less likely to gain widespread adoption, neither minimize its potential. Bitcoin’s built-in multisignature feature can simultaneously protect landlords and tenants while righting the grossly imbalanced power dynamic between the two. With multisig you could actually get your security deposit back in-full without going to court. Imagine that! Photo modified from BTC Keychain / CC BY 2.0",

    "title": "While the Internet has allowed people all around the world to find freelance work at the click of a button,",
    "text": "While the Internet has allowed people all around the world to find freelance work at the click of a button, it also has created a situation where these online workers are sometimes exploited or simply not paid for their work. Microwork.io is a startup that plans to put power back into the hands of the freelancer and allow the poor all over the world to earn a decent wage.Microwork.io founder and CEO Andy Gough recently spoke to Bitcoin Magazine and answered a few questions about his new project. He described how blockchain technology can be used to “free workers all over the world from exploitation and abuse.”Gough’s hopes for Microwork.ioMicrowork.io is best described as a more open variation of Amazon Mechnical Turk. Although most freelancer websites seem to focus on the employer side of the equation, it’s clear that Microwork.io plans to help all of the freelancers in the world who have dealt with dishonest clients in the past.“Workers will always have a voice with us,” Gough said. “We are building our site with input from the workers to determine best practices and processes, and we hope to blaze a trail that will light up millions – and later billions – of the world’s poor to a life without poverty.”Gough also noted that the platform will enforce a minimum wage on all contracts. Many users also may not even realize that bitcoin is being used for payments under the hood.“Our users will mainly have no familiarity with bitcoin and the blockchain, so we also allow users to have their tasks deposit money directly in their bank accounts or some other method,” Gough said. “For example, our users in the Philippines can select a smart task, do the work, and then the money will be deposited directly in their bank account as pesos. These users need not know that bitcoin is invoked, which we feel is crucial to onboard the 99 percent.”Full verification of work via smart contractsPerhaps the most innovative, and somewhat sci-fi, feature of Microwork.io is the ability to finalize contracts without the help of a third party. Although it obviously will not work for every type of job posted on the platform, there are certain tasks that can be confirmed via smart contracts checking the status of a certain data feed on the Internet. For example, a smart contract can check to see if a specific type of code has been added to a GitHub repository or a tweet has been sent out by a specific Twitter account.With these sorts of “smart tasks,” the completion of certain projects can be verified via a smart contract oracle system rather than a subjective third party. This feature has the potential to help workers avoid online jobs where the employer decides to not pay an employee after the work has been completed.Microwork.io also will have an arbitration section for jobs that are unable to be completely verified via a smart contract. Gough was able to explain what would happen in a situation where the two parties on a contract disagree on the outcome of the project:“When this happens, the original smart task spawns a predefined number of other arbitration smart tasks, which can then be picked up by members of the community,” he said. “Arbitration smart tasks employ users to examine the original smart task requirements and vote to determine if the terms of the contract have been filled or not. These new contracts are funded by a percentage of the original smart task’s funds.”Bitcoin for payments, Thelonious for reputation, and Codius for smart contractsMicrowork.io takes advantage of a variety of technologies in the blockchain ecosystem to create their market for smart tasks. Bitcoin is the only option for payments at this time, although (as mentioned above) many users will not even notice that bitcoin is being used behind the scenes.A customized Thelonious blockchain is used for Microwork.io’s reputation system. Thelonious is a blockchain platform built by Eris Industries that was originally based on the Ethereum blockchain. The high level of customization offered by Thelonious made it the right choice for Microwork.io during the development process. As Gough noted, “Thelonious was used because at that time it was the only blockchain designer that could do what I wanted, but, as you know, bitcoin moves fast.”Codius, which is developed by Ripple Labs, is the platform where the smart contracts are processed, but this could eventually change. Gough noted, “We hope to use Ethereum in the future.”Microwork.io is currently seeking seed funding in order to bring their vision to as many people around the world as possible.",

    "text": "Once More for Posterity: Dorian Nakamoto Explains Why He Is Not the Mastermind Behind the World’s Most Popular Digital CurrencyApproaching the home that Dorian Nakamoto shares with his 93-year-old mother in the small Los Angeles County suburb of Temple City, one beholds a posted note under the doorbell declaring, “Private property: No solicitors or reporters.” Though I have come as an invited guest, the note stands as a stark reminder of the peculiar form of hell Nakamoto endured just a year and a half ago, when he was hounded to distraction by hordes of media and various curiosity-seekers after Newsweek magazine published a purported exposé that dubbed him the “Father of Bitcoin.” The claim fell like a bomb on those who follow Bitcoin, and given Newsweek ’s longtime status as a paragon of mass magazine journalism, it engendered widespread discussion. The article, by Leah McGrath Goodman, served as the magazine’s cover story on March 6, 2014. It claimed to have uncovered the true identity of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, following a two-month investigation that included “interviews with those closest to (Dorian) Nakamoto and the developers who worked most frequently with him (“Satoshi”).Citing Dorian’s past contracting work on top-secret engineering projects, an ingrained disdain for government intrusion, and using quotes from various family members which paint him as a humble, privacy-obsessed engineering mastermind, Goodman made a compelling though surface-level argument for Dorian Nakamoto as the creator of Bitcoin. But following the article’s publication, most involved with Bitcoin were quick to question the validity of Goodman’s claims, seeing the evidence presented as largely circumstantial. A commonly held belief among those who are skeptical of Newsweek ’s claims is that “Satoshi Nakamoto” is actually an alias for a group of cryptographers/software engineers, rather than an individual. Others who corresponded with “Satoshi,” including core developer Gavin Andresen, believe he is in fact an individual.Furthermore, a recent piece by Nathaniel Popper in The New York Times makes the case that if the creator was indeed an individual, he was probably BitGold inventor and noted cryptocurrency expert Nick Szabo, not Dorian Nakamoto (although Szabo, too, refutes these claims). Still others have asked the logical question of why a humble and essentially private person such as Dorian Nakamoto would create Bitcoin, seek anonymity for that feat, and then choose an alias that includes his given last name, in light of all of the other measures he took to remain anonymous.Mike Hearn, a developer who communicated with Satoshi prior to his departure from Bitcoin, even posted a blog entry that charted logical inconsistencies within Goodman’s claim that Dorian Nakamoto and Satoshi Nakamoto are one and the same. Trial By Media FireThe Newsweek story revealed sensitive details about Dorian Nakamoto in an effort to highlight personality traits and motivations that fall in line with what little there is to infer about Bitcoin’s creator. It ended up turning his world upside down.In the midst of an unwanted media blitz that included what he describes as being unable to grab milk from the store without being barraged by reporters, Nakamoto gained support from lawyers and individuals in the Bitcoin community. One group even created the short-lived website “newsweeklied.com” that was intended to clear his name and raise funds for a lawsuit against the publication giant. In a statement formally submitted to Newsweek by Nakamoto and his lawyer, he states that he “did not create, invent or otherwise work on Bitcoin,” and that, “Newsweek ’s false report has been the source of a great deal of confusion and stress for myself, my 93-year-old mother, my siblings, and their families.” He then ends the letter: “This will be our last public statement on this matter. I ask that you now respect our privacy.”Given the definitive nature of that statement, I ask Dorian why he now desires to speak to the press. His simple answer: “Closure.” Cookies and CourtlinessAs we enter Nakamoto’s home, he leads me into the kitchen, where the table is neatly set with woven placemats, a Japanese style tea set and a box of chocolate chip cookies. It is immediately apparent that Nakamoto, 65, a bachelor with a past marriage and grown children on his family resume, may not regularly entertain new guests in such a quasi-formal setting, but he has his own sense of how to go about doing so. He exudes a kind of courtliness, reverence and respect for the occasion that young people today would likely describe as “old-fashioned.” As I take my seat, he is quick to offer and pour me green tea, then proceeds to make sure that I am content and comfortable in a way that feels refreshingly sincere. Not drinking any tea himself, he settles into his seat and begins to form circles around the empty cup with his fingers. Far from the shrewd, eccentric man portrayed in the Newsweek piece, he appears much more as a kind and good-humored person, with an almost canonical approach to respect and hospitality. After an exchange of additional basic pleasantries, he chuckles to himself and says in his slow, deep voice, “OK. Ask me anything.” At the crux of Newsweek ’s claim that Nakamoto is in fact the creator of Bitcoin is a brief exchange between Goodman and him, in which Goodman states that he “tacitly” acknowledged his role in the Bitcoin project by declaring to her: “I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It’s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.”The words “no longer involved” and “turned over” would seem to lend credence to the belief that Nakamoto was in fact involved in some capacity with the “Bitcoin project.” I ask him about this exchange specifically, seeking to gain some clarity on his response. He replies: “I was thinking about work I had done at Citibank that was security things, security exchange. Even if I was involved I can’t tell you, because every engineering firm makes you sign a nondisclosure contract for during and post. I thought maybe that [her question] was something to do with Citibank work that I did.”This response provides potential clarity surrounding this pivotal exchange between Goodman and Nakamoto. He insists he was not even familiar with the term “Bitcoin” at the time of the Newsweek interview, and thought Goodman was referring to a project that he had worked on at Citibank. Why, at the time, he drew this conclusion about the connection between “Bitcoin” and his previous, confidential work for Citi is still not entirely clear. The Case for and AgainstThe Newsweek piece emphasizes: “Perhaps the most compelling parallel between the two Nakamotos are their professional skill sets and career timeframes.” While portrayals of work on classified military projects are commonly projected with an almost clichéd, sinister tone, Nakamoto’s’s reasons for the life of secrecy described by his family are far more practical than they are mysterious. In addition to the nondisclosure agreements he signs with each classified project, and his firm belief in abiding by what he describes as the “engineer’s code,” he also emphasizes that it is extremely advantageous for people in his line of work to be as private as possible in order to best preserve their job security. In this and his other responses, it is clear that Nakamoto has the mind of an engineer, articulating each of his carefully constructed thoughts piece by piece, and attending to even the most seemingly minute details. Noting the measures that his employers take to ensure that contractors will not be motivated to exchange classified information for rewards, he explains how anything from debt to a troubled relative or an affair (remember David Petraeus’s exit from the CIA?) would be grounds for immediate removal, and likely result in permanent exclusion from classified projects.He notes that since publication of the Newsweek article, which exposed many personal details including sensitive information about his health and finances, he has been effectively “blacklisted” from the types of engineering jobs that he has worked on throughout his professional career. Respect for the “Bitcoin Creator”While the unwanted association with Bitcoin has brought significant hardship and stress to Nakamoto’s life, he brightens and is eager to thank the Bitcoin community for their “support.” He then expresses appreciation toward the “creator” for bringing Bitcoin’s blockchain technology to the world. “The more I study about it, I think it’s a fantastic idea. I really appreciate what he [Satoshi Nakamoto] did, and all the people who contributed, including [Bitcoin core developer Gavin] Andresen and Andreas [M. Antonopoulos, Bitcoin entrepreneur and security expert].”Warming to his topic, he continues: “And then the free software, freeware–that is a brilliant idea on the part of this creator or group of creators. But you also need very talented people to implement and carry it out; also marketing, sales. I just feel when I looked at it, I said ‘Wow! This is a beautiful thing.’ Especially if you are anti-authority or anti-establishment, which would be banks and governments and things like that. And they [Bitcoin] have a hold of young people now, including Jeffrey right here! “I’d like to see how Bitcoin evolves into the next stage. How it encounters this problem, I won’t say problem, but government is always trying to encroach. Same thing with banks. And we will have to withstand the storm of what’s going to happen to our dollars as the international standard exchange currency….The biggest thing is we can’t possibly pay,” he says, in reference to the American debt. “My hope is that the top level designers, the creators, think about that.” I am astonished to hear that Nakamoto has such high praise for the technology, and moreover, that he has clearly thought about how it should evolve, drawing on the nuances of the economic implications surrounding a decentralized currency/monetary system, and in light of the current geopolitical environment.Riding Toward a Powerful FutureNakamoto’s car, a faded beige Toyota Corolla, which “still runs great” after having logged almost 200,000 miles on the odometer, is not his preferred method of transportation. Driving to grab some Chinese food in Temple City, he points out the flawed street design and cracked sidewalks that obstruct his frequent bike rides around town.Chuckling as he explains what he sees as simple solutions to basic infrastructure problems, he notes the pleasure and peace he finds in his regular bicycle rides, smiling as he recounts past excursions through the San Gabriel foothills and on the banks of the Los Angeles River. (Yes, there is such a thing, but it is mostly a wide concrete channel traversing the L.A. basin.)In his New York Times piece, Popper states, “At this point, the creator’s identity is no longer important to Bitcoin’s future.” While most Bitcoin observers would likely believe this to be true, it is also clear that the unique mindset, convictions and motivations that governed “Satoshi’s” approach have had a meaningful, lasting effect on the enterprise, and they warrant examination. In this regard, Satoshi Nakamoto becomes more than the “genius” (or geniuses) who created Bitcoin—he also created Bitcoin, took no credit, and left the fortune amassed by his own creation completely untouched, all in order to best preserve the purity of a powerful idea. And that is a world-changing thing, quite likely unique in human history.It is almost impossible for most of us to imagine a person or group who would have both the technical skill set to create Bitcoin and the ability to faithfully execute on such selfless principles. This draws us to figures like Nick Szabo and Dorian Nakamoto. Both men’s personalities and beliefs align with the characteristics that make Satoshi Nakamoto such a uniquely compelling figure. While such investigations are, for these reasons, entertaining and thought-provoking, they do clearly affect—in Dorian’s case, severely affect—the individuals under examination. Moreover, such attempts to unveil the creator’s identity go against (what appears to be) Satoshi’s desire for Bitcoin to evolve as a truly inclusive open source project, in which the actual identity of its creator is ultimately unimportant.With all that said, I am glad I was able to spend a day with Dorian Nakamoto in Temple City. I hope that this account will shed some light on Newsweek ’s so-called “Father of Bitcoin,” and perhaps help provide him with the closure that he seeks. If so, it couldn’t happen to a more humble guy.***Postscript: After learning of Dorian’s financial complications, his friend cryptograffiti created a piece of artwork that will be auctioned off with 100 of the proceeds going to Dorian. The artwork is also signed by Dorian, who will be conducting an AMA on Reddit later this week. The auction will be accepting bitcoin exclusively and will run until October 15th , 2015 at 7pm PST.

    "text": "During his talk at IDX Derivatives Expo in London, Alex Batlin, Director in UBS's technology innovation, research and development team shed some light on what the financial institution has been working on in their innovation lab: smart-bonds on the Bitcoin blockchain.International Financing Review Asia (IFR Asia) reported that the smart-bonds were described by Batlin as bonds where “risk-free interest rates and payment streams were fully automated, creating a self-paying instrument.”“The key attraction is that there is no middle or back office, and no registry, so clearly a major impact on costs,” said Batlin.The Innovation LabSmart-bonds are one of the first publicly confirmed technologies the Swiss banking giant is said to be exploring since the launch of The innovation Lab in April to explore how blockchain technologies could improve the banking sector. The creation of the lab came after the publishing of an extensive report about the benefits of the blockchain by the international bank.When the report was published, UBS Group CIO Oliver Bussmann told the Wall Street Journal, “I believe – and this is my personal view – that blockchain technology will not only change the way we do payments, but it will change the whole trading and settlement topic.”Since then, that hypothesis has begun to get some traction as the Nasdaq OMX Group began experimenting with a pilot of blockchain technology as a record-keeping ledger for the Nasdaq Private Market, a small market launched in 2014 to handle the trading of shares belonging to private companies.Smart-bonds likely is just one of several technological applications of blockchains UBS’ lab is exploring. The lab, which is located in the London offices of European fintech startup accelerator Level39, is meant to spur new innovations that can bolster the bank’s long-term growth.“Blockchain technologies can make banks more efficient – for example, through instantaneous settlement rather than the days it takes at present, lower costs and lower operational risk,” said Batlin during the IDX Derivatives Expo in London. “The simple lesson for banks is that if we don’t do it someone else will.”Difficulties remainBitcoin’s proof-of-work mining algorithm is responsible for the digital currency’s unique characteristics of network security and decentralization, but as Batlin pointed out, it is also causes the system to be slow and expensive. Transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain often take a hour or move and require large amounts of electricity via miners who verify transactions. These hurdles eliminate the possibility of high-frequency or algorithmic trading, as least as it currently stands.“All kinds of revenue opportunities can emerge,” said Batlin speaking of how these innovations could be monetized, “but it’s still more expensive, so there is a way to go.” “UBS sign” by twicepix / CC BY-SA 2.0",

    "text": "Roughly nine months ago, Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen made a rather interesting comment on Reddit in which he claimed, “I suspect many [cloud mining companies] will turn out to be Ponzi schemes.”There have been a few cloud mining scams uncovered over the past year or two, and it appears that another one could unravel in the near future. An anonymous source has provided information to Bitcoin Magazine regarding the possibility of a Bitcoin cloud mining ponzi scheme involving Bitcoin Cloud Services (BCS), which is currently one of the largest cloud-mining providers on the market.Founded by a known scammer with PhotoshopOne of the common attributes of a Ponzi scheme in the Bitcoin world is a reliance on anonymous owners. BTC Cloud Services LTD is registered to Gabriel Kleiman and Esteban Amador Soto Martinez.While the first name does not bring up any identifying information online, the second name is associated with another bitcoin-related scam, bitcoincloudhashing.com. This information is available publicly on the bitcointalk forums thanks to Puppet’s Cloudmining 101 thread, but it hasn't stopped an estimated 4,300 users from signing up at Bitcoin Cloud Services. BCS also claims to be a silver member of the Bitcoin Foundation on their website, even though the foundation recently dropped the cloud mining company as a sponsor.Further, the pictures of a supposed mining facility on the Bitcoin Cloud Services website contain no information about the mining facility or its owners besides a single banner hanging in the background. Compare to the photo below from Genesis Mining showing CEO Marco Streng in one of the company's mining farms.Editor's Note: This photo of Genesis Mining CEO Marco Streng is provided courtesy of Genesis Mining and provided for comparison and reference only. Genesis Mining is not connected to Bitcoin Cloud Services in any way.The “company” also released a poorly made video based off the Photoshopped images in an effort to bring more legitimacy to their activities:The supporting evidence on the blockchainOne of the key pieces of data provided by the anonymous source is a spreadsheet compiled via publicly available data on the Bitcoin blockchain but we do not know the specific bitcoin mining software used. By watching Bitcoin Cloud Services’ payout address, the anonymous source was able to estimate the number of customers receiving payouts, along with BCS’s profits and losses. BCS seems to have started to operate at a loss near the end of April. How did BCS respond? By offering an extra year on their currently available mining contracts. Typical behavior of a Bitcoin cloud mining ponzi scheme.This offer could be an attempt to keep a Ponzi scheme going for as long as possible. After all, it will last only as long as new money is coming in. The back-of-the-envelope math based on the spreadsheet indicates that the operators could run off with as much as 2,500 BTC ($570,000 at current prices) with a bitcoin mining scam.If it looks like a duck...Going back to Puppet’s Cloud Mining 101 thread, it seems clear that he understands the likelihood that BCS is a Ponzi scheme. The thread lists seven different criteria that are usually found in a Ponzi scheme, and BCS fits the bill in six out of seven criteria. The only test that BCS seems to have passed is having pictures of their mining facility on their website. Of course, as Puppet notes in his thread, “Pictures can be faked.” This seems to be what has happened in the case of Bitcoin Cloud Services. Puppet currently has BCS listed under “Likely Ponzi scams that have yet to collapse,” and it’s unclear how long BCS will be able to keep up the charade. Up to this point, Puppet has been correct with 95 percent of his calls of a probable Bitcoin cloud mining ponzi scheme. Bitcoin Magazine has reached out to BCS for comment.",

    "text": "The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) started review of a draft Web Payments Working Group Charter. The Web Payments Working Group will launch by the end of September after the end of the review on September 15, start working on an overall Web payments architecture, and prepare key topics for discussion at the next Technical Plenary/Advisory Committee meeting (TPAC 2015) in October.The W3C, led by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, is an international body that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the Web. The Web Payments Interest Group acts as the overall coordinator at W3C of avision for Web Payments.“The Web Payments Working Group is not creating any new digital payment schemes, but rather integrating existing and emerging schemes more efficiently and securely into Web applications,” states the W3C announcement. “A standardized message flow should make it easier to automate payments, which will improve the overall security and user experience of making payments on the Web.”The Web Payments Interest Group recently updated its Web Payments Use Cases 1.0 working draft. The Group also published a FAQ with more information about the anticipated benefits of the future standards, a diagram illustrating the high-level message flow, and some examples of different Web payment approaches.The W3C Web Payments documentation makes only sparse references to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, which are only mentioned as possible options alongside other online payment means such as Google Wallet, Apple Pay, PayPal and iDEAL, a payment method that enables consumers to pay online through their own banks. The Use Cases draft includes a short section dedicated to cryptocurrency payments with bitcoin and ripple, with a scenario that outlines an ideal payment experience using bitcoin, or a bitcoin-like cryptocurrency.Internet pioneers such as Ted Nelson, Marc Andreessen and Berners-Lee himself thought that the Internet should have a built-in framework for micropayments. Berners-Lee tried to include micropayments in Web protocols, but the idea hasn’t been implemented so far.“In the late 1990s Berners-Lee tried to develop a micropayments system for the Web through the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),” reported Walter Isaacson in his 2014 book “The Innovators: How a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution.” The idea was to devise a way to embed in a Web page the information needed to handle a small payment, which would allow different electronic wallet services to be created by banks or entrepreneurs. “It was never implemented, partly because of the changing complexity of banking regulations,” noted Isaacson.The preparatory work of the Web Payments Interest Group and the forthcoming work of the Web Payments Working Group can be seen as gradual steps to implement Berners-Lee’s vision. However, it’s surprising that the official W3C documents produced to date make only incidental mentions of bitcoin, which is the only form of Internet money and “Internet native” payment system that exists, works, effectively implements one-click Internet payments, and is rapidly gaining recognition and partial acceptance from the financial system.Isaacson reports that Andreessen mentioned bitcoin as a good model for standard Internet payment systems. “If I had a time machine and could go back to 1993, one thing I’d do for sure would be to build in bitcoin or some similar form of cryptocurrency,” Andreessen said.A possible explanation for the more timid approach of the W3C is that the organization prefers to distance itself from the more controversial aspects of bitcoin, including the possibility of private and semi-anonymous transactions, and wait for “sanitized” versions of bitcoin.Photo Southbank Centre / Flickr (CC)",

    "text": "Bitcoin investment fund Bitcoin Capital has raised more than $1 million on the equity crowdfunding platform Bnk To The Future, SiliconANGLEreports. At the time of writing, almost 600 investors have bought in, with three days to go until the end of the fundraiser. Fifty percent equity will be split between the investors.Bitcoin Capital, a high-risk, high-return fund, is run by renowned financial journalist Max Keiser and Simon Dixon, co-founder of Bnk To The Future, an online investment website for crowdfunding small businesses mainly focused on financial innovation. The fund, open to qualified investors who want to speculate on the growth of the cryptocurrency sector, offers a spread of investments covering startups, bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency trading. Each of the three investment lines will have one-third of the fund invested into it.“Max Keiser has a consistent record of presciently and profitably identifying big trends. He was one of the few media personalities to devote significant coverage to us early Bitcoin evangelists. Watching his new fund's performance will be very interesting,” said early bitcoin investor and Host of the Bitcoin Knowledge PodcastTrace Mayer.“Bitcoin Capital is a Cayman Islands tax efficient investment fund for professional investors who want exposure to the growth of Crypto Currencies like Bitcoin and Blockchain technology,” states the Bitcoin Capital website. “One-third of the fund invests in companies in the Crypto Currency and Blockchain sector. For earlier stage startups we have created a completely new model for finding deals to invest in. The startup must first raise finance through CrowdFunding on StartJOIN.com, qualify for Equity CrowdFunding on BnkToTheFuture.com and reach at least 50 of their funding goal from investors before they qualify for Bitcoin Capital to explore investing. They have to prove their traction with the crowd before we explore the Investment proposition.”Besides seed funding to blockchain startups, Bitcoin Capital invests one-third of all funds in mining, which is used exclusively to pay daily dividends to investors (in bitcoin) for as long as the mining process is profitable. The remaining third of the fund is invested in cryptocurrencies and digital tokens.“We invest in longer term growth coins where we believe in the story rather than short term coin speculation,” notes the website.“At the same time as investors benefiting from any growth of the sector, we are able to offer investors daily dividend determined by the mining process,” said Dixon. “We are able to do all the geeky things like running mining rigs in Iceland and buying coins on exchanges that investors who are new to the sector are unable to do. Thanks to our experience and involvement in the sector from very early on we are able to combine these new models of finance together.”Keiser hosts Keiser Report, a financial program broadcast on Russian state media channel RT, a weekly show about finance and markets on London's Resonance FM, and writes for The Huffington Post. An outspoken Bitcoin activist, Keiser stated in an interview that he would base the entire economy on the digital currency.“I have been critical of the traditional financial system for many years on my show,” said Keiser. “I was the first global news outlet to cover bitcoin when it was trading at $3, recognizing its potential to change the world. Many startups in the Bitcoin space credit Keiser Report for getting them started in the business. Bitcoin Capital allows the founders and investors to experiment with new crypto financial business models and currencies to transform global finance.”",

    "title": "Indonesia, one of the world’s most beautiful archipelagoes and travel destinations, has had a consistent increase in bitcoin adoption at",
    "text": "Indonesia, one of the world’s most beautiful archipelagoes and travel destinations, has had a consistent increase in bitcoin adoption at popular tourist spots including Bali, Jakarta and Denpasar, since the launch of BitIslands in March 2014.Initiated by the largest Indonesian Bitcoin exchange Bitcoin Indonesia, the project was sponsored by leading Bitcoin merchant platforms and mobile services in Asia, including a Singaporean startup Coin of Sale, Artabit, CoinPip, Quantified, Tukarcash and Bitwyre. Since 2014, Bitcoin Indonesia continued to aggressively push the project in Bali, where BitIslands launched a bitcoin Information Center and Bali’s first offline Bitcoin exchange.Due to the increase of bitcoin’s market awareness and merchant adoption, the majority of the locals started to use bitcoin online, and began to appreciate bitcoin’s low transaction fees and speed, The Wall Street Journal reports.“Most Indonesians currently use bitcoin to pay for services online, such as web hosting. They can also use the digital currency to book hotel rooms through travel websites hosted overseas rather than use credit cards, which only a small percentage of the population currently own,” the Journal article says.Furthermore, major bitcoin exchanges such as Bitcoin Indonesia have seen a substantial growth in both the number of users and daily trading volumes. The largest bitcoin exchange in Indonesia currently trades around 200 bitcoin daily and supports more than 56,000 users.“Many people think that Bitcoin is unheard of in Indonesia, but the fact is its popularity is soaring now,” Bitcoin Indonesia CEO Oscar Darmawan said.In September 2014, several projects emerged to increase bitcoin mainstream adoption in the nation, by allowing Indonesian residents to purchase bitcoin at popular stores or tourist spots. The project ran by Bitcoin Indonesia enabled users of its exchange to purchase bitcoin at any of the 10,000 Indomarket convenience stores via a partnership with iPaymu, a merchant payment platform.Such services, along with the rising volume of Bitcoin exchanges, influenced Indonesian merchants to accept bitcoin in other parts of Indonesia apart from Bali, where most of the Bitcoin projects began. Currently, Indonesia has more than 50 Bitcoin merchants, and the majority are located in Denpasar.Rise of Bitcoin StartupsSince early 2015, some Bitcoin startups began to relocate to Indonesia, targeting the poor banking systems and payment infrastructure of the country. One of the startups was Blossom, which recently moved from San Francisco to Indonesia to offer the country’s first bitcoin-based global lending/investing platform.Blossom connects international investors to small businesses in Indonesia which are ready to launch. Through an established local microfinance institution, Blossom delivers the bitcoin funds to the businesses. After 12 months, profits from the businesses are collected to be distributed to the investors, with around 7.5 percent to 12.5 percent in return.“In conventional investment, I have to rely on the statements and numbers publicized by my partners. With Bitcoin, it’s clear to everyone what’s going on,” said founder Matthew Martin.As the number of bitcoin merchants and trading volumes continue to grow at a consistent rate, Bitcoin startups and establishments, including Bitcoin Indonesia, aim to achieve mainstream bitcoin adoption in popular tourist spots in the country.",

    "text": "XBT Provider AB announced today the authorization of Bitcoin Tracker One, the first bitcoin-based security available on a regulated exchange, Bloomberg reports.Bitcoin Tracker One is an “Exchange Traded Note” (ETN) designed to provide investors with convenient access to the returns of the underlying asset, U.S. dollar (USD) per bitcoin, less investor fees. Bitcoin Tracker One is authorized by Sweden’s financial supervisory authority, and will be admitted to trading on Nasdaq Stockholm. The average dollar exchange rate of bitcoin from the most liquid exchanges provides the underlying reference price. The first day of trading is expected to be May 18th, 2015.“We are proud to offer the world’s first “Bitcoin tracker” to be traded on a regulated exchange,” said Alexander Marsh, Chief Executive Officer of XBT Provider. “By enabling this easy and secure way to invest in Bitcoin we hope to have eliminated the boundaries that earlier prevented individuals and companies from being able to actively invest in what we believe to be the future of money.”“These are exciting times for the Bitcoin ecosystem,” said Board member Staffan Helgesson. “Bitcoin Tracker One will be the world’s first financial instrument that provides consumers and institutions the possibility to invest in bitcoins without holding coins themselves.”The Bitcoin Tracker One Prospectus, which has been approved by the Swedish FSA, currently is available only in Swedish. XTB Provider AB will hedge all sales of the bitcoin-traded note by buying an equal value in the bitcoin market. A spokesperson for Nasdaq confirmed to CoinDesk that XBT Provider had been approved as a certificate issuer and that its product was the first bitcoin-based item to be listed on the Swedish exchange.Market maker Mangold Fondkommission, a Stockholm-based brokerage and investment bank, will assist XBT Provider with clearing services and acts as a liquidity provider for Bitcoin Tracker One.The XBT Provider website states that the company is aiming to attract additional liquidity providers to the order book going forward to complement the natural flow of orders. The goal is offering a liquid market with a small spread, making the instrument attractive for all type of investors.Bitcoin Tracker One is the latest addition to the growing number of bitcoin investment vehicles that aim to expand bitcoin investments beyond the volatile spot exchanges and attract traditional investors who prefer not to trade bitcoin as currency because they are scared by bitcoin’s wild price swings. Bitcoin Tracker One could become an interesting option for those traditional investors who are persuaded that the dollar exchange rate of bitcoin will rise in the mid- and long term, but prefer not to hold bitcoin directly.Other similar bitcoin investment vehicles are Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), which received formal approval for listing on the OTC Markets Group’s OTCQX exchange with the symbol GBTC, and the upcoming Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), which will be available to investors on NASDAQ with the ticker COIN.XBT Provider AB (publ) is a public limited liability company formed in Sweden and incorporated under Swedish law, with statutory seat in Stockholm. The XBT Provider website states that the company is backed and guaranteed by KnCGroup, a bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer and service provider that has been targeted by a recent class action lawsuit.Photo by TS Eriksson / CC BY 3.0",

    "text": "Leading bitcoin exchange and wallet provider Coinbase has expanded its services to Canada and Singapore as a part of its project to expand their services globally. Now, consumers in Singapore are able to buy and sell bitcoin for Singapore dollars through Coinbase.This follows the company’s announcement from ealier this week that Coinbase users based in Canada will be able to buy and sell bitcoin with Canadian dollars instantly, using the Coinbase Wallet. Additionally, users will be able to buy and sell bitcoin with a Canadian bank account directly and trade BTC/CAD on Coinbase’s exchange.“Our mission at Coinbase is to spur mainstream bitcoin adoption, which we’ve set out to achieve by providing people with a simple, secure on-ramp to the bitcoin world,” Sam Rosenblum, international expansion lead at Coinbase told Bitcoin Magazine. “By expanding our wallet and exchange services to Canada, we’re getting bitcoin into the hands of even more people globally and, by extension, helping to drive growth of the entire Bitcoin network.”As a celebration for the expansion of their services to Canada, Coinbase will waive conversion fees for Canadian customers until September 9.“To celebrate the launch, Coinbase will waive its retail conversion fees for Canadian customers of the direct buy/sell service, available at Coinbase.com, through September 6 (11:59 Pacific time). Standard trading fees on Coinbase Exchange apply,” the Coinbase team announced.Hackathon and PlansAlong with the announcement, Coinbase also has announced its plans to sponsor a hackathon at the University of Waterloo called “Hack the North hackathon.” As a commemoration of their expansion, Coinbase will award the group that best integrates and implements the API of Coinbase with US$1,000 in bitcoin and guaranteed interviews for an engineering internship at the company.Coinbase has always been a keen supporter of bitcoin and blockchain hackathons worldwide. To date, it has sponsored multiple blockchain hackathons and offered prizes in bitcoin and participated as panelists and mentors.The company also has recently begun to host its own bitcoin hackathons, dedicated for developers hoping to build innovative applications with bitcoin.“We’re interested to see apps which highlight new use cases for Bitcoin, making bitcoin easier to use for wider audiences,” the Coinbase team announced.The winner of the company’s second global hackathon, Mailman, received more than US$70,000 worth of prizes, US$10,000 of bitcoin and a guaranteed place at bitcoin- and virtual reality-focused Boost VC’s accelerator class. Mailman is an email paywall system which allows users to reward timely replies with bitcoin and filter spam using the blockchain, which Coinbase believes “taps into a core benefit of Bitcoin: permissionless innovation.”Similar to its efforts for its own bitcoin hackathons and other competitions it has sponsored so far, Coinbase plans to actively assist Bitcoin startups in Canada by financing bitcoin hackathons in Canada, and by making it easier for Canadian merchants and bitcoin users to purchase and sell bitcoin easily.Initially, the company decided to launch its bitcoin exchange to nine of the provinces in Canada, as their blog post reads: “Users in all Canadian provinces will have the ability to buy and sell bitcoin with CAD using the Coinbase Wallet, and those in 9 of 10 Canadian provinces can begin trading on Coinbase Exchange using the BTC/CAD currency pair.” However, James Watkins of Coinbase told Bitcoin Magazine, “We’ll be launching Coinbase Exchange nationwide on Monday as well.”",

    "text": "Coinbase users can now send bitcoin payments without being exposed to the digital currency’s volatility.Users with a fiat wallet (must be verified in order to get it) allows use of Bitcoin’s global payment network without being exposed to the price of the digital currency. Coinbase’s Instant Exchange deducts an equal amount to the bitcoin the user wants to send, effectively exchanging the two. The service is similar to one offered by Coinbase to bitcoin-accepting merchants.As of today, Instant Exchange is available for users with a USD, EUR, or GBP wallet. After typing the bitcoin address and chosing a fiat wallet, users can hit the “Instant Exchange” button, and then send. A bitcoin amount equal to the fiat selected will be sent instantly, without exposing the user to bitcoin’s notorious volatility. The startup’s standard conversion fee of 15 cents will be deducted from each conversion, but sending payments to other Coinbase users is free.The bitcoin is deducted from the user’s fiat wallet and not his or her digital currency wallet, meaning it can also serve as a way for users to instantly sell their bitcoin.A different modelVolatility is a problem all too well-known in Bitcoin and is a chief complaint among people interested in using the technology’s payment network. Many services have looked to solve this problem by offering the ability to “lock” bitcoin to the price of the American dollar, British pound, and various other fiat currencies. Users can then unlock their bitcoin when they want to send them or be exposed to the digital currency’s price.Latin American bitcoin startup Coinapult was first to launch such a service, but now many bitcoin businesses offer it, including Bitreserve, which designed its whole service around the concept.One issue with these services is that though it makes storing the currency safer, it does not solve the problem when sending the digital currency. Also, if bitcoin’s price goes down, these businesses offering the ability to peg bitcoin will lose money. And though the price has been more stable in recent months, bitcoin’s price has declined dramatically over the last year, meaning that many “lock” services could be feeling some pain.Coinbase’s model avoids the potential risk of being on the strong side of a price swing by exchanging bitcoin for dollars instantly, and not operating a one-to-one reserve (peg).",

    "text": "TigerDirect, an online retailer of computers and consumer electronics has been accepting bitcoin for 18 months through BitPay, beginning in January of 2014.Bitcoin Magazine sat down with Steven Leeds, head of marketing at TigerDirect to learn more about the company’s experience as one of the earliest major merchants to embrace Bitcoin. While recent reports from Expedia suggest that it has seen a decrease in bitcoin payments, TigerDirect shared a different story.According to Leeds, TigerDirect has been thrilled with its decision to accept bitcoin. Leeds noted that Bitcoin has drawn new users to TigerDirect, with 46 percent of customers purchasing with bitcoin being new users. The company also told Bitcoin Magazine that the average order placed with bitcoin is 30 percent larger than the average order.Leeds explained that TigerDirect sees the highest volume of bitcoin orders during periods of volatility for bitcoin price. These purchases are typically luxury items such as high-definition TVs, gaming consoles and computer monitors.“On days when the price is rising, we see users eager to spend some of their newfound wealth. And when the price begins falling, we see others who want to avoid the volatility by spending it on consumer electronics,” said Leeds.Despite the fall of the bitcoin price into the $200s, TigerDirect has still seen consistent bitcoin transaction volume.Advantages for Bitcoin CompaniesIn addition to it’s consumer electronics business, TigerDirect also supplies hardware to many businesses, including a significant number of Bitcoin companies. Some of these companies include miners who use TigerDirect to buy power supplies, cooling systems and other hardware. These miners do not have to convert their bitcoin to cash, as they can pay directly with the bitcoin that they have mined.TigerDirect was originally introduced to Bitcoin by some of it’s employees who were early adopters and miners of the currency.“We’d recommend Bitcoin to any company considering it,” Leeds said. “We’ve had a fantastic experience accepting it, and BitPay allows us to integrate the payments into our existing checkout flow easily.”",

    "text": "Bitmain, the Bitcoin mining ASIC provider, Sunday announced the release of its next-generation Bitcoin miner, the Antminer S7, using the recently announced BM1385 ASIC.The company argues that “this machine is not only our most efficient ever, using less than half the energy per gigahash of the S5, but it is also our most powerful miner to enter mass production.” It had released the S5+ in limited supply, which offers nearly 3,000 more GH/s than the announced S7.“It’s true that the S5+ had a greater overall hashrate, but the S7 squeezes more juice from a smaller, more power efficient package,” said Jake Smith, Bitmain’s head of North America, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “When comparing hashrate to weight, size, or power consumption, the S7 comes out ahead.”The Antminer S7 is a denser mining rig than previous models. Whereas the S5 used 60 chips per miner, the Antminer S7 uses 162 of the BM1385 chips. Each S7 will be able to generate upwards of 4,850 GH/s while only needing approximately 0.25 J/GH of power.Part of the reason the chip is so much stronger is because the company went away from using standard design flow methods. “From the BM1385 onwards, we’ll be using full-custom design flow,” Smith explained. While full-custom design flow is more work intensive and does have a greater margin of error, it results in greater efficiency, which is where profit can be found.“It’s difficult to predict the how long our new chip will take to bring to market, but development on our next chip began almost as soon as this one was completed. Our next chip, the BM1387, will be our second full-custom chip, and our first chip built on a 16-nanometer process node,” Smith said.With each new chip released miners have to weigh their options on whether to upgrade. Smith said that there has been considerable interest in the S7 by current Bitmain miners, in particular because older hardware may become obsolete. “The inevitable large deployment of S7s will cause network hashrate to rise and some older hardware to be forced offline. More recent hardware like the S5 will still be profitable, but to a lower degree than at present,” Smith said.‘We’ll continue to make our machines available to Joe Miner …’Bitmain has deployed a different strategy than other Bitcoin hardware companies has. Other companies have focused their development efforts on creating miners for internal use rather than widespread adoption. For example, Bitcoin Shop (BTCS) announced that it would be merging with Spondoolies-Tech, which would give BTCS access to Spondoolies’ latest miner to give it a competitive advantage. Bitmain, on the other hand, continues to sell its hardware to the general population.“We’re very strong believers in keeping Bitcoin decentralized. Until recently, most mining was done by so-called average users and not by large mining operations,” Smith said. “It would be a real shame to see this dedicated group left without options for supporting the network in their own way, and perhaps even present a dangerous situation for the network to be secured only by large and well-capitalized firms.”As mining does continue to get more expensive, only those companies that have the resources to create large operations will be able to survive. The fewer operations that are mining, the more likely it is that one, single source could take a majority of the hashrate, creating potential security problems.“We will continue to make our machines available to Joe Miner for as long as we are making hardware,” Smith said. “It’s an unfortunate situation that we’re the only big ASIC manufacturer selling directly to consumers right now; we’d love to see more competition in this space and for the miners themselves to have more options available.”Jacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and journalist covering finance and bitcoin. He runs a weekly newsletter all about bitcoin and digital currency called Crypto Brief.",

    "text": "Mobile games are one of the many technologies that have begun to integrate cryptocurrencies. For example, Shaq Fu: The Legend Reborn has integrated Quarkcoin for in-game payments, and new games based on the blockchain, using Huntercoin and Motocoin, have emerged.EverdreamSoft, a Swiss mobile gaming company, is a part of this movement, and has committed to using bitcoin with its star franchise. Using the Counterparty protocol, EverdreamSoft plans to place their online trading cards on the Bitcoin blockchain, along with a new cryptocurrency called BitCrystals.EverdreamSoft rose to popularity in 2010 with the release of their app Moonga, one of the first free-to-play games for iOS or Android. The online trading game has been ranked the top role-playing game in the Japanese App Store, and has been downloaded more than 250,000 times.In order to compete with larger and better-funded competitors such as Blizzard Entertainment, EverdreamSoft continues to innovate in hopes of regaining the spotlight. Based in Geneva, the city of private banking, Bitcoin has long been on the company’s radar.“I believe that blockchain technology will create a profound change on our society,” said CEO Shaban Shaame via Skype chat . “We are at the dawn of complete change in how people exchange value over the Internet.”EverdreamSoft plans to take advantage of smart properties on the blockchain through its integration with Counterparty. Rare digital game cards in Moonga will be placed on the Bitcoin blockchain so that they can be used in other Moonga games and easily transferred between players by sending a transaction .The first new video game to take advantage of this ability will be Spells of Genesis.Moonga was a pure card game, requiring the player to build the perfect deck of Spells with which to battle. Spells of Genesis, however, adds an arcade twist, with additional elements of timing and strategy. The Spell cards are represented as orbs, which you must launch at enemies on the playing field to drain their life before they drain yours.BitCrystals, the cryptocurrency native to Spells of Genesis, will be used to fund the development of these features. One hundred million BitCrystals will be created on the blockchain as Counterparty assets, and 70 million of those will be sold in a presale lasting 30 days.BitCrystals derive their value from their utility and purchasing power in the Spells of Genesis game. Although you can effectively buy or sell cards in any currency, BitCrystals are necessary to purchase booster packs and bring new cards into the economy. The BitCrystals are then burned or recycled.EverdreamSoft claims the crowdsale will begin as soon as they gain enough social media traction, and that development is under way. Currently, only testers have access to the alpha version, but a beta version is scheduled to be released next month.",

    "text": "In a rare move in the Bitcoin space, KeepKey has simultaneously begun to take orders for and to ship their flagship bitcoin hardware wallet. As of Wednesday, customers are able to purchase the USB device for USD$239 on Amazon, or directly from the KeepKey website using bitcoin. Worldwide shipping is included in the cost.The KeepKey hardware wallet is designed to store and secure bitcoin while protecting them from virtual attacks such as malware and viruses. The device generates and stores bitcoin private keys, never sharing them with the connected computer. Another key feature is a large OLED screen that displays every transaction before it can be approved, thus allowing users to verify that they are sending funds to the correct address and reducing the chance of error.“Our guiding principle is to empower individuals and organizations with bank-grade bitcoin security,” says Darin Stanchfield, the founder of the company. “This is what our device does, and it is simple to use. Other products that are available require a high level of sophistication to operate. With KeepKey, it is very difficult to do the wrong thing,”KeepKey currently works with Google Chrome using the KeepKey Wallet Extension . It is also supported by popular bitcoin wallets, including Electrum and MultiBit .“Our security model was designed to ensure that the user always has complete control over their private keys,” said Ken Heutmaker, a software engineer at KeepKey. “We feel that relying on trusted third parties degrades the security and privacy that the bitcoin ecosystem offers.”As for KeepKey’s decision not to take pre-orders in order to fund the hardware wallet’s development, Stanchfield cites his own personal experience with being “burned” by other companies who have pre-sold items and then not been able to deliver.“A customer takes enough risk when they buy any product,” Stanchfield said to Bitcoin Magazine . “We don’t think they should assume the risk of funding manufacturing, too. We made this promise to ourselves early on in development of KeepKey. Fortunately, we have had the finances to pursue this route to get KeepKey to market.”",

    "title": "The Bitnodes project issued its first incentive last week and will continue to do so until the end of 2015",
    "text": "The Bitnodes project issued its first incentive last week and will continue to do so until the end of 2015 or until 10,000 nodes are running.The program uses an incentive program started as an experimental process to reward those who run a node. Rewards for running full nodes are being paid in bitcoin.A Bitcoin node is a part of the network that allows Bitcoin to operate the way it does. It increases security and improves reliability by validating transactions and blocks and then relaying that information to other full nodes.Any individual can run a full node by using the Core client (Bitcoin Core).Miners, the ledger clerks of the Bitcoin sector, are incentivized by rewarding them for solving blocks. These blocks contain information about recent transactions and the reward (at the moment) is 25 bitcoin, which can be spread among those contributing toward the mining.But there are no similar incentives for individuals or businesses running full nodes. They have only the gratification that they are supporting the network. And if they are not mining, others are being rewarded for it. This is a problem, as nodes are arguably as important as mining.Another problem: Keeping a full node running for an extensive period entails cost. The hardware being used may be out of play for anything else, or the cost of electricity is significant after an extended time.The Bitnodes project introduces the Peer Index (PIX) as a way to measure nodes in the network. It is based on 11 properties that can be found in greater detail here. Then nodes are listed on the leader board for all to view.“If your node is not already up on the leader board, make sure that it is reachable by other peers in the network and activate its node status from https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/nodes/,” said Addy Yeow of Bitnodes.There are currently 4,006 active nodes. IP, ISP, client, country and more information is available via Bitnodes.Yeow accedes that the incentives program is not an ideal solution to completely remedy the growth, or lack, of Bitcoin nodes. Further discussion is needed from the community for problem-solving and figuring out a more long-term solution to encourage individuals and businesses to run long-term nodes.Recent updates have extended the 60 day charts to 90 days, a full quarter of a year. This has been done to give a clearer picture of Bitcoin Core version adoption. Also, a STALLED alert has been introduced to notify node operators when their node has not downloaded a newer block from its peers for some time.One of the long-term potentials of Bitnodes is that it could be used to estimate the size of the Bitcoin network that uses newer versions of Bitcoin Core (version 0.8.x or newer). A full list of the Q1 updates for Bitnodes can be found here on Github.The potential for rewarding node administrators exists. Further incentive applications are probably needed, but there is scope for this future development. Involvement from the public is sought since the next gem of an idea can come from anyone.Getting InvolvedIf you want to get involved in the programming or the discussion, do so via Github here. The crawler implementation (in Python) is also available from Github and can be found here.Even if you are not a programmer or you do not think you can contribute to the discussion on development, you can always be part of the solution by running a node (bitcoin core) and leaving it running on an old computer in a spare room.If you plan to run a node, you should have 50 gigabytes of free disk space, 2 gigabytes of RAM and an Internet connection with uploads of at least 400 kilobits (0.4 mb). Check regularly to ensure you do not exceed your upload limit (if relevant), and that you leave your node running for at least 6 hours a day.Bitcoin nodes map via bitnodes.io",

    "text": "Double standards are like mosquitoes to me: after hearing their buzz for a while, I want nothing more than to shine a flashlight their way and swat them down mercilessly. One such double standard is the harsh way in which economists and commentators criticize Bitcoin technology, while at the same time taking for granted the financial system that they live under every day.Yes, the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is very volatile still, and the ecosystem that develops around them has been a Wild West so far. But in the six years of Bitcoin’s existence, the underlying technology—decentralized and open source in nature—has proven itself to be extremely robust and constantly evolving. Bad computer code is replaced over time by good code (or at least by a stable workaround), and likewise, bad companies are forced by the market to make way for better ones. Creative destruction rules the cloud.The same things cannot be said about the fiat currency system. Banks and central banks are still running old cranky software, with systems that sometimes haven’t been updated since the 1960s. Vital parts of the service and technology is centralized and therefore frozen in time, in a spiderweb of ever-expanding bureaucratic rules. And bad banks don’t die; they are kept alive with “Bailout IVs” from the government, and they become zombie banks. In Fiat Land, it’s King Inertia who waves the scepter. Fiat money itself is also increasingly fragile. According to a study of 775 fiat currencies, there is no historical record of any that have held their value:“Twenty percent failed through hyperinflation, 21 were destroyed by war, 12 destroyed by independence, 24 were monetarily reformed, and 23 are still in circulation approaching one of the other outcomes...The average lifespan of a fiat currency is 27 years.”[1]The post gold standard U.S. dollar is no exception. Despite being 44 years of age, which makes it a true veteran of the fiat space, it has lost 97 of its value since inception.[2]And that is just touching the surface of the kind of problems the fiat system produces. As we’ll see in a moment, debt levels, certainly not a sign of economic health, are higher than ever before in history. Inflation is also on the rise in many nations—melting away people’s savings and pushing them into the arms of speculative money managers. And central banks around the world are preparing for bank holidays and bank defaults.When a system is virtually frozen in time and changes only for the worse, it is fair to say that it is broken, and that it needs replacing. That is exactly the state of the financial system today.Now, over to the nitty gritty. Let’s crunch some numbers to see how big the problems really are.The Biggest Debt Crisis in HistoryIn 2008 we saw a ferocious banking crisis, the worst since the crash of 1929. In response, central banks around the world, including those of the U.S., China, and Europe, printed unprecedented amounts of money to shore up the banking system, and governments wrote out bailout subsidies like never before.In Europe, for example, governments committed 1.3 trillion euros[3] to prevent the eurobanks from failing. This led to the 2011 sovereign debt crisis, which was was barely contained by the ECB. It scrambled to put together another 500 billion euro bailout program.What have all these programs, with a combined value of at least $9 trillion, really achieved? Well, since 2008, “leverage” in the system has dropped from 25:1 to 20:1. This means that for every $20 a bank owes to customers or other banks, it has $1 in hard cash in its own possession. To adequately convey the absurdity of these numbers, an average non-financial corporation in the emerging world (not known for prudent risk management) has a leverage ratio of less than 3:1.[4] In other words, without a central bank as a backstop, most multi-national banks would have been long bankrupt.[5]Given the avalanche of bailouts and stimulus programs unleashed since the 2008 crisis, government debt in the developed world has now risen to a record level 111 of GDP.Let’s also not forget the extremely high private debt everywhere, now at 129 of GDP in the world, and at 300 of GDP in the United States.With all this data, it should be no surprise that the BIS estimates the size of the total debt securities market at $100 trillion. That is about $40,000 for every person in the world who has a bank account.[6]The only way for countries to accumulate so much debt is for them to print money indefinitely, and to continuously drop interest rates. And indeed, interest rates are the lowest they have been since the Middle Ages.From the 1700s onwards, leading western nations borrowed at rates between 3-7, whereas recently we saw a drop in interest rates down to below 1 in the U.S. The rates are a little above 1 now, but German 10-year bonds are trading with interest rates as low as 0.5. This trend is unprecedented in world history.Governments, banks, and households borrowing from institutions that can create money out of thin air leads, of course, to inflation.Illustrating this is an inflation world map that I made in May 2013:Here is the updated January 2015 version:Now, one could argue that this just shows the dollar’s strength rather than actual inflation, but consider that the U.S. dollar still is the world’s reserve currency, and the most important way for foreign central banks to defend the value of their currency is to buy back their own currency from whomever offers them U.S. dollars. As was the case with many other collapsing currencies, the hyperinflation of the ruble in 1998 started when the Russian central bank had no more dollars with which to buy back its own currency.That said, the long-term value of the U.S. dollar is highly questionable. Since the U.S. went off the gold standard in 1971, central banks have been increasingly diversifying their reserves, as shown below.Whereas in the 1970s central banks had no problem with holding up to 65 in U.S. dollars, that amount has now declined to 40-45. That certainly doesn’t signal a vote of confidence in the greenback.National central banks are also increasingly moving physical gold back within their own jurisdiction. We’ve seen both Germany and the Netherlands repatriate 120 tons each, as well as Poland, Venezuela, Ecuador, Mexico, Switzerland and others participating in the “gold repatriation movement.” It is no coincidence that this movement started in 2011 at the time of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe; governments are afraid of defaults, devaluations, and/or hyperinflation, and want to prepare for the launch of a new currency.Seeking “Stability”Take a moment to absorb how gargantuan the problems of the financial system have become.Now consider this: central bankers often contradict each other and themselves, but one thing they unilaterally stand for is “stability.” The U.S. Federal Reserve, for example, says its goal is “a more stable monetary and financial system.”[7] Its European counterpart, the ECB, has as its mission statement “to maintain price stability and to safeguard the value of the euro.”[8]Where is this “stability” central bankers keep talking about? How can we believe in a system that achieves exactly the opposite of that which its leaders proclaim?Over the last 10 years, central banks have created new money to the tune of $14 trillion, and that amount is still growing. Just this week, the ECB announced that over the next 18 months it will pump another €1.1 trillion into the eurosystem.Here is what Gideon Gono, Zimbabwean central banker and father of the $100 trillion bill, has to say about the newfangled post-2008 financial paradigm:“I've been condemned by traditional economists who said that printing money is responsible for inflation. Out of the necessity to exist, to ensure my people survive, I had to find myself printing money. I found myself doing extraordinary things that aren't in the textbooks. Then the IMF asked the U.S. to please print money. I began to see the whole world now in a mode of practicing what they have been saying I should not. I decided that God had been on my side and had come to vindicate me.”[9]Gono is right: his example is being followed by every prestigious central bank in the world. And when journalists dare to mention the elephant in the room, they are scoffed at. In fact, this happened just this week, when ECB chairman Mario Draghi was asked whether his policy of money printing would lead to hyperinflation. He dryly responded that despite the massive stimulus programs, “Somehow this runaway inflation hasn't come yet”.[10] In 2008 it became clear that the emperor had no clothes. By now, it should be clear that his entire court is also threadless.ConclusionI will keep my opinion about what all these financial omens forebode for another time, but it should be clear by now that the fiat system is anything but stable.In fact, the stability in our financial system only exists to the extent that people believe in it. It is a mirage much like Bernie Madoff’s “empire” was: as soon as enough people withdraw, it will come tumbling down.A new crisis is brewing in the system, as has happened every 40 years since governments started monopolizing the industry of money and banking. But this time truly is different. For the first time in history, the people have access to a decentralized, open source and globally accessible backup financial system.There may be some problems that arise when Bitcoin technology is scaled up for millions, and then hundreds of millions of users. No doubt there is angst and volatility ahead, and for all we know the Bitcoin network will fail and some other cryptocurrency will take over. But there is no way this ingenious technology is going back into the bottle.We now have access to a protocol that allows for honest global banking with or without intermediaries. For those eager to divest from a financial system of falling cards, I highly recommend drawing from an alternative deck: the exciting world of cryptocurrencies.[1] http://www.resourceinvestor.com/News/2011/1/Pages/IsThisTimeDifferentfortheDollar.aspx[2] Since 1971, the dollar depreciated by 97 against gold, and by 83 against the consumer price index.

    "text": "On Tuesday, February 17, the Canadian Bitcoin community was surprised to learn that its biggest and longest-serving exchange, CAVIRTEX, was to wind down operations by March 25. Enter QuadrigaCX, heir apparent to the title of Canada’s largest Bitcoin exchange.An older version of the CAVIRTEX database, including 2FA secrets and hashed passwords, may have been compromised. Their website states, “We believe that damage to the company’s reputation, caused by the potential compromise, will significantly harm our ability to continue to operate successfully.” Kyle Kemper, VP of CAVIRTEX, also cited a difficult banking relationship as a contributing factor.CAVIRTEX was the second exchange to go down in Canada this year; Vault of Satoshi also declared its intent to close as of February 5th, 2015.“We’ve definitely seen an increase in new accounts over the past few days,” said Gerald Cotten, CEO of QuadrigaCX. He added that the closure of CAVIRTEX came as a “total surprise” to him. Like everyone else following the Bitcoin news in Canada, he knew about some of CAVIRTEX’s difficulties, but didn’t think they were serious enough to close the company. “Security and banking issues…come with the territory when one operates an exchange,” he said.Can QuadrigaCX avoid a similar fate?Cotten places his faith in the company’s security system. QuadrigaCX clients’ passwords are encrypted both server-side and client-side, on-site and in-browser. Even if someone managed to hack in and steal their password hashes, as in the case of CAVIRTEX, those hashes would be useless to the thief.“Total security is incredibly hard to achieve,” Cotten said. “You make one little mistake and a hacker can and will exploit it. Banks can’t guarantee they won’t get robbed; exchanges can’t guarantee they won’t get hacked. That’s why we keep as little [bitcoin] online as possible.” The rest of the funds are kept in cold storage. Cotten added that QuadrigaCX participates in the Bug Bounty program run by Crowdcurity, so their system is continuously being tested for weak points of entry.As for its banking relationships, QuadrigaCX appears positioned to keep legacy banks onside. When it comes to banks, said Cotten, an exchange is “always walking on eggshells.” Before its launch on December 26, 2013, QuadrigaCX registered with FINTRAC as a money services business, becoming the first exchange to do so in Canada. While it isn’t strictly required by law, such registration is perceived by banks as a sign of legitimacy, and registration has minimized the number of banking issues the exchange has had to face. QuadrigaCX was also the first Canadian exchange to integrate INTERACTMOnline.It also helps to have a little luck. Just before it was thrust into the spotlight, QuadrigaCX began a global marketing campaign to expand its business outside of Canada, targeting more international markets. At the moment, it carries CAD/BTC, USD/BTC and Gold/BTC order books, and accepts clients from most countries around the world. Due to regulatory complexities, however, QuadrigaCX does not accept U.S. clients.As for the prospect of other foreign exchanges encroaching on the Canadian Bitcoin space, Cotten isn’t worried. He points out that Bitstamp and Bitfinex are already active in Canada, but he doesn’t foresee too many other companies making a push into the Canadian market. “Trading volume is still very low [here],” he says. “It’s not really worth it for them.” And Canadians who might try to migrate toward foreign exchanges are likely to find the process too complicated and expensive by comparison.To see a recent, in-depth interview with Gerald Cotton, and learn more about QuadrigaCX, visit decentral.tv. For this episode of Decentral Talk Live, Cotten spoke with host Ethan Wilding and guest host Hai Nguyen shortly before the CAVIRTEX announcement.",

    "title": " Avalon, the first company to manufacture ASIC mining chips and sell them to consumers, has returned to the marketplace",
    "text": " Avalon, the first company to manufacture ASIC mining chips and sell them to consumers, has returned to the marketplace with a new chip after an absence of several years. Avalon has announced a new A3218 mining chip that will be released in the Avalon6 miner. According to Avalon, each server can process 3.65 TH/s at a power efficiency of 0.29 W/GH. Each server is composed of 80 of the Avalon A3218 chips. The system requires, at minimum, a 12VC DC, 1,100 watts PSU output. Unlike the other companies that have been developing 14nm chips, Avalon decided to stick with its 28nm ASIC chip. “What I can tell you is that Avalon was offered the 14nm Samsung chip many months ago, and they declined,” explained Sean Walsh, Founder of BlockC, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine . “The 14nm process node is very new, very slow to design/produce, very difficult, very expensive and doesn't currently yield efficiency gains that even come close to compensating for all this. Avalon will produce at smaller process nodes, but only once it actually makes financial sense to do so.”Canaan-Creative, the parent company of Avalon, and BlockC have recently announced a partnership that results in BlockC becoming the global distributor (except in China) of all Avalon products and services in the bitcoin space. According to Walsh, 1 petahash of processing power would cost approximately $350,000 to $360,000.This is quite a bit cheaper than the only other seller on the market, Bitmain, for two reasons,” Walsh said. “First, Bitmain is currently advertising prices of about $380,000 per petahash. Second, Bitmain is not shipping any miners until mid-December, which is a full month later than BlockC.co ship dates. One Petahash currently earns about $90,000 per month in gross profit (after paying electric bills). Running the numbers, BlockC/Avalon is about 7 percent lower on sales price, plus the 25 percent you gain by emerging your PH a month sooner. That’s an effective savings of over 30 percent.”BlockC expects the first batch of Avalon6 miners to arrive in their California datacenters by November 12, 2015. It is currently selling the servers in batches of 10, providing 36.5 TH/s for $14,950.Who is Avalon?Avalon is one of the oldest bitcoin mining hardware companies in the ecosystem. Canaan Creative, the parent company of Avalon, was founded in 2012 by NG Zhang, Jiaxuan Li, who goes by the name Lee, and Xiangfu Liu. The first miner they released was the Icarus, which was a programmable Xylinx FPGA chip released in the beginning of 2012. Soon after, they released the Lancelot, which was also based on the Xylinx FPGA. However, Avalon is best know for releasing the first Bitcoin ASIC miner. In October 2012, NG and Lee began working on Avalon 1, which was a 110nm ASIC chip. Less than a year later, the miner was released, ushering in an era of high-powered, specialty bitcoin miners. They faced some backlash during 2013 due to some production delays, coupled with some probably overly optimistic claims that Yifu [Guo] had made to the public,” Walsh explained. Yifu Guo agreed to do sales and marketing for NG and left in 2013. “However, they resolved the issues, and refunded many tens of thousands of bitcoins to customers. I believe all customers were compensated generously.”Throughout its history, Avalon has released five generations of Bitcoin ASIC chips: 110nm, 55nm, 40nm, and now two 28nm designs. The A3218 is its latest generation. While Avalon has kept a low profile for the past few years, Walsh explained that the company is planning to expand beyond just mining. They recently closed a large series A of venture capital financing, which the company will use for acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. Avalon was (and still is to a large extent) 100 percent devoted to open source software and hardware, as well as the global mainstream adoption of Bitcoin,” Walsh said.With so many other firms taking their bitcoin miners in-house and not selling to the general public, an additional competitor in the public-mining space could bring about continuous development in new, more advanced chips.Jacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business and bitcoin.

    "text": "The rapidly growing Latin American social network Taringa! will start paying its content-providing members in bitcoin, offering a service that could boost Bitcoin adoption in the region, The Wall Street Journalreports.With its 75 million users mostly located in Spanish-speaking Latin America, Taringa! (the exclamation mark is part of the name) is the second-most-popular social network after Facebook and one of the main destinations in the Latin American Web. The social network, whose slogan is “Collective Intelligence,” is a hybrid of Facebook and Reddit, offering a crowdsourced social bookmarking and commenting platform similar to Reddit.“Today we are launching Taringa! Creators, a revolutionary program that allows Taringa! users to receive a monetary compensation for the valuable content they share in our community,” announces Taringa! (in Spanish). “This is a super innovative project, because we will pay in bitcoin: the new virtual currency that works without banks or governments and allows paying via Internet without a credit card or a bank account, instantly and without transaction costs. For that, we signed an agreement with the company Xapo, founded by Argentine entrepreneur Wenceslao Casares, based in Silicon Valley, which offers the virtual Bitcoin wallets where we will transfer the money earned by you, which you will be able to use as you prefer.”Offering a financial compensation to those who dedicate part of their time to power the social networks that are an increasingly important part of everyone’s online life is certainly revolutionary but also overdue, and bitcoin payments are an ideal implementation. Perhaps other social networks such as Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter will follow.“Xapo’s partnership with Taringa! implements the largest bitcoin integration the community has yet to see and is a historic moment for both bitcoin and social media,” notes the Xapo announcement. “Top content creators can now earn bitcoin through Taringa!’s Revenue Sharing Program, rewarding users who bring quality content to Taringa!. The platform is supported by a simple one-click integration with Xapo’s secure bitcoin wallet.”The initiative is likely to will have a huge impact on Taringa!’s user base, largely under-banked despite having access to smartphones and Internet, and could introduce millions of people across the globe to the benefits of Bitcoin. According to Xapo, the partnership has the potential to quadruple the current number of bitcoin transactions worldwide.The traditional payment infrastructure couldn’t support Taringa!’s plans to reward its loyal users for content shared on the social network, and therefore Taringa! had to look for alternatives. Latin America’s “horrendous,” underdeveloped financial system made it impossible to deliver funds, said Taringa!’s co-owner Hernán Botbol. Credit-card networks aren’t developed enough and bank account penetration isn’t deep enough for users to receive payments in their traditional currencies.“We have had this on our mind, mainly because we think we can bring more people to create great content and also because we think that it’s fair, given that all this that we have is just because our users are creating the content,” said Botbol. “But we never were able to do that because the infrastructure is horrendous – even if you send someone a check, they don’t know what to do with that.”The Wall Street Journal notes that the initiative, which exploits bitcoin where the traditional financial system is unable to deliver, could be an impetus for wider adoption in the developing world, where many believe digital currencies have their best chance of success.",

    "title": "Bitcoin payment processor Bitnet has indicated it is willing to implement block-increase proposals other than BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) 101.",
    "text": "Bitcoin payment processor Bitnet has indicated it is willing to implement block-increase proposals other than BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) 101. This makes Bitnet the third signatory of the industry letter supporting BIP 101 that indicates that it is open to alternative proposals. Bitnet co-founder and CTO Stephen McNamara told Bitcoin Magazine that he is still convinced that the block-size limit must be increased sooner rather than later. While the industry letter sent out in August of this year expressed support for BIP 101, which increases the block-size limit to 8 megabytes and doubles every other year for 20 years, it now seems that there is room for discussion. “First and foremost our interest was, and still is, in support of an increase of the block size,” McNamara said. “The community conversations, when they started this spring, were not about different proposals; they were binary – yes/no – about whether a block-size increase was a good thing or not. We are happy to see the discussion shifted from 'if' to 'how.' This is not about a BIP 101 religion, but rather a technical discussion and collaborative constructive review process which can lead to an agreement.” What did not change for McNamara is the sense of urgency as expressed in the letter. While Bitnet does hope that a block-size consensus can be reached within the Bitcoin community, the company believes time is starting to run out. “We can certainly debate how long it may take to fully congest the network, but the fact is we can already see signs of it through unconfirmed transaction spikes, spam and stress tests,” McNamara explained. “This can cause confirmation delays impacting our merchants and higher fees impacting consumers. The issue is urgent. “We have tested BIP 101 internally and are ready for BIP 101 today,” he added. “We do believe in Bitcoin Core and welcome the increased efforts to discuss the issue of block size in the past couple of months. We still hope the block increase can be fully vetted by the core committers and the community.” Discussing some of the proposed alternatives, McNamara indicated that Bitnet has no specific preference for alternative block-size proposals. BIP 100, which lets miners vote on the block-size limit, as well as the “quick fix” 2-4-8 solution that would increase the limit to 8MB over four years’ time, are both acceptable alternatives for Bitnet. “Most miners do now support BIP 100 through mining votes. We are open to BIP 100,” McNamara explained, “and we have no objection to 2-4-8 either. We’re really just trying for a practical solution.” Lastly, McNamara acknowledged he is aware of the risks of oversized blocks, as emphasized by the “decentralist” side of the block-size debate. “We are fully aware of these concerns. To be clear, we do not support a hundred-fold increase of the block size or anything like that – and we never have,” McNamara said. “Any Bitcoin use case that needs this type of volume should consider sidechains or other approaches, at least for the short and medium term. The Bitcoin network needs to grow to be useful, but that growth needs to be well-thought-out.”  Earlier this week, Bitcoin's biggest payment processor, BitPay, indicated that it is willing to implement alternative block-increase proposals, too, while mining specialist KnCMiner shifted its public support from BIP 101 to BIP 100 last summer. With Bitnet, this means that three of the signatories of the industry letter in support of BIP 101 have now publicly indicated they are prepared to accept alternative solutions. ",

    "text": "BitMEX just launched a website to make it easier to keep tabs on hard and soft forks on the Bitcoin blockchain.According to a recent blog post, the research arm of BitMEX is sponsoring a new website, ForkMonitor.info, which is connected to 13 nodes of Bitcoin and its hard forks, most notably Bitcoin Cash. The website will monitor many different aspects of the networks and their associated blockchains, with the ultimate goal of keeping track of these variables during forks to be “potentially useful in helping to detect unintentional consensus bugs.”The article says that BitMEX is launching this new website in anticipation of an upcoming hard fork for Bitcoin Cash, which is expected to take place on November 15, 2018. In fact the head of BitMEX Research, who asked to remain unnamed, told Bitcoin Magazine that, in the short term, the monitor was built to \"provide a useful and simple website to track what happens during the Bitcoin Cash hardfork on 15th Nov 2018.\" For the long term, though, its overarching purpose will be to police the potential bugs and vulnerabilities in Bitcoin's software that updates can introduce.\"The Bitcoin inflation bug discovered in September 2018 was a big concern to us. The bug could have resulted in a long rollback which could have been highly destructive for the industry and BitMEX. The bug was introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.14.0; therefore, those running earlier versions of Bitcoin Core prior to this could have been able to detect the bug. Therefore the idea behind the website is to connect to many old nodes, such that it can be helpful in detecting bugs not present in older versions, but newly introduced. The website is a work in progress and it may introduce more features going forward,\" he continued.BitMEX Research took to Twitter to announce its new tool. In the comment section, the company continued to take shots at Craig Wright, whose infamous claiming of Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity has made him a pariah in the industry, for his part in the November 15 fork.“[Craig Wright’s] (AKA \"Fake Satoshi\") node, Bitcoin SV, is expected to fork off from the network onto a new chain,” the thread reads.The Twitter thread went on to explicitly state that the focus of Fork Monitor will be to examine Bitcoin’s network, insinuating that the website’s highest priority isn’t necessarily looking to keep precise notes on Bitcoin Cash and its own forks. Still, the planned date of the BCH hard fork has given BitMEX ample time to build a functional monitoring website that will eventually gather more hard data. At its current stage, Fork Monitor is something of a pilot project, albeit one that “will hopefully provide useful information to some stakeholders” in the future.This article was update to provide quotes from the head of BitMEX Research.",

    "text": "Blockchain will be airdropping approximately $125 million worth of Stellar lumens to its users, in conjunction with the Stellar Development Foundation. This marks the largest airdrop in cryptocurrency history.Those interested in taking part must possess a Blockchain wallet and be willing to verify their identity. The first group of customers is set to receive their lumens sometime this week at no charge. Stellar is Blockchain’s first airdrop partner since it launched its official “Airdrops Guiding Principles” framework last month.Jed McCaleb, co-founder of the Stellar Development Foundation, believes airdrops can be powerful tools when it comes to building the crypto ecosystem and boosting mainstream adoption.“We believe airdrops are central to creating a more inclusive digital economy,” he said. “Giving away lumens [XLM] for free is an invitation to communities to design the services they need. Our hope is to eventually have global citizens own and use lumens in both developing and developed economies. By working with Blockchain to increase the availability and active use of lumens on the network and leveraging their almost 30 million wallets, we will increase the network’s utility by many orders of magnitude.” CEO of Blockchain Peter Smith explained what attracted his company to Stellar. “We were looking for a protocol and network built for scalability with an active and rapidly growing ecosystem,” he said. “Stellar was a clear frontrunner, and we’re excited to be working with their world-class team.” As part of the airdrop, Blockchain is looking to partner with several additional enterprises including the non-profit fundraising software Network for Good, Stanford’s emerging tech initiative and the online computer science education system Code.org. Blockchain says it will release the details of these partnerships in the coming weeks.Blockchain has aided millions of companies and individuals in both developed and third world nations to get their hands on digital assets. Recently, the company raised over $70 million in a funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Google Ventures. Stellar is a distributed ledger network that permits multiple assets and currencies to be digitally transferred, issued or exchanged online. The system boasts a built-in order book, network token and pathfinding algorithm, allowing assets to move more easily between sending and receiving parties.",

    "text": "The Great Lakes Science Center (GLSC) is now accepting bitcoin in various transactions.According to a recent news story from a Cleveland-based newspaper, the local Great Lakes Science Center has announced their adoption of bitcoin in a variety of transactions.Not only will bitcoin be accepted as a fully valid form of monetary exchange for the daily cost of admission to the museum, but there will also be a four-day sister event, titled the Blockland Solutions Conference, which will accept bitcoin as well. The Blockland Solutions Conference has the larger aim “to grow a blockchain ecosystem in Cleveland,” and the museum saw the event as an opportunity to “also underscore the museum's own innovative efforts as it supports the disciplines of science, technology, engineering and math,” according to GLSC President Kirsten Ellenbogen.This move makes the GLSC the third museum in the U.S. to accept bitcoin, not counting museums that are specifically dedicated to Bitcoin. The Museum of the Coastal Bend in Texas and St. Petersburg Museum of History in Florida make up the other two, but the GLSC is by far the most popular of the three. ",

    "text": "Live updates below the article.Around 16:40 UTC tomorrow, November 15, 2018, the Bitcoin Cash network is set to undergo another hard fork upgrade. But contention about this upgrade has left the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem divided, which could once again lead to a split into multiple projects and coins.Here’s what you need to know about the upcoming Bitcoin Cash fork to get up to speed.As a quick reminder, what is Bitcoin Cash again?Bitcoin Cash (sometimes referred to as “Bcash” or “BCH”) is a cryptocurrency that split off from the main Bitcoin blockchain in August 2017. Culminating from Bitcoin’s years-long scaling dispute, the spinoff project most notably increased its block size limit through a contentious hard fork upgrade, “forking off” to become its own coin — though some of its proponents see it as the “real Bitcoin.” While currently trading at a fraction of bitcoin’s value — around $480 at the time of writing — Bitcoin Cash is the fourth biggest cryptocurrency by market cap and has garnered support from big names in the cryptocurrency space like bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver and Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu.What is this dispute about?The Bitcoin Cash dispute is really between two competing factions, represented by their respective software implementations.In one corner stands Bitcoin ABC, the “original” Bitcoin Cash client that caused the split away from the Bitcoin blockchain a little over a year ago. Led by Amaury Séchet, and with close (though unofficial) ties to major mining hardware producer Bitmain, Bitcoin ABC has a policy of hard forking about once every six months to upgrade the protocol.This time, Bitcoin ABC will introduce several changes. The first and probably main one is called “Canonical Transaction Ordering” (CTOR). While transactions can currently be included in a block in almost any order, under CTOR, transactions must be included in a specific order. The Bitcoin ABC development team believes this offers a couple of technical benefits, in part related to (future) scaling improvements.A second change is a new piece of script (an “OP code”) called OP_CHECKDATASIG (DSV). This extends Bitcoin Cash’s features, most notably by enabling oracles (which allow for a class of smart contracts). Bitcoin ABC also introduced some smaller technical fixes, like a minimum size for transactions.In the other corner stands nChain and its chief scientist Craig Steven Wright, who claims to be the man behind the monicker Satoshi Nakamoto, but has publicly only been able to produce fake evidence. Having released a relatively new software implementation named “Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision” (Bitcoin SV), Wright says he wants to restore Bitcoin to its original protocol: the 0.1.0 version launched in 2009. After that, he’d take a rather conservative approach with few or no further protocol upgrades.To achieve this, Bitcoin SV makes a few changes relative to Bitcoin ABC right now. First, it rejects CTOR, as nChain believes the potential benefits are insufficiently proven and the risks are too high. Second, it increases the default block size limit to 128 megabytes (versus Bitcoin ABC’s 32 megabytes). And third, it reinstalls several old OP codes (with names as OP_MUL, OP_LSHIFT, OP_RSHIFT and OP_INVERT). It also removes the size limit on scripts.Down the road, Wright promises to make more changes to bring Bitcoin SV closer to the 0.1.0 version of the Bitcoin protocol. The block size limit will eventually be increased a lot more or even removed entirely. DSV will be dismantled. (Wright goes so far as to claim DSV would make Bitcoin ABC and its miners illegal. On Bitcoin SV, coins held in “DSV addresses” will likely be turned into donations to miners.) P2SH transactions (which allow for much transaction flexibility and was introduced in 2012) will be deprecated. More old OP codes will be restored. And the nChain chief scientist alluded to bringing “lost” coins back into circulation. (Where “lost” presumably refers to coins that haven’t moved in a long time.)Who supports what?With Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV as the two main competing factions, most of the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem has, by now, picked a side in the dispute.Though in some cases reluctantly, most other Bitcoin Cash implementations have sided with Bitcoin ABC. The biggest of these, Bitcoin Unlimited, has made its latest release compatible with the Bitcoin ABC hard fork by default — though users can configure their software to be compatible with Bitcoin SV instead. Other Bitcoin Cash implementations, such as Bitprim and Bcash, are also compatible with Bitcoin ABC.Most of the biggest Bitcoin Cash service providers have indicated that they will support the Bitcoin ABC hard fork as well. Besides Bitmain’s wallet and block explorer BTC.com, this includes cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Binance and Kraken, payment processor Bitpay and API-provider BitGo. Besides nChain, the companies that expressed support for the Bitcoin SV hard fork are generally smaller. Of those, media outlet CoinGeek is probably the best-known example.CoinGeek owner (and online gambling tycoon) Calvin Ayre is probably also the most well-known individual supporting the Bitcoin SV hard fork — besides Craig Steven Wright, of course. Most “big name” Bitcoin Cash proponents instead appear supportive of the Bitcoin ABC hard fork — or at least dismissive of Wright and Bitcoin SV. This includes bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu, Pirate Party founder Rick Falkvinge, Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer, but also Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and others.At the time of writing, most users seem to favor Bitcoin ABC as well. On futures markets, such as those offered by cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, BCH ABC futures are trading at around $260, while BCH SV futures are trading at around $220. (Though the difference was much bigger only few days ago.) General sentiment on social media like Reddit and Twitter also appears to favor the Bitcoin ABC hard fork — though this is considered irrelevant “proof of social media” by Bitcoin SV proponents. What matters, they say, is proof of work.Which brings us to Bitcoin SV’s main \"weapon\" — perhaps literally. At the time of writing, all the biggest Bitcoin Cash mining pools are supportive of Bitcoin SV. Calvin Ayre’s private CoinGeek pool, Wright and nChain’s public SVPool, nChain’s private BMG Pool as well as Okminer and Mempool all favor Bitcoin SV, representing up to 60 or 70 percent of hash power. The rest of the pools — a minority — are either neutral (for example planning to follow majority hash power) or in favor of Bitcoin ABC.Does this mean the chain will split? And what is all this talk about a “hash war”?It’s complicated.Technically, Bitcoin Cash will indeed experience another coin-split as soon as either Bitcoin ABC or Bitcoin SV mines a block that’s invalid on the opposing chain (for example, because transactions in the block are ordered incompatibly). This also means that all BCH holders get coins on both sides of the split. In principle, all users should be able to mine, send and receive both coins.If this were a “clean split,” the two coins would be separated through a technical trick called “replay protection.” Transactions on one chain are invalid on the other, so (regular) users would be affected as little as possible.But this will not be a clean split. While Bitcoin ABC implemented replay protection, Bitcoin SV copied this “protection” to cancel it out.As such, transactions will look identical on both chains. This means that a Bitcoin ABC transaction can be re-transmitted (“replayed”) on the Bitcoin SV chain, having users accidentally spend both. And the other way around: Bitcoin SV transactions can be replayed on Bitcoin ABC. When Ethereum Classic and Ethereum split without replay protection in 2016, this caused significant losses to unprepared exchanges, like Coinbase. Therefore, this time many exchanges and other service providers will halt withdrawals and/or deposits for some time.But that’s not all. The split could unleash what has by now come to be known as a “hash war.”Craig Steven Wright has explicitly stated that, in an attempt to ensure only “his” chain survives, he and others will use any hash power under their control to 51%-attack the Bitcoin ABC chain. Such attacks, first speculated about during Bitcoin’s scaling dispute in 2017, could, for example, consist of mining only empty blocks on Bitcoin ABC and “orphaning” (rejecting) any blocks mined by “honest” Bitcoin ABC miners. This would have the effect that no transactions will confirm on the Bitcoin ABC chain at all, and that “honest” miners will be strongly discouraged from mining on it: their hash power would go to waste. If Wright and others successfully take this (rather unprecedented) step, there would not be a meaningful chain-split after all: only the Bitcoin SV chain would survive.While all this is very speculative, Bitcoin ABC could defend itself against such an attack in several ways, too. For one, Bitcoin ABC users could simply wait out the attack, as it costs the attackers money every hour, and this cannot last forever. Alternatively, (Bitcoin) miners could opt to draw more hash power from the Bitcoin blockchain to mine on the Bitcoin ABC chain, or deploy more hash power altogether. (Some news sources claim Bitmain is indeed doing this.) Or, in what is typically considered the “nuclear option,” Bitcoin ABC could choose to deploy another hard fork to change the proof-of-work algorithm, rendering the attacking mining hardware incompatible with its blockchain. (Bitcoin ABC lead developer Amaury Séchet has already acknowledged this option is on the table.) There may be other countermeasures too, like less radical protocol changes.Or, perhaps all this talk of a hash war will soon prove to have been nothing but a bluff. Bitcoin Unlimited chief scientist Peter Rizun, for example, doubts that the Bitcoin SV development team will be capable of pulling off a successful attack in the first place.Do I need to do anything? Will I get both coins in case of a split?Once again, it’s complicated. But here’s the important part: If you own BCH, control your private keys and don’t transact during the fork, you’ll own any post-split coins.With that out of the way, there are roughly three scenarios to take into account.Maybe only one coin survives the split. In that case, wallets and other service providers will presumably support this coin, either right away or later on. If you hold your private keys and your wallet supports the coin, you will be able to transact. If your wallet does not, you’ll need to extract your wallet seed or private keys and insert them in a wallet that does. (There’s no rush to do any of this.)Second, two coins could survive the split, both with their own name and ticker. (In this case Bitcoin ABC seems most likely to get the name “Bitcoin Cash” and “BCH,” but this could differ from one service to the next.) This is where you need to be particularly careful, as there’s no replay protection. When you send one coin you may unintentionally send the other along with it — or vice versa. To avoid this, you need to first split your coins by using a splitting tool, for example, or by sending your coins to an exchange or other type of service that will split the coins and send both back independently. (Again, there’s no rush to do any of this. Until you know what you’re doing, it’s best to do nothing at all.)Third, we can’t ignore the possibility that a hash war could escalate to the point that no coin is left standing — at least, not in a meaningful way. Whether it will be due to the 51%-attacks themselves or a loss of confidence or otherwise, cryptocurrencies can fail, and given the circumstances described in this article, Bitcoin Cash is certainly no exception.There are more potential scenarios, some of which would result in even more coins. This includes a coin that ignores both Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV’s upgrades or a “coin” that is compatible with both. But these scenarios seem quite unlikely or temporary at best and are probably not something worth worrying about for the time being.Finally, and obviously, none of this affects users of bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency right now. (Though if hash power does move over from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash, it could slightly slow down transaction confirmation times on the Bitcoin network.)This article will be updated as the events of the fork unfold.Update, November 14th, 22:05 UTC: Roger Ver's mining pool bitcoin.comannounced it will redirect hash power from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash ABC for one day.Update, November 14th, 23:00 UTC: While it may of course be unrelated to the upcoming hard fork, BCH prices tumbled from about $530 to about $440 today. This is more than most other cryptocurrencies, most of which are down significantly.Update, November 15h, 11:40 UTC: Tensions are running high as the Bitcoin Cash hard fork and potential hash war draws closer. According to a screenshot circulating over social media, Bitmain cofounder Jihan Wu haspledged to be \"all in to fight till death\".Update: It looks like the screenshot may have beenfabricated.Update, November 15th, 13:05 UTC: More good news for Bitcoin ABC: major cryptocurrency exchangeBitstamp and internet pioneerJohn McAfee have pledged their support.Update, November 15th, 13:20 UTC: For an overview of different types of attacks that could be deployed during the BCH hash war, see these articles byCoinDesk's Rachel Rose O'Leary andBTC.TOP CEO Jiang Zhuoer.Update, November 15th, 14:35: With a little over two hours to go until the hard fork takes place, BCH SV is trading significantly lower than BCH ABC on Poloniex' futures market: $125 versus $290.Update, November 15th, 15:15: Data, statistics and other information about the upcoming hard fork can also be seen live on webpages includinghashwar.live,forkmonitor.info, statocashi.info andcash.coin.dance.Update, November 15th, 15:50: With less than an hour to go until the hard fork, BCH SV futures dropped even further relative to BCH ABC: $80 versus $275 on Poloniex. Hash power over the past day still favors Bitcoin SV with about 70%, with the remaining 30% divided between Bitcoin ABC and neutral.Update, November 15th, 16:20: With 20 minutes to go until the hard fork, only one Bitcoin Cash block was mined for over an hour. The block was mined by an unknown miner, and (oddly) did not include any transactions.Update, November 15th, 16:30 UTC: A regular Bitcoin Cash block was mined by bitcoin.com. Still no block mined by a Bitcoin SV pool, for almost one and a half hour now.Update, November 15th, 16:40 UTC: The official hard fork time has been reached, but it can take about another hour before different nodes enforce incompatible rules. In the mean time, both Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin ABC pools have mined regular blocks.Update, November 15th, 17:00 UTC: Two regular Bitcoin Cash blocks have been mined by Bitcoin SV supportive pools. Different nodes will start enforcing incompatible rules after another four blocks.Update, November 15th, 17:10 UTC: There are at least three livestreams of the event. One hosted byBitcoin ABC supporters, one hosted byBitcoin SV supporters, and one hosted byBitcoiners.Update, November 15th, 17:53 UTC: Six blocks have been mined since hard fork time activation passed. From now on, different nodes are enforcing incompatible rules, and the chain could \"split\" at any time.Update, November 15th, 17:55 UTC: As we wait for a potential split, many spam transactions are being sent over the Bitcoin Cash network.Update, November 15th, 18:07 UTC: Bitcoin.com found a Bitcoin Cash ABC block, rejected by the Bitcoin Cash SV network. Bitcoin ABC has hard forked, and the chain has split.Update, November 15th, 18:09 UTC:Another Bitcoin Cash ABC block was found. There has been no Bitcoin Cash SV block yet. Bitcoin Cash ABC is now two blocks ahead.Update, November 15th, 18:21 UTC: The first Bitcoin Cash SV block was just found. Both Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Cash SV are building on their own chain, with Bitcoin Cash SV one block behind.Update, November 15th, 18:34 UTC:Both Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Cash SV have found more blocks. No 51%-attack has happened so far.Update, November 15th, 18:35 UTC:Bitmain cofounder and Bitcoin ABC proponent Jihan Wu appears to be claiming victory on Twitter, stating \"there will be no more negative gamma after this block in BCH community!\"Update, November 15th, 19:00 UTC:Both Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Cash SV continue to find blocks, with Bitcoin Cash ABC ahead. There is still no sign of a 51%-attack. Bitcoin ABC supporters on social media are cautiously starting to declare victory.Update, November 15th, 19:25 UTC: One interesting datapoint is that the Bitcoin Cash SV blockchain is shorter than the Bitcoin Cash ABC blockchain, even though Bitcoin SV pools had more hash power going into the hard fork. It's been speculated that part of the \"Bitcoin SV hash power\" could be mining Bitcoin ABC blocks in secret as part of a 51%-attack. (But this is just speculation at this point.)Update, November 15th, 20:42: UTC: Bitcoin Cash SV is now one block ahead of Bitcoin Cash ABC, claiming the longest chain.Update, November 15th, 22:23: UTC: Bitcoin Cash ABC overtook the Bitcoin Cash SV chain again.Update, November 15th, 22:45: UTC: The Bitcoin Cash ABC chain is more than ten blocks ahead of the Bitcoin Cash SV chain at the moment. There is still no sign of 51%-attacks.Update, November 15th, 23:00 UTC: On Poloniex, BCH ABC is trading around $290, while BCH SV is trading around $95. At these rates, BCH ABC would be the fourth biggest coin (similar to BCH right now) by market cap. BCH SV would take the 8th, 9th or 10th spot (it would be close).Update, November 15th, 23:20 UTC: While the Bitcoin Cash SV protocol now allows for 128 megabyte blocks, the biggest block so far was just under 32 megabytes: the same limit as previously set on the Bitcoin Cash chain and currently on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain.Update, November 16th, 01:25 UTC: This live blog will no longer be updated. So far, Bitcoin Cash has split in two. The Bitcoin Cash ABC chain is much longer than the Bitcoin SV chain. BCH ABC is also trading higher on (futures) exchanges. There is no sign of any 51%-attacks. Bitcoin ABC proponents seem to generally feel victorious, though many Bitcoin SV supporters haven't quite conceded defeat as they believe 51%-attacks may still come.",

    "text": "That special time of year is coming up — the time when individuals trade in their unwanted or unusable gift cards for bitcoin. And with the price of bitcoin dropping, peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin marketplace Paxful is making it possible to use these gift cards to “buy the dip.”Ray Youssef, Paxful’s CEO and co-founder, explained that, over the past few years, the busiest week for Paxful is the one right after Black Friday; in fact, as time has gone by, the rate of exchange between gift cards and bitcoin has gotten higher and higher.“We calculated the rate of increase in total gift card volume from one year to the next,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “At that same rate, this year’s volume would be $15.3 million. This rate is approximately 271 percent. Given our current weekly gift card volumes, it seems well within the realm of possibility.” At the time of writing, bitcoin’s price has sunk to just under $4,560. Though panic has ensued in some corners of the crypto arena, Youssef isn’t worried about the price drop and feels it’s not likely to affect business on Paxful, even if the price remains as it is or falls lower. “The price doesn’t matter so long as there are people who use bitcoin to translate money,” he comments. “To those in developing countries and countries with declining currencies, bitcoin has been their alternative currency. It’s also good to note that since January 2018, the price of bitcoin has been declining, but Paxful’s volume is continuously rising. Bitcoin will always be the best financial alternative.”Youssef also says that, while gift cards remain popular items amongst gift givers during the holidays, they are not always the best items for receivers, which is what makes the peer-to-peer system so important.“Many people in developing countries have no use for these gift card credits,” he says. “There are also users who have a website or a business as an affiliate for Amazon that maybe makes 10 percent in referring. People in the developing world don’t have Amazon in their areas, but they earn all these credits. Thus, they sell their credits for BTC and then turn the BTC into whatever currency they want. This is how P2P finance and bitcoin fills the voids. We really want to spread the word on P2P finance.”According to Paxful’s internal data, gift cards have been used to purchase over $880 million worth of bitcoin since Paxful first launched its peer-to-peer marketplace in 2015. This accounts for just shy of 64 percent of the platform’s trades. All other methods — including credit cards, debit cards, Apple Pay and Square Cash — only account for about 36 percent of bitcoin purchases (roughly $499 million worth). In total, about $1.38 billion worth of BTC has been garnered via Paxful. The most popular gift cards used to purchase bitcoin are those issued by iTunes. These gift cards have been swapped for over $482 million worth of BTC for their owners. In second place are Amazon gift cards at $303 million, while eBay ($15.7 million), Target ($15 million) and Steam Wallet ($14 million) gift cards hold third, fourth and fifth place respectively. Other popular gift cards include Walmart ($12 million), Google Play ($5.3 million) and the PlayStation Network ($5 million).",

    "title": "In what may well have been the most watched cryptocurrency event of 2018, Bitcoin Cash two weeks ago “hard forked”",
    "text": "In what may well have been the most watched cryptocurrency event of 2018, Bitcoin Cash two weeks ago “hard forked” (split) into two different coins. The “big block” project that itself forked away from the Bitcoin blockchain in August 2017 fragmented into “Bitcoin Cash ABC” (BCHABC) and “Bitcoin Cash SV” (BCHSV).In this third and final overview: the main takeaways and latest developments of the second week since the Bitcoin Cash split.Hash War OverThe Bitcoin Cash split drew as much attention as it did in part because Bitcoin SV proponents had announced a “hash war.” Where previous “coin splits” were relatively peaceful — both sides of the respective disputes went their own way — nChain chief scientist and Bitcoin SV frontman Craig Steven Wright threatened that miners would 51% attack a potential Bitcoin Cash ABC chain out of existence.But as the coin forked and the world watched, nothing irregular happened. Possibly because Bitcoin Cash ABC proponents brought in additional hash power to secure their chain, and because the Bitcoin ABC development team implemented checkpoints, no 51% attack took place.One day after the split, Wright said Bitcoin Cash SV miners would instead maintain an “endurance attack.” If and when more miners left the Bitcoin Cash ABC network, the 51% attack(s) would commence. For well over a week, both chains did attract more hash power than their respective block rewards warranted, suggesting that miners were losing millions of dollars in a seemingly pointless “hash power race.”However, by the beginning of this week — some 10 days after the split — CoinGeek published a press release announcing support for a permanent split. As the publication is owned by online gambling tycoon and major Bitcoin SV miner Calvin Ayre, this declaration was considered an “official” end to the hash war.Technical director of the Bitcoin SV project Steve Shadders even committed to implementing replay protection (ensuring that users don’t accidentally spend coins on both chains), while Ayre acknowledged he would let go of the name “Bitcoin Cash” and ticker “BCH” and instead adopt “Bitcoin SV” and “BSV.” Hash power on both coins has dropped significantly since (with Bitcoin Cash ABC still ahead).The two coins will now compete with one another and the market, as all cryptocurrencies do.Wright and AyreBoth Wright and Ayre took the stage at the CoinGeek Week Conference in London this week. Here, Wright proposed a plan to transform the internet through Bitcoin SV, while Ayre emphasized in interviews that he believes Bitcoin SV is the “original Bitcoin.”Perhaps more noteworthy, on Friday Satoshi Nakamoto’s old P2P Foundation account curiously became active again. The account followed a person named “Wagner Tamanaha” and posted a mysterious message: “nour” which, according to Google Translate, is Arabic for “light.”A little later, Wright tweeted “Some seek a world of shadows... We seek a universe of light” and added another tweet in Arabic: “Light is chasing the darkness.\" While this, of course, proves nothing, and Wright offered no explanation, it’s hard not to interpret the tweets as an attempt to link Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity to his own. (Wright, of course, famously claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto but publicly has only provided fake evidence.)Also worth noting is that Ayre had announced last week that he would reveal documents to prove market manipulation which would involve several prominent names in the Bitcoin Cash ABC camp: bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu, Bitcoin ABC lead developer Amaury Séchet and Kraken CEO Jesse Powell. At the time of writing this article, no documents have been revealed, however, and since CoinGeek Week is over it seems unlikely any will be.At the tail end of the week, Ayre’s CoinGeek did announce it will be acquired by Squire Mining Ltd.Settling InIt is clear by now that both sides of the Bitcoin Cash split will continue as their own cryptocurrencies with their own communities.Shortly after the split, there was disagreement on the names for the two projects. To some extent there still is, but the projects themselves and most of the industry are now settling on “Bitcoin Cash” and “BCH” for the Bitcoin Cash ABC side of the split, and “Bitcoin SV” and “BSV” for the Bitcoin Cash SV side.So far, Bitcoin Cash ABC has made it through the split more successfully than Bitcoin SV. Most companies that offered Bitcoin Cash services before the split now offer Bitcoin Cash ABC as “Bitcoin Cash.” A notable exception is blogging platform Yours, which moved to Bitcoin Cash SV. Several of the cryptocurrency exchanges that offered BCH trading now offer both under various tickers.BCHABC is also doing better price-wise. In the second week after the split, it mostly traded between $150 and $200. BCHSV was trading lower, between $75 and $100 — though that is a lot higher than during the first week after the split. As such, the price difference between the two coins has shrunk.This week, Bitcoin SV made its “official” debut on coin-ranking sites like CoinMarketCap, entering the charts as a top-10 coin. At the time of writing, BCHSV holds ninth position, but it briefly peaked to seventh. BCHABC, meanwhile, had difficulty maintaining the fourth position that Bitcoin Cash used to occupy; at the time of writing, it has dropped to the fifth spot.Perhaps a noteworthy hiccup, cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex experienced withdrawal issues with BCHABC and BCHSV. It’s unclear what caused the issues, and they were resolved within a day or two.And, as one last interesting detail, MMA fighter Rory MacDonald tweeted to his 235,000 followers that “bitcoin SV is bitcoin.”For more background on the split, see “When the Fork Forks: What You Need to Know as Bitcoin Cash Goes to War.” Also see the first and second overview articles, covering the first day and the first week after the split, respectively.",

    "text": "Gabor Gurbacs is confident that the approval of a bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) is inevitable. And he’s optimistic that the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Strategy will be the first to deliver one to the world.The director of Digital Asset Strategy at VanEck/MVIS, Gurbacs, as of late, has become a leading voice on the space’s ETF pursuit at a time when industry chatter on the topic has never been louder. If you haven’t found him extolling the benefits of a bitcoin ETF on Twitter, you may have come across his interviews on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast and Ran Neu-Ner’s Crypto Trader show for CNBC Africa.“America wants a bitcoin ETF,” he told Ran Neu-Ner, “We’re close. It really depends on the SEC whether or when they’re going to approve it.”To find out more about what an ETF is, what it would look like for bitcoin and who alongside VanEck is vying for one, check out our November cover story.As confident as Gurbacs may appear, some might say the director is too confident in his surefire predictions. Historical precedent isn’t exactly in his favor, after all. The VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Strategy is one of only two proposals, the other being the Bitwise HOLD 10 Cryptocurrency Index Fund, that hasn’t seen a decision. As for the other filings, the SEC has rejected nearly every proposal that has come across its desk, although its last nine rejections, which were made at the staff level, are still pending review by the Commission.Even against these odds, Gurbacs believes VanEck and SolidX is poised to buck the trend, especially since the asset management firm has set its own precedent that Gurbacs thinks will swing odds in VanEck’s favor: a history of bringing institutional products to market.A History of Firsts“VanEck has a history of building international stock and gold investing, in the U.S. and abroad,” Gurbacs said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.VanEck introduced the first gold equity mutual fund back in 1968 (the VanEck International Investors Gold Fund, which is still around), at a time when the global gold market accounted for a little over $200 million and gold was fixed at $35 per ounce. Half a century later — and with the gold standard for currency backing now obsolete in the U.S. — gold is at $1,200/ounce with a $7.4 trillion market cap and is considered “a global safe haven asset,” as Gurbacs put it. He attributes this growth and the store-of-value status gold has enjoyed since the ’60s to the institutionalization that high-grade investment assets like an equity fund or an ETF provide to the market.As his favoritism toward gold might betray, VanEck’s founder, John van Eck, was actually a direct student of Austrian-American economist Ludwig von Mises, “one of the earliest gold bugs in the U.S.” In the 21st century, VanEck’s pursuit of a finite, globally recognized asset is proving to be generational. VanEck’s current CEO, Jan F. van Eck, John van Eck’s son, has been a pioneer of sorts, as well, leading the company to introduce what Gurbacs called “some of the first non-traditional ETFs” to the U.S. market. Under his direction in 2006, for instance, VanEck launched the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF, a “comprehensive portfolio of global gold miners,” according to VanEck’s website.These gold-focused products were the successors both of the work John van Eck built with the world’s first gold equity mutual fund and of the philosophy his open attitude toward fringe assets instilled in his firm’s investment vision. Now, following in his father’s footsteps, Jan F. van Eck has taken to bitcoin with a similar forward-looking interest, just as his father did with gold decades earlier.Jan F. van Eck, among others in the wider investment community, sees bitcoin as “somewhat of a digital gold,” Gurbacs said, so it makes sense that VanEck is going for gold again in its efforts to win the SEC’s approval for the world’s first bitcoin ETF.VanEck’s interest in bitcoin also makes sense when you consider the market parallels between it and its old world predecessor. Much like its cryptographic counterpart, gold’s first investment vehicles were originally scrutinized as highly volatile, speculative assets, suffering from a stigma similar to the one that bitcoin has faced in its brief, nearly 10-year history.“Back then, gold wasn’t sexy. It was like bitcoin a few years ago,” Gurbacs quipped. A Bid to Make Bitcoin AppealingThe Bitcoin community and the crypto market as a whole seems to be clamoring for an ETF. But so far, the SEC has been holding off on giving its approval.Gurbacs finds that the agency’s rejections stem from the same set of problems that applicants time and again have failed to address, namely “pricing, custody, liquidity and manipulation of the underlying asset.”The sourcing data for these past filings comes from markets and exchanges that are too loosely structured for the SEC to take them seriously, as the underlying spot market is still unregulated on a federal level.“Regulators were very keen on the fact that spot platforms like Coinbase, Gemini and the like are technically regulated entities but not really meant to be brokers for commodities,” said Gurbacs. “In some regulators’ eyes, these entities aren’t regulated,” even though platforms like Gemini and Coinbase are regulated on the state level in New York.The cryptocurrency industry’s spot exchanges lack many of the investor protections that traditional markets feature by regulatory default, such as the surveillance-sharing strategies that the SEC has said are key prerequisites for getting an exchange trading product approved.Gurbacs explained that, in the U.S., equities, commodities, futures and the ETF market make it so that “all of the market data is accessible to regulators should they subpoena or flag any suspicious activity.”In an attempt to appease the SEC, applicants began to pivot toward the futures market in an attempt to give the regulator what it had been asking for: a market that is fully regulated under federal law.VanEck actually started this trend, applying for the first bitcoin futures ETF at the tail-end of last year before the CME and Cboe began trading futures (this is why the SEC promptly asked the firm to withdraw its application twice).The nine applications that were rejected at the staff level and then called up for revival by the Commission in September 2018 took a cue from VanEck, pricing their bitcoin futures ETFs from the now-live CME and Cboe futures contracts.But these futures draw their own prices from the underlying spot markets of popular exchanges, something that played into the SEC staff’s initial rejection rationale. “CME Bitcoin futures are based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), which aggregates bitcoin trading activity across major bitcoin spot exchanges,” the CME website states. For its part, the Cboe sources pricing data from the Gemini exchange, which Gurbacs points out only accounts for “a small percent of daily bitcoin trading volume on a good day.”So, not only do these ETFs’ pricing sources lack a regulated market structure, but their transaction volume is too slim to guard against manipulation, the SEC’s thinking goes. And while they’re pending review by the Commission, Gurbacs thinks that, ultimately, there’s nothing novel enough about the filings to convince the SEC to change its mind.“I don’t expect the SEC to walk back on its decision over those 9 ETFs because none of the providers solved any problems related to market structure issues that the SEC clearly outlined. I’m glad they’re reviewing and doing their jobs, but I don’t see any change.”Forging the Way ForwardTo avoid stumbling into the pitfalls of its competitors, VanEck has been careful to follow all of the SEC’s directions. In sum, this involved creating a market structure with more structural integrity than the one pitched to the SEC in other filings.“We’ve met with regulators a few times and made sure we understand their questions, spending years — literally years — to answer those questions and build the proper market structure: what’s the right pricing, should surveillance be in place, how do you trade institutionally, how do hedge against market manipulation,” Gurbacs said.These steps involve guaranteeing institutional-grade insurance for the fund, setting up proprietary custody arrangements with an undisclosed bank and settling the ETF’s shares in cash, rather than in-kind with bitcoin because, as Gurbacs put it, “unfortunately, the U.S. prime brokerage system and custody system is not set up to handle physical redemption in bitcoin right now.”Proving its worth to the SEC also means that VanEck has to show that its pricing sources differ from competing applicants. To clear this hurdle, VanEck has built its own pricing source from the ground up, based on feedback from the SEC.According to Gurbacs, the source draws from three established over-the-counter (OTC) pricing feeds from regulated broker dealers or affiliates of regulated broker dealers, though he couldn’t disclose further information as its currently not public. However, it is similar to an index that one of VanEck’s subsidiaries, MVIS, created in league with CryptoCompare. MVIS also features indices for many mainstream investment products, and Gurbacs believes that its bitcoin pricing feed subjects the fund to the same “rigorous practices, regulatory-driven disclosures and client protection rules” that the SEC wants to see in a bitcoin ETF.The ETF EffectThe biggest underappreciated scaling platform for Bitcoin is the financial system.Given VanEck’s commitment to fully addressing the SEC’s feedback, Gurbacs is hopeful that the VanEck and SolidX’s filing will be the first to win over the regulatory agency, and he attributes this optimism toVanEck’s “over a half of a century of history with U.S. regulators” in working to bring products to market.Toward the end of our conversation, Gurbacs reiterated the company’s history of crafting first-of-their-kind products, returning to VanEck’s work with sponsoring the first gold equity fund in a nod to the commodities’ similarities to bitcoin. He hit on the meteoric growth gold enjoyed as a result of its institutionalization, and he stressed that bitcoin could experience a similar trend.But when asked to clarify if he thinks that a bitcoin ETF would catapult the asset to new heights, Gurbacs hesitated. Instead, he insisted that it’s not about the price effect an ETF would have, but rather, what it will mean for legitimizing bitcoin and freeing up avenues for adoption.“That’s tough for me. I’ll be up front: I do not like price prediction. I don’t think that’s the important part. Providing access to the assets in a regulated and globally accepted way is the important aspect of our efforts. I’m hoping that the impact is that people who previously couldn’t get involved with buying bitcoin will also get into the market; it’ll also help adoption.“Bitcoin does not need an ETF, but it would benefit from having an ETF. An ETF would help bitcoin survive for at least 100 years. And I’m not kidding with this. There was gold trading before a gold fund or a gold ETF, but when the first product came out, the gold market grew tremendously, practically from $200 million to $7.4 trillion, and toward the end of the spectrum (5-10 years), volatility dampened and gold established itself as a global store of value — a government hedge, a hedge against global markets. Bitcoin is just like gold. It needs financialization in order to get more liquidity and achieve the status of a true store of value. Financialization is good for bitcoin. It helps liquidity, it helps adoption, it helps with scaling. The biggest underappreciated scaling platform for Bitcoin is the financial system.”Bitcoin maximalists and the crypto community faithful might take issue with Gurbacs’ final statement. Some have made the argument that an ETF is fundamentally incompatible with bitcoin’s ethos. They have argued that instead of helping Bitcoin, an ETF would actually be a stain on the industry.It seems that this is one area where bitcoiners and the SEC can find common ground, seeing as they’re both likely to argue that bitcoin should not be subsumed by the traditional financial sector. But Gurbacs, who holds that the “ETF is, in some ways the most trust-minimized of all trading vehicles,” believes that there’s common ground still that both sides are ignoring.“We built our ETF so that it stays closer the core values of Bitcoin: holding physical bitcoin, providing verifiable, issued supply so there are no reserves that are unaccounted for.”He added: “Bitcoin maximalists don’t talk about the middle ground where Bitcoin does fit into the U.S. capital market — and on the regulatory side, arguments also always go that it can’t fit in it.”Rounding out our talk, Gurbacs echoed Hester Peirce’s own interview with Bitcoin Magazine, insisting that the demand for an ETF is too high to ignore. He also thinks that the SEC would be doing more harm than good by restricting free-market access to a sounder investment vehicle than is currently available on the market.“The SEC’s job is to keep a fair and orderly market and protect investors. Regulators shouldn't say that ‘bitcoin is not a good asset and therefore we’re not going to let an ETF happen.’ They should evaluate whether the disclosures are right or not and let the market decide whether the asset has merit. I think regulators have made merit based decisions before, and regulators might have implied bitcoin has no merit. Given that this is a new asset class, they’re a little afraid.“Right now the regulatory environment not approving an ETF fosters this grey-area activity. Lightly regulated trading platforms, which often operate without investors having any regulatory recourse, force investors into a grey area, versus giving them something like an ETF, a fund structure that has decades of history and fits into a proper regulatory regime and has customer protections. My biggest frustration is: how is it possible that a well-constructed, insured, liquid ETF is not ok — but it’s ok for random technology companies, with often no license, to sell bitcoin in the U.S.? It’s kind of weird. So, by not making a decision and not letting an ETF set a higher standard, this gray area of activity is fostered and the whole U.S. principle of free market competition is also violated, and the SEC’s principles of protecting investors and ensuring fair and orderly markets is violated.”With VanEck’s current filing slated for a decision by December 29, 2018 — or February 28, 2019 at the latest, if there is a delay — Gurbacs might get his wish. Even if he doesn’t, the director insinuated that the firm will continue to wrestle for an institution-grade product, however long that may take.“We’ll continue to engage and fight this fight to do our part as an asset manager to help the digital asset space mature. So it may not be a short fight — I don’t know. But we have done this with gold in the ’60s, and hopefully now, we’re building the right basis that will stay true to bitcoin as well as integrate it into the U.S. capital markets.”",

    "text": "Cryptocurrency mining firm Bitfury Group has closed a Series C, $80 million funding round led by EU-based Korelya Capital. The round also included crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital, Lian and Jabre Group, Dentsu Inc., Armat Group and others.Bitfury is a diversified blockchain company known for its expertise in developing high-performance computing technologies, processing capabilities and advanced blockchain-based solutions for companies and governments, including the development of a blockchain-based land registry in Ukraine. The funding round will be used by the company to enrich its software and hardware development, as well as explore other technologies that are emerging alongside the blockchain.“This private placement enables Bitfury to expand our existing areas of focus, including securing the Bitcoin Blockchain, as well as hardware and software development – and broaden our financial strategic options. It also enables us to concentrate on adjacents such as high-performance computing, including emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI),” CCO John Mercurio told Bitcoin Magazine.Valery Vavilov, CEO and co-founder of Bitfury, said the success of the round was a reflection of the company's achievements and its ability to meet the needs of “adjacent market segments in high-performance computing.”In correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine, Vavilov stated:“We are very pleased with our successful private placement, which enables us to expand our work designing ground-breaking blockchain solutions to governments, businesses, and institutions around the world. Strong support from the investor community also allows us to concentrate on adjacent businesses such as high-performance computing, including emerging technologies like artificial intelligence.Bitfury made headlines last week when word broke out that the company may be considering going public. When Bitcoin Magazine asked if this private funding changes the prospect of an IPO, Mercurio responded with the following:“Bitfury is continuously evaluating financing options to support its development strategy, and the IPO is one alternative. But no decision has been made and ultimately it will depend on a number of factors, including the capital markets environment.”At a time when cryptocurrency miners are being criticized for the energy consumption required to secure public blockchains with high security requirements, Bitfury has made a commitment to using renewable energy. It has also created standard processes for reducing the consumption of energy in its data centers by using immersion cooling technology. In September 2018, Bitfury announced a bitcoin mining chip called the \"Clarke\" ASIC chip, which it claims offers the “strongest performance among bitcoin mining chips and is unparalleled in efficiency,\" via a Medium post. The company also has plans to integrate Clarke into its range of existing mining products and on its mining farms across the world.In addition to the Clarke chips, the company also launched its latest computing servers dubbed the Bitfury Tardis. Both the chip and the server will be included in the company's product offering, the Bitfury BlockBox, per reports on its release.Founded in 2011 and recognized as the largest, non-Chinese company that provides hardware for bitcoin mining, Bitfury is also known for pioneering the hybrid algorithm Flare on the Lightning Network, which ensures that payment routes can be found as quickly as possible.",

    "text": "\n There have been many attempts to create a working decentralized marketplace using cryptocurrency for transactions. Projects like Bitbay, Syscoin, the NXT marketplace, and Openbazaar have gained attention over the past few years building this vision. However, another concept announced back in the spring of 2015 called Drop Zone remains in the background. The proof-of-concept may offer yet another method of operating a censorship resistant marketplaces in the future. \nAlso read: The Digital Revolution Increases Sovereignty\nDrop Zone Gives a New Idea Towards the Decentralized Marketplace Concept\nThere are a few concepts within the bitcoin community which seem to be coveted killer applications. This very much includes ideas like the decentralized exchange and marketplace. After the takedown of the Silk Road back in October 2013, the decentralized marketplace concept became more of a focus. A few notable projects have taken on the task of bringing this idea to fruition.\nOne concept that has been introduced called Drop Zone is a project that hasn’t seen much adoption but could still prove useful in the future. Back in March 2015, an anonymous person operating under the pseudonym Miracle Max introduced a new idea to the Cryptography mailing list. Drop Zone is a decentralized marketplace platform written on top of the bitcoin protocol. The project remains unfinished for the time being, but a released version of the code written in Ruby is available via Github and Rubygem. Miracle Max details that Drop Zone offers a functioning command line for “the selling, buying, and facilitation of secure messaging between buyers and sellers using nothing but the Blockchain and testnet.”\nHow Drop Zone Works\nDrop Zone claims to be a solution to censorship. When a seller wants to sell a good, a brief description is uploaded to the blockchain. Buyers searching for goods search items located close to their location. Drop Zone’s creator says, “goods are announced next to an expiration, a hashtag, and if space permits, a description. Once a buyer finds a good in a defined relative proximity, a secure communication channel is opened between the parties on the Bitcoin test network (‘testnet’).”\nCommunication between the two parties on the testnet allows negotiations to be finalized, and the seller pays the buyer via the bitcoin mainnet. When payment is complete, GPS coordinates are revealed, and the buyer can proceed to pick up the good at the pre-agreed upon location. The concept removes the third party risks associated with contraband sales, or any sale for that matter, and the entire operation is piggybacked on top of the bitcoin network. But Drop Zone also has several vulnerabilities that need to be addressed as well.\nDrop Zone’s weaknesses are pretty significant with issues like reputation selling and Sybil attacks. This means reputations could possibly be manipulated or spoofed within the marketplace framework. Another issue, unresolved sales and dispute resolution, could prove pretty difficult. Furthermore, the white paper explains Drop Zone is vulnerable to non-fungible transactions, URL identifiers being centralized, and asymmetric risks to buyers.\nDecentralized Markets Are Being Curated and Soon May Be the Way the World Trades\nThe concept, very much in its earliest phase, has yet to be fully released to the public. It is a unique localized idea with regards to decentralized markets. There isn’t much of a user interface, but the code could be tested if two parties wished to experiment with this protocol. Back in August, Miracle Max said he hopes people look into developing this environment stating:\n\nAs adoption increases, Drop Zone will provide instantaneous, convenient hyper-local market services.\n\nI spoke with software developer and Bitcoin Uncensored host Chris DeRose who spoke with Miracle Max before he disappeared from the Drop Zone project. Max has gone quiet explains DeRose who plans to start hacking away at the code which may possibly bring him out of the woodwork again.\n“After TNABC I should have most of my distractions removed, and I intend to travel to Asia where I’ll be working through a Drop Zone GUI that’s both usable, and hosted as a static resource hosted on Github pages,” DeRose details. “Drop Zone has a lot of promise, not only in terms of solving problems, but also demonstrating the efficiency of blockchain: censorship resistant storage. I’d like to see the notion of what a blockchain application is changing from ‘decentralized penny stocks,’ to open software that uses bitcoin at a data layer for solving real-world problems.”\nThe decentralized marketplace idea will come to life in the future, and it’s safe to assume many types of different trade arrangements will be made. Projects like Openbazaar have been gaining popularity and progressing. There are also many Silk Road offshoots within the darknet realm, but most all of these markets are centralized. Drop Zone may prove to be yet another way people can obtain censorship free trade and sell whatever they want. Bitcoin’s technology once again could help push forward the attempt to free the markets worldwide.\nWhat do you think about the Drop Zone concept? Let us know in the comments below.

    "text": "\n An organization called the American Black Cross is a recognized 501 (c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to helping U.S. political prisoners. The charitable group was inspired by the Ross Ulbricht case, whom many believe is a political prisoner incarcerated for victimless crimes. As the new year approaches, bitcoiners can donate to this cause that helps a growing population of imprisoned people.\nAlso Read: Free Keene Launches Bitcoin Radio Commercials\nBitcoin Donations Can Help Fight The War on Drugs, Victimless Crimes, and Overall Internet Freedom \nRoss Ulbricht was convicted to two life sentences for hosting the Silk Road an online marketplace that sold illegal narcotics.\nThe war on drugs has devastated the lives of many people and their families. Since the beginning of the “Say No to Drugs” campaign in 1980, the U.S. prison population has multiplied by five times. Statistics detail that nearly 86% of the federal prison population in the U.S. are incarcerated for victimless crimes. A victimless crime can incorporate a drug offense, public disorder, or any illegal action that does not directly violate other citizens.\nIn October 2013, Ross Ulbricht was arrested for the victimless crime of operating the Silk Road marketplace, which sold contraband mostly consisting of narcotics. Many people within the cryptocurrency and libertarian communities believe that Ulbricht’s trial was unfair and his prison sentence that followed very extreme. Ulbricht received a double life sentence without the chance of parole for hosting a website that sold drugs. Because the family believes they witnessed a legal atrocity they have been relentlessly fighting for their son’s freedom and the millions incarcerated for victimless crimes.\n“As we close out 2016, we want to remind you that among the ways you can help Ross is by making a tax-deductible donation to the American Black Cross,” explains the Ulbricht family. “The creation of this 501 (c)(3) organization was inspired by Ross’ case. It is dedicated to defending American political prisoners, sadly a class of people that is rapidly growing.”\nThe American Black Cross Assists Political Prisoners \nThe American Black Cross’ mission is to help people incarcerated for opposing the U.S. government. The organization accepts both credit card and bitcoin donations that are directed towards legal aid, and defense funding towards criminal cases where civil rights have been infringed. Political prisoners or family members can submit a request for assistance from the Black Cross.\n“If you are under indictment or represent an individual imprisoned in the course of resisting the federal government, and you believe your case may have a substantial impact beyond the interests of its litigants, please submit a request for assistance,” details the American Black Cross. “Submissions are considered by our Review Committee on a regular basis, and if we believe we can offer you assistance or funding, we will make contact with you.”\nThe 501 (c)(3) nonprofit charity founded in 2015 consists of a network of volunteers and activists focused on “defending the prisoners of American Imperium, their humanitarian relief, and to the abolition of the country’s industrial prisons systems.”\nBlack Cross explains they act as a civil liberties defense organization focused on defending those who have opposed the government via the internet. The nonprofit’s current project is committing funds and resources towards the legal efforts of Ross Ulbricht. Black Cross calls Ulbricht’s conviction bitterly unjust and aims to help the ongoing appeal.\nPolitical Cases Like These Shape Precedence \nA lot of people within the cryptocurrency community support the Ulbricht family and the Free Ross organization. This is because many believe the Silk Road was an inspirational stab at the nation state’s totalitarian policies. Furthermore, the investigation, Ulbricht’s arrest, the server takedown, and the double life sentence are questions begging for answers. The server takedown alone begs the question of how far federal investigators can go without warrants regarding criminal investigations involving the internet. A lot of people hope the drug war will someday come to an end, but unless we as a people fight for our sovereign rights, the rules of sociopaths will continue to reign.\nWhat do you think about the American Black Cross organization?

    "text": "\n Bitcoin is making waves globally as it broke through the psychologically important $1,000 barrier on several large exchanges today Sunday, 1 January. It had already broken all-time highs in several currencies as global bitcoin exchanges reported record-setting monthly volume. Bitcoin’s price has increased more than 120% since the start of 2016 alone. \nAlso Read: Why Bitcoin’s Triumphant $15B Market is Just Getting Started\nBitcoin’s exchange rate versus the US dollar crossed the $1,000 mark first on the online exchange Bitfinex on Sunday evening GMT. Shortly, that line was crossed also at Bitstamp, after the exchange rate had reached 1005 USD per bitcoin at Bitfinex and 1000+USD per bitcoin at Kraken and Coinbase among other sites.\nBitcoin’s new highs also meant a new market capitalization record above 16 billion USD and an 87.8% dominance compared to all other coins, on Coinmarketcap. The last time Bitcoin hit $1,000/USD was in November 2013, amid wholly different circumstances.\nBitcoin did surpass the $1,000/USD mark in Chinese yuan terms as Chinese volume hit record highs already back in December, but did not cross that mark on large “western” exchanges like Bitfinex, Bitstamp and Kraken until Sunday. Analysts theorize that Chinese capital has moved into bitcoin to get around capital controls and a devaluing yuan. \n\nBitcoin also broke all-time record highs in euros around the Christmas holidays, as well as the all-time high in Brazilian reals, according to data provided by Mercado Bitcoin.\nOnline forums and chat services like Twitter and Reddit were ablaze with celebratory comments and exclamations marks around the new highs.\nAmid the December excitement, Barry Silbert, founder/CEO of Digital Currency Group, tweeted that “it’s happening,” assumedly referring to global adoption. \n\nBest part of having invested in 19 bitcoin exchanges around the world is we get to see their monthly volumes… \nFolks, it is happening\n— Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) December 28, 2016 In the Middle East, Bitoasis tweeted that December had already broken the exchange’s monthly volume records. “December has been our best month yet since launch,” tweeted Ola Doudin from BitOasis, a Bitcoin exchange based in Dubai. “We broke new daily volume records…”\nIn Mexico, Mexico bitcoin exchange Bitso reported new records as Bitcoin soared passed 20,000 pesos. “Another monthly record for @Bitso! More transaction volume this December than 2014 & 2015 combined,” tweeted Pablo Gonzalez, Bitso CEO. \nA More Mature Market\nBitcoin has only gained more legitimacy since its 2013 record price run. Not only are massive financial institutions and multinational corporations researching and developing systems in part inspired by Bitcoin’s blockchain, but Wall Street hedge funds trade Bitcoin itself today, as well. \nThe 2013 rally took place amid thin trading volumes. For example, just 7 million bitcoins changed hands among traders in December 2013. 113 million coins have traded hands so far in December 2016. \nAlthough well-known figures in the cryptocurrency space have suggested the mainstream media is oblivious to bitcoin’s price gains, others note that much discussion about the recent price rise focuses just on how high the price will go.\n“The media continues to speculate what the reasons for the rise might be, but enthusiasts already know,” a senior market analyst at trading platform eToro, Mati Greenspan, told Business Insider on Wednesday. “They’re simply speculating about how high it will go.” \nOn CNBC’s Closing Bell December 28, analysts discussed if Bitcoin was the new gold; i.e. a new ‘safe haven’ asset, a type of instrument generally seen as protecting one’s portfolio from economic uncertainty. \n\nNow that Bitcoin has crossed the $1,000 threshold, conversation around the cryptocurrency as a new safe haven is sure to continue.\nWhy is the Bitcoin price increasing in your opinion?

This drove the price of bitcoin above $30 and took bitcoin market cap to a new high of $1 billion.\nAll the good news fueled a price spike which occurred on April 10, 2013, amid the backdrop of the Cyprus haircut protests. The price continued to climb, surpassing $100 for the first time. However, the new high of $266 on MtGox soon crashed to under $60 before slowly returning to the $120+ range.\n\nNovember 2013 Bubble\nAfter many months of Mark Karpeles running a pair of trading bots called Willy and Marcus who faked volume at MtGox, speculation grew rampant. Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed to the all-time high of $1,242 on November 28, 2013. However, users soon discovered that could not withdraw their money while the price on MtGox dwindled down to $0 throughout February 2014.\n\nHowever, unlike the previous bubbles, there were three other major USD exchanges this time around. Prices at Bitstamp, Bitfinex and BTC-e, where people could make withdrawals, took a big hit but never fell to their previous lows. At Bitstamp, the peak was lower than MtGox, at $1,163, which did not fall below $400.\n\nWhen is the Next Bubble?\nAmong many speculations was one by Mike Casey Sr. BI Developer at General Motors who recently wrote a blog post analyzing bitcoin bubbles. While speculative in nature, he provided compelling and detailed arguments, comparing bitcoin price charts to the Gartner Hype Cycle, the S-curve, and Fractal mathematics.\nHe claims that bitcoin bubbles largely follow the hype cycle “because the nature of bitcoin investment is almost entirely speculative. Speculation is driven, in large measure, by hype.”\n\nLike a fractal, the chart between the April 2013 spike and the November 2013 spike mirrors the chart between the November 2013 spike to the present, on a smaller scale. Casey hypothesized that the upcoming spike will take a similar form.\nHe also noted that we are currently in a phase where the price gradually makes its way back up to the old high price. “Once the price reaches a sustained level of 80–90% the old peak, the bubble cycle typically starts over again with another bull run,” he wrote. After much analysis, he said “I anticipate we have one more plateau,” which is “likely around $900.” Finally, he speculated that:\n\nAt present, all technical indications are that we are several months away from a new hype cycle and bull run.”\n\nWhen do you think the next bubble will be?

    "text": "\n Federal agencies of the US government are expanding their calls for quantum computing resistant encryption methods. In effect, the National Institute of Standards (NIST) recently announced a request for public-key post-quantum algorithms. This action follows warnings from the National Security Agency (NSA) about the risks of potential quantum-based cyberattacks and the NSA’s appeal for developing post-quantum algorithms.\nAlso read: New Developments in Quantum Computing Impact Bitcoin\nMoreover, in the near future, it might possible for anyone to manipulate the awesome power of quantum computing. The astronomical price of a quantum computer would not be a limitation because, for example, IBM is offering to the general public quantum computing via the cloud.\nNIST Calls for Post-Quantum Cryptography\nQuantum computing’s extraordinary processing power will dramatically change the world by opening up fantastic opportunities for the creation of previously unimaginable solutions, enabling a new world era.\nOn the other hand, if quantum computing falls into the wrong hands, its immense power might be used maliciously. “If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will compromise the security of many commonly used cryptographic algorithms,” says NIST.\nConsidering that the latest scientific discoveries and technical development suggest that quantum computing is becoming a reality sooner than we thought, NIST has decided to take precautionary measures now.\nAs a first step, NIST has started developing standards for post-quantum cryptography. To this end, NIST is asking the public, through the Post-Quantum Crypto Project, for algorithms that could be able to resist a quantum-based malicious attack. Details of the requirements are in the “Submission Requirements and Evaluation Criteria for the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process.” The deadline for submitting proposals is November 30, 2017.\nThis urge for acting now to be ready to withstand quantum-based attacks follows the NSA warnings about quantum computing risks: “A sufficiently large quantum computer, if built, would be capable of undermining all widely-deployed public key algorithms used for key establishment and digital signatures.”\nIn this regard, in January 2016, NSA informed national security systems operators and developers of the switch from Suite B Cryptography to the Commercial National Security Algorithm, asking them to plan and budget accordingly.\nNSA specifically recommends in its CNSS Advisory Memorandum to replace SHA-256 with the SHA-384 algorithm. Notice, Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm.\nCloud Quantum Computing Becoming Available to the Public\nThe cost of quantum computers is very high. For example, NASA and Google paid $15 million for the current model, the 1,000-qubit computer, in 2013.\nNow, D-Wave plans to start shipping the much faster 2,000-qubit quantum computer model in 2017, which will certainly come with higher price tag.\nTherefore, buying a personal quantum computer is not yet in the realm of possibility. However, you might not need to buy a quantum computer at all. IBM is already offering access to their quantum computing platform via the cloud.\nAccording to its website, IBM is “offering students, researchers, and general science enthusiasts hands-on access to IBM’s experimental cloud-enabled quantum computing platform, and allowing users to run algorithms and experiments, work with quantum bits (qubits), and explore tutorials and simulations around what might be possible with quantum computing.”\nNIST and NSA are starting to develop cryptosystems that would be invulnerable to quantum-enabled malicious attacks. In parallel, the price of a quantum computer might not be a deterrent for hackers for much longer. Indeed, quantum computing might become accessible to the general public via the cloud, at an affordable cost.\nAlthough many believe Bitcoin’s secure hash algorithm, SHA-256, is sturdy enough to withstand quantum-based attacks, bitcoin protocol developers should nevertheless start taking precautionary measures to ensure that Bitcoin’s technology remains immune to any threat.\nDo you think the Bitcoin SHA-256 algorithm is quantum-resistant? Let us know in the comments below.

    "text": "\n The peso has steadily declined in the past three years and today sits at twenty-to-one to the dollar amid a period of economic uncertainty. In a nation of 120 million, 80 million lack access to basic financial services; that is, no banking and no credit. \nMexico does, however, have 100 million cell lines. 80 percent of the phones sold in 2015 were smart phones. In short, Mexico is a highly connected country. Mexico is also a very “young” country (the median age is 28 years old).\nFor perspective on this growing bitcoin market, the Bitcoin News team spoke with Bitso President and co-founder, Daniel Vogel.\nMexicans are Discovering Bitcoin\nBitcoin.com (BC): Why is volume exploding at Bitso?\n\nDaniel Vogel (DV): Mexicans lack access to financial services. They’ve started to discover bitcoin and use it in their daily life. The use-cases are varied. People make payments in e-commerce, for instance. These are Mexicans without credit cards, bank accounts, and who have been excluded from e-commerce until bitcoin.\nWe see males between 16 and 21 making $20 purchases of bitcoin once every six weeks. After doing research, we found these were young adults without credit cards, who were fans of gaming platforms they couldn’t buy before bitcoin.\nOne of the largest manufacturers started accepting bitcoins, and we experienced a rush of young guys who literally didn’t even know what bitcoin was. It was their only way to make payments for these platforms. \n\nI am not sure some even understand bitcoin, but they do understand the concept of how to convert pesos into bitcoins, and send bitcoins to merchants. \n\nThe Five Segments of Bitso’ Customers\nBC: Can you tell us more about Bitso’s customers?\nDV: We break down our clients into different segments. We have roughly five different segments. All of them growing. \nThere are people investing in bitcoin for savings. These people understand diversification. It’s very difficult for them to save as a Mexican. You can’t have a US denominated bank account. Investing small amounts of money in Mexico’s stock exchange is nearly impossible.\nThe second segment use it as a way to access payments like e-commerce. Maybe they saw Microsoft accepted bitcoin. You get people who understand after their bank has denied them of a credit card many times. \nThe third segment trade bitcoin and cryptocurrency for speculation. We these think this use-case is least interesting, as you can trade any commodity in the world. But we need these people. They bring liquidity. They improve prices. We’ve seen an increase in this activity. \nThe fourth segment is remittances. We have a number of people who have started to rely on bitcoin as a way to send money to Mexico. When you send money into Mexico with bitcoin, you practically get paid for doing so because the demand, and premium, is so high. This small but growing use-case includes one interesting example in Chicago, in one of the most Mexican neighborhoods or streets there, called eighteenth street. You can find a bitcoin ATM there. People send bitcoin to Mexico with this machine. \nThe fifth segment will likely see a big increase in 2017; that is, people building products on top of our exchange, and who rely on bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Sometimes they don’t even advertise to their customers they use bitcoin for cross-border transactions, business-to-business. \nThe Peso\nBC: How has the peso’s plight factored in? \nDV: Mexico’s currency has significantly devalued against the dollar in the past six months and over the course of several years. For those living in Mexico, there is no access to investments protected from Mexico’s volatile financial system. \nThere is a lot of uncertainty in the Mexican markets with the recent election of Trump. Questions arise for the Mexico economy: ‘What does this mean for NAFTA, remittances, trade, and commerce?’ That uncertainty has made the peso the weakest it’s looked since the nineties.\nSome understand they can hedge Mexico economic risk with bitcoin. We’ve seen increased demand there. If you look at the price on our platform, it’s higher than the equivalent price in the US due to buying pressure within Mexico.\nPoverty & Bitcoin Adoption\nBC: What role does poverty in Mexico play in bitcoin adoption?\nDV: I think it’s helping adoption. There’s no way to save in anything that does not have systemic risk with the mexican economy, and bitcoin provides that. The day of Trump’s election, the peso plummeted. The Mexican stock market plummeted. \nWe are seeing more interest from diverse players, from highly sophisticated family offices that want to invest in this technology, this currency, as an asset to not as wealthy or sophisticated individuals who get the basic concept of seeing the Peso devalue. Mexican students, too, who are studying in the US at a four-year college or two year master degrees, but their savings are consistently devalued. We allow people to purchase starting at two dollars worth of bitcoins and less, which people take advantage of.\nThe Legality of Bitcoin\nBC: What is the outlook for bitcoin’s legality in Mexico?\nDV: Over last year we have been meeting with regulatory authorities in Mexico – the central bank, the Ministry of Finance and the Banking and Securities Commission. We have been very open with what we are doing, and educating them. We get a mixed reaction. \n\nSome believe this could be an answer to Mexico’s financial inclusion problems.\n\nWe’re working on regulation with the authorities, and we still don’t know what to expect. We have meetings lined up with regulatory bodies in January. We are optimistic we will receive regulatory clarity. We still operate in a gray area, which is how most exchanges have operated. \nThe recent growth in transaction volume in Mexico, I think its indication to authorities we need to look into this very seriously, and very quickly.\nWhat do you think about the prospects of bitcoin in Mexico?

    "text": "\n When most people think of bitcoin, they look at the price and its billion dollar market capitalization. However, bitcoin’s ecosystem is bigger than most people can imagine with its constellation of significantly growing micro-economies.\nSince bitcoin’s inception over the years, the cryptocurrency has created a massive economy of people who work directly with this protocol every day. This includes miners, software developers, startups, artists and writers, and many more groups and individuals who help build this infrastructure every day.\nAlso read: Meet Tumblebit: The Unlinkable Payment Hub\nFour Smaller Economies Tethered to the Bitcoin Ecosystem\nMiners  \nBitcoin has created a growing industry within its mining sector. This includes individuals and organizations who are mining the currency daily and securing the network at the same time. Moreover, there have been companies created that manufacture mining devices, ASIC chips, and more, creating a very competitive industry. Mining has grown exponentially over the years as technology has progressed. New improvements in ASIC hardware and the creation of mining pools have built a robust economy within the bitcoin community. Due to its technical aspects mining is still a niche market, but is expected to grow significantly in the future.\nSoftware Developers\nEven beyond the bitcoin space, the need for software developers is in high demand. Yet as the cryptocurrency grows more popular, the network is creating lots of jobs for programmers dedicated to blockchain and digital currency technology. Many companies and promising startups are looking for software developers to help build code that is focused on the bitcoin protocol. While searching job sites like Monster and Indeed, the most prominent jobs needed in this space are blockchain programmers who understand bitcoin. The economy of developers bitcoin has created will likely increase vastly over time as this type of work will constantly be needed.\nDigital Currency and Blockchain-Based Startups\nAs bitcoin has grown, many new companies have appeared aimed at harnessing this technology. Over the past few years alone there have been a plethora of startups building businesses with all kinds of unique ideas. Companies focused on bitcoin-based remittances, payment processors, bill payment solutions, atm manufacturers, hardware production, and many more types of businesses. Many of these startups are creating businesses modern society has never really experienced before until bitcoin came along. Exchanges, marketplaces, distributed autonomous organizations, prediction markets, and more that are truly peer-to-peer and decentralized. Cryptocurrency and blockchain focused startups are sure to continue with quite a few of them failing and some becoming very successful.\nArt, Network Marketing and Writing  \nBitcoin’s economy has also given life to graphic artists, marketers, and writers. The industry surrounding the bitcoin environment needs people to create written descriptions, advertisements, and graphic visuals to help spread adoption. Since bitcoin was created, it has seen an abundance of occupations in these fields. Graphic artists have created visuals that help portray this technology in a different manner. Meanwhile, freelance writers have found employment from cryptocurrency news outlets and blogs. These types of marketing jobs are a part of a commercial trade that is mainly focused on the bitcoin protocol, community, and the technology’s branched solutions.\nA Multitude of Occupations and an Emphasis on Security  \nOther occupations that fill the bitcoin economy include consultants, accountants, human resources, risk managers and more. Moreover, people often turn to advisors for help to grasp these emerging technologies. This brings the need for consultants teaching people about the industry, software, and the risks and benefits of these protocols. \nAnother significant market growing within the bitcoin environment is the security sector. Cyber security and creating new methods to secure digital assets will always be needed. Improvements in technology and malicious hacks like ransomware continue to prime the online security sector. This bolsters more individuals and groups working on improving multi-factor authentication, biometrics, threshhold signatures and many more concepts of heightened security. The bitcoin protocol has created a robust system of transferring wealth without a third party but security solutions will constantly need improvement.\n Bitcoin’s Evolutionary Constellation Will Change Things Faster Than We Think\nThere are important micro-economies tethered to the bitcoin environment. As bitcoin continues to gain mainstream adoption and reaches critical mass, these smaller economies will swell indefinitely. Additionally, the bitcoin constellation of economies should continue to branch out with more participatory opportunities for individuals and groups.\nWatching bitcoin grow in its earliest phases is very reminiscent to the birth of the internet era. As time gradually continues, bitcoin’s changes to society may become more subtle but watching these micro-economies multiply has shown things are changing fast.\nWhat do you think about the micro-economies that surround the bitcoin environment?

    "text": "\n Today is the eighth anniversary of the bitcoin genesis block, and a lot has happened since the digital currency’s birth. The genesis block was the starting point for the bitcoin blockchain on its path to becoming a revolutionary network for peer-to-peer transfers of value.\nAlso read: Meet Tumblebit: The Unlinkable Payment Hub\nThe Genesis Block \nOn January 3rd, 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto unleashed the genesis block into the wild. The genesis block contains the first 50 BTC block reward and cannot be spent by anyone. The bitcoin software was released on Sourceforge the web-based service for open source developers. The original Satoshi client was compiled using Microsoft’s visual studio and is written in the programming language C++. Satoshi began building the code in 2007 and was the only developer that made software changes to the bitcoin protocol up until mid-2010. \nThe first block also includes text from the UK Times newspaper saying “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,” a reference to bitcoin’s birth-date and possibly mocking fractional reserve banking. With Satoshi’s creation, the total number of bitcoins in circulation will never exceed 21 million BTC.\nRaw hex version of the genesis block with bank bailout message. 1/3/09\nThe genesis block has received 1,073 transactions since its inception, with random people adding over 16 BTC to this unspendable address. No one knows why the genesis block was created to be unspendable, as there is no explanation in the Satoshi source code version 0.1. Additionally, the genesis block was hard-coded, and nearly all altcoins derived from bitcoin have this initial unspendable block reward.\nSatoshi explained that if the bitcoin’s design was to remain static, certain rules like capped supply, the hard-coded genesis block, mining difficulty and reward halvings mustn’t be changed. To this day the design of the bitcoin protocol is important because it’s the base foundation of the entire network.\n\nThe nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.\n\nBitcoin Has Created New Millionaires \nJarred Kenna is one of bitcoin’s millionaires and an early investor.\nWithin the bitcoin network, there is the well-known rich list of addresses holding vast amounts of bitcoin. The list hasn’t changed much over the years, and some of the wallets are believed to be owned by Satoshi. The biggest holder in bitcoin has 124,956 BTC and commands 0.7778% of the coins in circulation. Only three addresses contain over 100 thousand BTC, and the rest contain 79 thousand or less.\nSome transactions, sent to wallets believed to be owned by bitcoin’s founder, contain messages asking Mr. Nakamoto for donations. However, without tracking transactions down to when Satoshi mined his bitcoin, it is hard to calculate which addresses are owned by the anonymous creator. \nOther interesting holders over the years include the U.S. Marshals wallet, which contained bitcoins seized from the Silk Road. Other notable wallets include Lazlo’s pizza exchange or the largest transaction ever that transferred over 500 thousand BTC back in 2011.\nAnother interesting fact is since bitcoin has once again crossed the $1,000 per BTC range there are definitely new sets of cryptocurrency millionaires. For instance, Tim Draper managed to gain nearly $13 million by purchasing bitcoins from the U.S. Marshals. Other notable bitcoin millionaires include Charlie Shrem, Yifu Guo, Jered Kenna, Peter Vessenes, Bruce Wagner, and more.\nIt’s safe to assume there are probably a bunch of new people entering into this realm of wealth as bitcoin have been dispersed over the years.\n10 Interesting Bitcoin Facts \nThe past eight years has seen bitcoin mature into a billion dollar economy operating without central banks, corporations, or government entities. There are many interesting facts about the network and it’s surrounding community and industry. Here’s a list of ten facts you may not know about when it comes to the history of bitcoin. \n\nSatoshi Nakamoto may have mined over 1 million coins during his years within the bitcoin community.\nAn estimated 64% of bitcoins have remained untouched in wallets since bitcoin’s inception. \nIt’s estimated that 5% of bitcoins in existence had passed through the Silk Road marketplace\nDuring the holiday season of 2013, a New York resident sold his home for $800,000 in bitcoin\nSatoshi Nakamoto sent the first transaction to developer Hal Finney on January 12, 2009\nFor the first 12 months of existence, users could obtain roughly 1,300 hundred BTC for $1 USD\nDenial-of-Service (DOS) attacks can affect the bitcoin network, but there are built-in protections\nBitcoin is not anonymous. Every transaction can be followed to its original origin. It can be pseudo-anonymous as long as a user takes the necessary steps of obfuscation. \nThe number of computer lines of code within the bitcoin protocol is 31,000\nBitcoin has reached parity with the U.S. dollar, one troy ounce of silver, and one troy ounce of gold over the years. The end of 2016 shows the cryptocurrency is once again coming close to parity with one troy ounce of gold.\n\nThe eighth anniversary of the genesis block is a significant landmark on bitcoin’s timeline, but the cryptocurrency is still a nascent technology. It will be interesting to see how the next eight years turns out for the decentralized digital asset. \nWhatever the case may be Bitcoin has been a watershed moment in history and remains one of the most innovative technologies since the creation of the internet.\nWhat do you think about the eight year anniversary of bitcoin?

Some simply track the bitcoin price in terms of US dollars, while others prefer to watch the number of on-blockchain transactions per day increase over time.\nAccording to coin.dance, the weekly Localbitcoins global trading volume increased from just under $10 million to around $18.5 million over the course of 2016 (excluding the holidays).\nAlso read: Russian Authorities Ban Localbitcoins, Contradicting Previous Statements\nWhy Localbitcoins Volume Matters\nTo be clear, it’s always difficult to figure out why people are using bitcoin because the very nature of the digital money does not directly attach real-world identities to the transactions on the network. Having said that, there are some interesting aspects of the Localbitcoins experience that make the weekly volume chart worth watching.\nLocalbitcoins is basically a place where buyers and sellers of bitcoin can meet to make trades locally or over the Internet. Users are not forced to share their personal information, which means bitcoins can be bought and sold more privately, and the fact that a long, drawn-out signup process is not involved means bitcoins can be purchased without waiting a few days for approval from an exchange.\nDue to the relative privacy and and convenience offered by Localbitcoins, prices there tend to be higher than what’s found on Bitfinex or any of the other major bitcoin exchanges. Bitcoin buyers are essentially willing to pay a premium to get fast, relatively-private access to bitcoins.\nPeople who want to use Bitcoin quickly and privately tend to be the people who aren’t having their needs met by the traditional financial system. For example, someone who needs to make a ransomware payment may not be willing to wait a few days before being able to purchase some bitcoin via their bank account because they’ll lose access to their files forever if the payment is not made by a certain time. Additionally, users of darknet markets, such as AlphaBay, can appreciate the added privacy of meeting up with someone in person to exchange cash for bitcoin.\nIn some situations, Localbitcoins may also be the only option for buying bitcoin, which is usually a sign that the local region’s current financial system is not very accommodating for a variety of other use cases.\nWhich Countries Saw Growth in 2016?\nThe growth in global Localbitcoins volume seen in 2016 came from both developed and developing countries. Steady growth was seen in western nations, such as Australia and the United States, and the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). The country that saw the largest growth in Localbitcoins trading volume in 2016 was Venezuela.\nIn the case of western, developed nations, it is assumed that the Localbitcoins volume accounts for those who are trying to avoid KYC and AML regulations when obtaining their bitcoins. That sort of activity also likely takes place in the BRICS countries, but the state of traditional financial systems in these countries may also play a major role.\nvia coin.dance\nLocalbitcoins is the highest volume exchange for trading between bitcoins and Russian rubles. This particular trading pair saw its weekly volume triple over the course of 2016.\nSouth Africa was the only BRICS country that saw a decline in Localbitcoins trading volume over the course of 2016, although the volume there is still about as much as India and Brazil combined.\nVenezuela saw the largest growth out of any country in 2016, with an increase from 26 to 276 bitcoins traded per week on Localbitcoins. This increase is much more notable when factoring in bitcoin’s US dollar-denominated price rise over the course of the year.\nNot the Whole Picture\nOf course, Localbitcoins doesn’t tell the whole story when it comes to non-KYC bitcoin trading volume. There are many other alternatives to Localbitcoins, which include everything from the Local Trader feature in the Mycelium bitcoin wallet to something as simple as Facebook groups. Many buyers of bitcoin on Localbitcoins also often move off of the site after completing a few successful trades with their counterparties.\nAn argument can be made that these sorts of P2P trades are the “real” bitcoin economy, as those who use something like Coinbase do so mostly as a way to speculate on the bitcoin price. If the entry and exit points into Bitcoin continue to see increased regulation and oversight, it could help further develop the bitcoin economy because people will be more likely to stay in bitcoin rather than moving in and out of the digital cash.\nWhat do you think about the role of Localbitcoins in the bitcoin economy?

    "text": "\n The price of bitcoin finally crossed the $1,000 USD range reaching a three-year all time high. At press time the current price per BTC is $1,130, and the past 24 hours of trading has been volatile. Since the 4-digit price break the digital asset has dipped slightly below $1,000 twice so far, but technical indicators suggest bitcoin’s ascending channel shows a continued upward push.\nAlso read: The Bitcoin Constellation Is Bigger Than Most Realize\nBitcoin’s Price Once Again Breaks the $1,000 Mark\nThe fiat value of bitcoin climbed to a position it hasn’t seen in three years on the first day of the new year. The price has steadily hovered in the $1010-1030 range over the course of the past 24-hours. Then on January 4 the price shot forward to above $1100 per BTC. Candlestick charts show the bullish uptrend may continue after pushing through certain resistance levels. Currently, bitcoin’s volume of over $294 million is very high, and the digital assets’ crypto-currency dominance level, which measures a digital currency’s performance in relation to other coins, is approaching 90 percent. However, the psychological aspect of reaching the 4-digit range is making the ride along the way quite bumpy. \nOne week charts show a bullish formation, as well, with the price edging towards the $1120-1150 marks. If the price corrects, there’s a strong floor in the $1000 range and its doesn’t look as though bears could pull it down lower than that. As usual, during these shaky times, it’s a great opportunity for day traders and intra-range strategies. Buying levels could fade a touch as Stochastic variables suggest the value may be overbought. Nonetheless the 100 and 200 Simple Moving Average (SMA) suggest the uptrend may see $1200 in the near future.\n\nBitcoin In The News\nMainstream media was awfully quiet when the price broke 4-digits, but that may have been due to light work schedules over the New Year holiday. There have been headlines from the BBC, the Guardian, and a couple of others but not as many stories as there were in 2013. Nonetheless, the Netherlands mainstream newspaper de Volkskrant covered the subject in great detail. U.S. media has been covering bitcoin’s price performance but definitely way less than before. Of course, cryptocurrency and blockchain-centric news outlets have been all over the story. Even though it’s not as chaotic during this particular bitcoin bull run, media over the past two weeks has been pleasantly positive, to say the least.\nSome of the biggest stories of the year that affected bitcoin’s high demand were headlines about economic turbulence throughout the globe. Brexit set off one of the first big prices pushes of the year alongside capital controls, hyperinflation, and devalued currencies. Tales from India, China, and Latin American were abundant this year, and many speculate a vast portion of these citizens have turned to bitcoin. Another factor that has set in was this summer’s reward halving and the mining of the 16 millionth bitcoin. The fact that the digital currency is becoming more scarce has increased its worth in the long run.\n\nSo What’s the Verdict?\nBitcoin’s current resistance is in the $1140-1150 range at press time with a global spot price average of $1125. Of course, the $1200 mark and higher is attainable, but there will be some stops along the way if upward momentum keeps up. Another psychological moment will be when the price outperforms the value of one troy ounce of .999 gold. Bitcoin’s high price can be scary to some as many are expecting a bubble burst or deeper correction. A bearish trend could happen if something triggers a shake up, like an unfortunate event for example. \nBear Scenario: Bitcoin is holding steady above $1100 USD per BTC at the moment. As abovementioned, this number is extremely psychological, and there could be a downturn. Floors suggest a correction no lower than $1000, looking at current depth and order books. A few bear traps should be expected in the near future.\nBull Scenario: Technical indicators show that the pressure upwards will continue for the time being. Strategically the price looks to be headed north at ranges in between $1150-1200. Fibonacci trend lines suggest the bull run is headed towards parity with the gold ounce shortly. Economic events from China like yuan devaluation, confidence in the U.S. federal reserve, and failing Latin American economies will likely keep the ascending momentum going.\nDisclaimer: Bitcoin price articles are intended for informational purposes only and should not to be considered as trading advice.

    "text": "\n Once again the bitcoin community has been dizzy due to the significant price increase, the following correction, and rumors of China. After the sharp price rally, the discussion has turned to the Chinese central bank warning about the volatile cryptocurrency bitcoin.\nAlso read: China to Play a ‘Leading Role’ in Bitcoin’s Future\nRumors From China Once Again Stir the Crowd \nHere’s what we know. The price of everyone’s favorite digital asset had dramatically risen in value at the beginning of the year reaching roughly $1,145 USD per bitcoin. The day after this substantial gain, bitcoin took a significant dive shaving over $300 off the price. The sudden drop was unexpected to some as the cryptocurrency’s crossover to the 4-digit range didn’t last long. Speculators wondered where the bearish decline was stemming from blaming miners selling off at the end of the year, to those who held for over three years to gain back what they once lost.\nHowever, the uncertainty once again turned to China as many started to speculate the price drop derived from that region. The bitcoin community and mainstream media heard reports of China’s central bank warning about bitcoin. According to the regional publication 8BTC.com, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) explained Chinese exchanges should conduct a self examination of their operations.\n“The recent Bitcoin Price is highly volatile,” explains the PBOC. “To prevent risks and uphold financial stability, PBOC Shanghai and Financial Office of Beijing have jointly met the major heads of OKcoin and Huobi to know the current status of Bitcoin trading. We have reminded them of possible risks and require it operate strictly in accordance with laws and regulations of China. We have urged the two exchanges to conduct self-examination based on related laws and correct, if any, possible irregularities.”\nBTCC Exchange Says Bitcoin is Not Banned in China\nAfter roughly six hours of media reporting that China was banning bitcoin again, statements came out from the Chinese exchange BTCC. The exchange explains that bitcoin is not at all banned in the country and the warning was business as usual. BTCC founder Bobby Lee details: \n\nBTCC regularly meets with the People’s Bank of China and we work closely with them to ensure that we are operating in accordance with the laws and regulations of China.\n\nFurthermore, Lee explains that the bank was warning about the volatility of the cryptocurrency just as it had in 2013. Back in 2013, there were swathes of headlines stating the PBOC was going to ban bitcoin when in fact the bank was merely warning the country’s investors. Lee says that “bitcoin is a virtual good and doesn’t have legal tender status,” and all users should be aware of the risks of volatile trading.\n\nOk, in all seriousness, I spoke to a relative in China and he says it's not any meaningful news. Just PBOC FUD. So China has not banned BTC! https://t.co/mzHgq3ZxrD\n— Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) January 6, 2017 Price Dizziness and Cheap Bitcoin\nAs soon as the bitcoin community started hearing these stories, some believed it but most shrugged it off. Many of them laughing over the internet and posting their favorite China bans bitcoin memes. Others have been speculating that these rumors stem from people wanting to shake up the markets for cheap bitcoins. \nBitcoin is not banned in China and bitcoin is significantly cheaper than it was a few days ago. This is what we know, and everything else has been a mixture of price dizziness, fear, uncertainty, and doubt.\nWhat do you think about the recent events with China and bitcoin’s price movements over the past few days?

    "text": "\n Like a pack of predators in the night, bitcoin is creeping up into mainstream use from multiple different angles. From the poorest in developing countries to the top banks alike, the digital currency is being used in every stratum of humanity. Bitcoin.com explores some of the biggest use cases that could propel bitcoin to mainstream usage.\nAlso read: 2016: The Year Bitcoin Adoption Goes Mainstream?  \nHiding Wealth and Tax Havens\nChinese volumes make up over 90 percent of all bitcoin trading. Whenever the yuan is devalued, and the government announces capital controls, bitcoin’s price usually gets a boost. The digital currency is gaining popularity as a way for the Chinese to get money out of their country.\nEstimates place offshore tax havens holdings as large as $32 Trillion dollars. Hiding wealth from governments is one of bitcoin’s biggest use cases to date. This should grow as more people learn to trust bitcoin as a store of wealth, especially when Swiss bank accounts have recently lost their anonymity and the Panama Papers leak revealed that offshore banking is not safe either.\nInsurance Against Crumbling Economies\nHyperinflation, demonetization, haircuts, bailouts, and other drastic monetary policies are happening at a faster pace globally. Each time it happens, hundreds or even thousands of the smartest people in that country wake up to bitcoin as they watch the value of their personal savings dwindle.\nWhile each event has so far only added a modest few to the ranks of the bitcoin faithful, bitcoin is becoming better recognized as a hedge against local currency problems after each event.\nRemittances Through Mainstream Channels\nA large number of startups now offer remittance solutions using bitcoin, undercutting the speed and costs of traditional remittances by a wide margin. In some places, the solution has worked so well that it’s taken over 20 percent of a local remittance corridor. In Korea, one mainstream bank is already using one of these bitcoin-backed services for cross-border remittances.\nTorrents and VPNs\nBittorrent is free, you say? Sure, but good VPNs are not. Internet Service Providers (ISP) have to work with their local governments and the MPAA to catch pirates downloading videos, which accounts for roughly three-fourths of streaming activity on the entire web. To get around this roadblock, users buy VPN service to hide from their local ISP and continue to watch free movies and tv shows with little worry. In order to hide the purchase of VPN services, downloaders have turned to Bitcoin. Most VPN services now accept the digital currency as a form of payment, and even encourage it for the sake of privacy.\nRansomware\nUnfortunately bitcoin’s excellent features have made it very attractive to the ransomware industry. It’s estimated that over 93 percent of all phishing emails contains links to download ransomware now, with social media also becoming a major attack vector.\nNow a Billion dollar industry, the use case of ransomware is hurting bitcoin’s reputation while simultaneously forcing businesses and others with important data to stock up on bitcoins in preparation for a hack. A recent report from Citrix and Censuswide showed that 33 percent of large businesses in the UK already have their bitcoins stocked and ready to go.\nGambling and Adult Industries\nIt’s no secret that the adult industry is popular on the internet. Both the adult industry and online gambling have laws prohibiting their use in various countries around the world, giving businesses in these niches a very difficult time getting and keeping payment providers. Bitcoin has already started to flourish among a large number of popular sites in both industries.\nEndemic Functionality\nMicropayments, machine payments, multisignature payments, machine escrow, provably-fair betting, and many other types of functionality that bitcoin allows for the first time is giving the cryptocurrency many new uses among entrepreneurs and startups.\nCountless ideas like Internet of Things incentivization, small-scale affiliate payouts, streaming video payments, internet tipping, and monetized Bittorrent downloads were not possible before bitcoin came along.\nNow, startups are popping up daily with new business models based upon them. Given time, it’s not just a matter of one of them going mainstream; it’s a matter of mainstream users getting a taste for new abilities that can’t be had without Bitcoin.\nThe Dark Web\nThe oldest use case for bitcoin has not disappeared. In June 2011, bitcoin found its first successful industry, selling questionably-legal goods on dark websites like the Silk Road. The drug-filled e-commerce site flourished and caused a dramatic price spike that propelled bitcoin into the news as the new way to get illegal drugs online.\nAfter the Silk Road was shut down, many others have emerged to take its place. This ensures that bitcoin, especially once additional privacy-enhancing features like CoinJoin and TumbleBit are added, will remain the best way to anonymously buy anything online.\nMaking a Better World\nBitcoin is a possible solution to many of the world’s problems. Satoshi Nakamoto himself was trying to solve a major problem with the existing financial system when he created it. Several ideological reasons exist incentivizing people to hold bitcoin, such as wanting to fix problems with the existing monetary system, or not wanting to fund immoral wars with their taxes. Many more people wanting the benefit of a global trust machine in their everyday life will also become bitcoin holders sooner or later. The amount that each person holds may not be very much, but the sheer number of people who want to change the world for the better is boundless.\nWhich of these trends do you think is most helping bitcoin reach the mainstream?

    "text": "\n Futurists imagine a day where robots might own ‘themselves’, and even trade property with other robots. Some believe bitcoin could even become the ‘currency of AI.’\nAlso Read: Google’s DeepMind Healthcare AI Will Use Blockchain \nRobotic Bitcoiners\nWhat if robots are self-sovereign entities and they can own property, own money, have legal rights and so forth?\n“There’s actually a lot of precedence for that,” says Jeff Garzik, bitcoin developer and CEO of Bloq, enterprise blockchain developer with emphasis on networks like bitcoin. “It’s been assumed as inevitable that robots will exist and they will own property.” \nMr. Garzik believes robots could one day be considered legal persons, and even trade bitcoins. The bitcoin developer cites how corporations enjoy legal personhood.\n“It’s a legal fiction that they are an entity separate from an individual person,” he told Bitcoin.com. “Entity-hood means corporations can own property, and that they are liable. They are sued instead of individuals running the company.” \nLike a corporation, robots will soon be able to hold value. “We see with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies situations where the technology allows one person to control one-fifth of an asset,” the Bloq founder explained, referring to a multi-signature transaction protocol where three out of five private key holders must sign off for a transaction to be executed. “What if the asset-holders were robot shareholders in a corporation or property? [That’s] pure code, pure robotic script. And Bitcoin helps with that. Cryptocurrency startups are building autonomous agents right now.”\nA robot and its smartphone.\n“Robot scripts can hire people, they can invest in things with cryptocurrency, and hedge funds even use robot-advisors with some sense of individuality already,” elucidates Mr. Garzik, who believes self and identity are the minimum for having an ‘electronic person,’ the policy term for a robot with legal recognition.\n‘Robots’ do trade amongst themselves already on Wall Street. The U.S. brokerage and banking company Charles Schwab has intelligent robot advisors, which the firm markets. On Wall Street, financial analysts are being replaced by robots that read – and react – to Twitter feeds. \nBots also read Reuters, AP, CNBC Financial Times, Bloomberg to forecast how world events might impact the market it trades – from particular assets, equities, commodities, etc.\n“Both stock trades and real world events like Brexit happen so fast,” the former bitcoin core developer reasons, “that humans cannot react to this huge volume of information quickly and in an unemotional, logical manner. Crypto currencies and machine learning are thus converging rapidly.”\nA Near-Future Scenario\n\nMr. Garzik, who specifically believes bitcoin could be the currency of narrow or artificial intelligence, suggests the European Union might recognize the inevitability of robot personhood. A draft motion of the European Parliament last summer suggested robot workers be classified as ‘electronic persons.’ Their owners would have to pay social security for them based on the amount of labor costs the employer saved by using a robot rather than a human, according to the draft European Parliament motion dated May 31, 2016. \nRobots could claim copyright on intellectual property and trade money, if the EU adopted the draft. Alongside private property and other legal rights for robots, society will need to determine how one can sue a robot who is liable for damage.\n“Bitcoin is such a natural thing to pair with AI,” says Richard Craib, founder of Numerai, a data-based San Francisco hedge fund. “Maybe not super important to consumers, but when you want to have software interacting anonymously and people submitting predictions to hedge funds, it makes a lot sense.”\nIn a future where a property can own itself, Mr. Garzik wonders, “What happens when your toaster notices your refrigerator has a fault and shorts the stock of the refrigerator manufacture in bitcoin?”\nWould you welcome ‘Robot-Bitcoiners’ in our midst?

    "text": "\n Last week, Bitcoin.com reported on Supload, a new image-hosting service that pays users in bitcoin for views on their uploaded images. While the service has been well received by bitcoiners, some users have raised concerns that the public at large is not sharing their enthusiasm, stereotyping it as “just another affiliate referral website.” Bitcoin.com investigates how bitcoin businesses can overcome this public perception.\nAlso read: New Image Hosting Service Pays Thousands of Uploaders in Bitcoin \nPublic Perception of Affiliate Sites\nUser ‘Vigilante_Gamer’ wrote on Reddit that “Most of the time when I’ve shared images from Supload, it was received just fine.” However, one instance his post drew negative reaction causing him to delete the post and stop using the service “unless the public perception changes.” He explained that “People in the thread considered it a ‘shady’ website simply because they checked out the site and saw that it said ‘earn bitcoin!’”\nThe negative reaction he received was not bitcoin-specific, but rather a perception that Supload is “just another affiliate referral website,” which is why it appeared shady. A user told him that “People typically spam their referral links all over the place hoping to get them popular so they can make money.” Others on this thread agreed that affiliate sites appear to say “click this so I can make money” rather than “I want to share something with you.”\nThe Revenue-Sharing Model\nArguably, Supload is not an affiliate website since it hosts images and shares advertising revenues with its users. Vigilante_Gamer compared its revenue-sharing model to Youtube, which hosts videos and pays users a portion of their revenue as well. However, the analogy failed to resonate with some users. The response he received was:\n\nIt’s perception. I see someone posting something from an affiliate website when there are plenty of website out there that do the SAME thing just as well if not better? I view it as a cash grab. Most people view it that way.\n\nWhile Youtube is not without its own spamming or worse problems, it’s perceived by the public as a “good video host – not because it makes money” said one of his detractors, adding that “Aside from big YouTubers, not many people are making money off it.”\nWith over a billion users worldwide, Youtube is often subject to crooks wanting to exploit its platform for monetary gains. The difference is that while Supload users want to earn bits from their uploads, most Youtube spammers aim higher than the small amount of revenue-share provided by Google. Thus, they market more aggressively.\nSome of Youtube’s problems date back many years. In 2009, Kaspersky Lab detected a spam campaign with a link to YouTube that featured an unsolicited video advertisement. In 2014, Trend Micro discovered malicious ads on the site that can lead to malware exploit kits. In 2015, Symantec found a trend in an SMS spam campaign directing users to a YouTube video with a link to an adult website.\nPatience is a Virtue\nWendy Salomon, Nielsen\nChanging public opinion takes a long time and requires educational outreach. Wendy Salomon, vice president of reputation management at Nielsen, explained that in many cases the reputation of a given brand is directly tied to its industry.\nIt may take some time before the public stops linking startups like Supload with affiliate sites in their minds. However, Salomon believes that individual companies can overcome poor industry reputation “by focusing on their individual reputation and telling their company’s unique story.”\nFor Supload users and bitcoin promoters alike, focusing on high quality is the best tactic. Continued, steady promotions of high-quality materials have dual benefits. Not only do you make more money from the larger number of prospects, but you also help normalize that brand or product for others in the future. Mike Reilly, Supload co-founder and website programmer, told Bitcoin.com:\n\nWe are striving to be more than just an image host and want to become an entire platform that will enable users globally to monetize any type of content that they own. I believe that once the future updates are released, and as the site grows, it will become more clear to people that we are not an “affiliate link” type of website.\n\nDo you think bitcoin companies can soon break the ‘affiliate site’ stereotypes? Let us know in the comments section below. Images courtesy of Shutterstock, Youtube, Nielsen Bitcoin.com is ramping up our tools section with a variety of useful Bitcoin-related applications. There’s a price converter, paper wallet generator, a faucet, and a verifier to validate messages using the Bitcoin blockchain.

Further, Robert Kiyosaki created a similar game called ‘Cashflow’ for the modern debt-based economy based on the traditional roll-and-move gameplay.\nA Bitcoin Empire playing card.\nA fan of modern board games like Glory to Rome, Letters from Whitechapel and Dominion, Bitcoin Empire co-founder Dave Thomas, along with Ting Yi L., see their card game as an educational opportunity.\n“We created Bitcoin Empire to educate people about cash flow using modern board gaming mechanics like multi-use cards and hand management, while at the same time introducing bitcoin to a new audience,” explains the Bitcoin Empire co-designer. “Although people’s money exists as numbers on computers in the modern day, the blood, sweat and tears spent to earn that money is very real to people. But, bitcoin remains very unreal.\n“Few have a real-world association with bitcoin,” Mr. Thomas believes. Media outlets often use the physical coin by defunct startup Casascius Coins as physical representations of bitcoin, for instance, which is probably more a misrepresentation than anything. People playing Bitcoin Empire hold playing cards with the bitcoin logo on the back, using them in a similar way to cash.\n“Through this simulation of transactions, I can imagine people becoming comfortable with this new paradigm and interested in investing in crypto-currency,” the board game designer reasons. The founders hope their fifty Kickstarter backers introduce their friends and family to Bitcoin via our game.\nPlaying card featuring Pepe the Frog.\n“The core of our game and our Kickstarter campaign was the satirisation of notable Bitcoin events in the mainstream media. For example, Dorian Nakamoto being fingered as Satoshi Nakamoto and the Mt Gox incident,” explains Mr. Thomas.\nTo make the game more appealing to non-bitcoiners, Bitcoin Empire features a secret card featuring Pepe The Frog, Audrey Hepburn, Doge and Jennifer Lawrence.\nMillennials Help to Revive Board Games\nGlobal sales of games and puzzles grew from $9.3 billion in 2013 to $9.6 billion this year, claims Euromonitor International. Part of this growth is fueled by millennials, one of bitcoin’s leading age demographics.\nTo be sure, bitcoin users have critiqued Bitcoin Empire.\n“A few of them wished that the gameplay simulated the mining process to help educate people around the technology,” Mr. Thomas divulges. “But we believe that centering the game around the current Bitcoin economy will help highlight the risks of trusting third party banks and exchanges with your money. I think it’s more important to help people take the first step of investing in crypto-currency safely.”\nWould you play a Bitcoin-themed board game? Let us know in the comments!

    "title": " Last summer executives from Ark Invest and Coinbase released a paper called “Bitcoin: Ringing the Bell for a New",
    "text": "\n Last summer executives from Ark Invest and Coinbase released a paper called “Bitcoin: Ringing the Bell for a New Asset Class,” which defines the cryptocurrency as a new asset class for the 21st century. The paper written by Ark Invest’s Chris Burniske and Coinbase Vice President Adam White has recently been updated to reflect 2016’s end of the year data.\nAlso read: How to Choose the Right Bitcoin Wallet for Your Needs\nArk Invest Continues to Explore Bitcoin as the Uncorrelated Asset Class of the 21st Century\nArk Invest and the San Francisco startup Coinbase have brought their latest bitcoin report up to date with all kinds of new data. The paper’s authors believe bitcoin is a “first of its kind” type of investment with significant distinctions from traditional assets. Burniske and White explore four criteria within traditional asset classes and use economist Robert Greer’s studies as the reports reference for asset classification.\nThe newly refined report discusses bitcoin amongst traditional assets such as equities, bonds, real estate, precious metals, physical commodities, fine art, and currencies. The four specifications defined in context with cryptocurrency and traditional assets are investability, politico-economics, correlation of returns: price independence, and risk-reward profile. The first section of the report describes bitcoin investability.\n“ARK Invest and Coinbase define investability as providing ample liquidity and opportunity to invest,” explains the research paper. “Globally, bitcoin exchange traded volumes are a good measure of the liquidity available to investors.— Daily volumes have been increasing steadily, and averaged over $1.5 billion in 2016. During the month of December 2016, average exchange traded volumes were more than $4 billion per day.”\n\nVarious Interesting Factoids from Ark Invest’s Report \nSome new and interesting findings from the updated paper reveal that as of January 2017 Coinbase has stored over a $1 billion USD worth of bitcoin. Ark Invest and Coinbase estimate that more than ten million global citizens hold a portion of bitcoin. As the nascent industry matures the paper’s authors expect these numbers should swell in the future.\nThe paper also explains that trading volume achieved billion dollar daily numbers, bitcoin’s transaction volume has “topped as much as $0.5 billion in one day—and is now consistently north of $200 million daily,” explains Ark Invest. Alongside this, the paper details transactional volume during 2014 through 2016 has seen significant year-over-year growth showing bitcoin’s increased demand.\nWhen looking at bitcoin’s correlation of returns or price independence, the paper says the cryptocurrency has significant contrasts to traditional asset classes throughout the past six years. “Bitcoin is the only asset that maintains consistently low correlations with every other asset,” says the research paper.\n\nLastly, as far as risk and rewards are concerned, the paper explains bitcoin is less volatile than its early days. However, amongst the traditional assets measured within the report the cryptocurrency has the most volatility the paper explains:   \n\nWhile bitcoin’s volatility has dropped considerably, it is still the most volatile of the broad asset classes over all the periods of this analysis. However, that may not remain the case for long since over the last year bitcoin was slightly more volatile than oil.\n\nA Unique Asset Class\nAs reported in the paper a few months ago Ark Invest and Coinbase believe bitcoin is on its way to being a recognized asset class. The paper details that cryptocurrencies have various network effects and significant distinctions compared to other assets. The report is well researched with data from Coinbase, GDAX, other global bitcoin exchanges with various comparisons to conventional assets like gold. \nThe paper’s data clearly shows the bitcoin economy is increasingly growing larger heading into 2017. The media’s headlines this year calling bitcoin a new safe haven investment make more sense when compared to the report’s new statistics.\nWhat do you think about bitcoin as a new type of asset class?

    "text": "\n Bitcoin trading is a popular market that has been growing in recent years. There are many who obtain bitcoin to hold for long periods of time. However many people trade their bitcoin regularly with intra-range strategies, day trading, leverage trading and more. Often times trading can sometimes be confusing, and there are many things to consider when participating within the exchange environment.\nAlso read: The Bitpay Visa: a Bitcoin-Debit Card Review\nThe World of Bitcoin Trading \nThe price of bitcoin changes often and some would consider the digital asset to be volatile. The fact is, though, that most currencies worldwide change in value quite a bit as well. And people make money trading fiat currencies, and commodities, based on these ups and downs in price. Bitcoin trading and cryptocurrency exchanges have matured quite a bit since the early days. There are multiple trading techniques and a vast array of exchanges that offer different trading services. Today, we will discuss the various surroundings of the bitcoin trading ecosystem and what to expect from these exchange markets.\nBTC/USD candlestick chart, Poloniex on 1/5/17\nCandlestick Chart\nThe candlestick chart scheme\nThe candlestick chart is the most common chart used to technically analyze and predict Bitcoin’s price movements. The chart is used in many other markets like forex trading and national fiat currencies. This style of charting is very popular but can often be confusing to understand. Unlike bar charts there are different aspects that look at the short and long-term outlooks differently. Candlesticks reference the price of each trading session’s open, high, low, and closing positions. As the chart progresses analysts can apply different trend lines and technical indicators to try and predict price movement but in the trading world nothing is for certain.\nDay Trading and Intra-range Strategy\nOne style of bitcoin trading that’s quite popular worldwide is day trading; that is, trades speculated within the same day. This means a trader closes their position by the end of the day or within a specific time frame. Intra-range trading (intraday) is relatively the same and traders use shorter periods of time to profit off scalps and sudden fluctuations in bitcoin’s price value. Day trading strategies are driven by profit, and can lead to a lucrative occupation or the significant loss of wealth. Trading this way takes research and practice to perfect the skills good enough to profit daily.\nShorting, Long Bets, Options, and Futures Trading\nThis type of trading involves a trader placing a wager that the price of bitcoin will be lower or higher within an arranged period of time. Just recently a trader got some attention for betting on a $10 million bitcoin short position and got liquidated because the price rose significantly. This means the trader placed a bet that the price would drop, but lost, leaving the trader to buy back the bitcoin at market rate. Long positions are basically the opposite and the trader wagers that the price will be higher over time. In essence, this type of trading is like buying a good and hoping the good’s price will drop or rise with the trader profiting from the difference. \nThere are various methods of trading bitcoin options, futures, and speculative bets. Quite a few exchanges offer these types of trades but all of them require collateral just in case the customer loses. Furthermore, bitcoin futures trading can be risky and traders should hone their skills when entering into these types of bets.\nBear and Bull Markets\nTraders often refer to market conditions as “bear” or “bull” markets and sometimes use the phrases “bearish” or “bullish.” A bear market is when bitcoin’s price value drops into a downward trend with increased selling and short positions. A bull market condition references increased buying, a price rise, and traders placing long bets.\nDuring a bullish market trend, the price rises steadily and entry points often decrease. Alongside this, during a bearish market trend, investors wait for extended panic selling and entry points. Bear and bull markets often give a brief description of bitcoin’s price value and whether the price trend is up or down.\nSome Technical Terms  \n\nSimple Moving Average (SMA): The simple moving average is a calculation of the sum of the closing price divided by the total of time-frames.\nFibonacci Retracement: The technical analysis of Fibonacci retracement traces the price stops of bitcoin using horizontal lines to track both support and market resistance. Trend lines are created between ups and downs and then divided by Fibonacci ratios.   \nStochastic Oscillator: The technical indicator known as the stochastic oscillator measures the closing prices within the prices trending direction over a period of time. Furthermore, it can be used with the SMA to refine insight on market movements.\nOverbought: Often times people refer to bitcoin’s price as being overbought, which means demand or price rises are not justifiable by technical indicators and market fundamentals.\n\nTrading Is Not Easy\nA lot of people assume that trading is easy money but there are significant risks associated with this type of exchange. First and foremost, many traders leave their bitcoins on exchanges. This means they are leaving their funds in the hands of an exchange with expectations the business is responsible and secure. However traders have often learned the hard way, like in the recent Bitfinex hack and the infamous Mt. Gox disaster. Remember – if you don’t possess your private keys you really don’t own the bitcoin.\nOn the flipside, trading can be lucrative with a lot of practice, and it’s a popular environment in the bitcoin space. Additionally, lots of people trade altcoins in order to gain more bitcoin with their profits.\nAlways remember that trading can be risky and requires much practice and even plotted charts, technical indicators, and predictions can often be wrong.\nDisclaimer: Bitcoin.com trading articles are intended for informational purposes only and should not to be considered as trading advice.

    "text": "\n Recently, bitcoin’s price grew more than 50 percent in less than a month before taking a dip. What goes up comes down, how does the rally affect the bitcoin ecosystem? Bitcoin.com asked Spencer Bogart, Equity Research analyst at Needham & Company, his opinion on the recent bitcoin rally.\nAlso read: A Look At Bitcoin Bubbles, When Will the Next One Be? \nBitcoin’s Rally Likely Means More Upside\nAnalyst Spencer Bogart, who leads Needham & Company’s coverage of bitcoin, explained to Bitcoin.com what a large bitcoin rally means by comparing it to equities.\n“In the equities world, underlying earnings potential drives price,” he began. “So when you have a big rally in a given stock it eventually hits a point where you can’t justify price relative to earnings potential.” When that happens, investors with long positions will scale back thereby reducing their exposure while those with short positions “will step in more aggressively to balance the market,” he explained.\nHowever, unlike equities, bitcoin does not have underlying earnings so it “doesn’t necessarily have the same constraints,” he said and then clarified that:\n\nIn equities, a large rally typically limits further upside but in Bitcoin a large rally typically means more miners, more users, more awareness, more merchants, more startups—which, if anything, likely improves the potential for further upside.\n\nShort-Term Profit-Taking Time\nBitcoin’s price has already risen over 51 percent from the beginning of the month on Bitstamp before taking a significant 20% dip at press time on January 6.\nBogart said that “the vast majority of this rally is speculation—complimented by macro-driven demand.” While he himself is in it for the long-haul and does not want to time himself out of the market, he understands that “It’s really hard to argue with taking some profits after a 50% run.”\n“Anytime price is up more than 40% in less than a month, I’d say there’s an elevated chance of a pullback,” he revealed, but emphasized that “nobody knows when or how big it will be.” He then explained that the perception of the rally “depends significantly on how we frame this,” adding that:\n\nBitcoin up 50% in less than a month—sounds like a top and a good time to take profits. But if we frame this differently: Bitcoin went from 0.12% to 0.19% of the value of the gold market—what’s stopping it from going to 0.25%? or 1%?\n\nEven though the price has dipped below $900 at press time, in the long run, many are still optimistic. Among those foresaw high prices for bitcoin is Civic co-founder and CEO, Vinny Lingham, who predicted that the price of the digital currency will reach $3,000 late this year. “I believe this is entirely possible, but it must happen while maintaining low volatility and steady growth,” Lingham recently wrote on his blog.\nWhat do you think of the latest bitcoin rally?

    "text": "\n The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this week announced that it is delaying its decision whether to approve the listing of SolidX Bitcoin Trust on the NYSE Arca exchange.\nAlso read: SolidX Files to Become First Bitcoin ETF on NY Stock Exchange \nMeet SolidX Bitcoin Trust\nBlockchain technology company, SolidX Partners Inc, first filed a registration statement (Form S-1) with the SEC on July 11, 2016, proposing to launch its SolidX Bitcoin Trust. According to the company’s letter to the SEC in November last year:\n\nThe Trust is functionally almost identical to existing physically backed exchange-traded products, which have become an important component of the market. The Sponsor submits that it is in the public interest to permit the development of the Trust, which will enable a new and compelling investment option to investors.\n\nSolidX Bitcoin Trust will not be actively managed. There is no minimum investment. “An investor may hold as little as a single share, which represents approximately one tenth of a bitcoin,” the company told the SEC. In addition, the company has secured “significant insurance coverage for the bitcoin that will be held by the Trust.”\nSolidX’s Filing Progress\nSolidX Bitcoin Trust is to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca under the symbol XBTC. NYSE Arca is the first all-electronic exchange in the U.S. It currently trades more than 8,000 exchange-listed securities and is ranked number one in the listing and trading of exchange-traded product, according to its website. On July 12, NYSE Arca filed with the SEC to list and trade SolidX Bitcoin Trust’s shares.\nAfter the SEC repeatedly extended the period to consider approving or disapproving the listing, the Commission announced early this week:\n\nThe Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,9 designates March 30, 2017 as the date by which the Commission should either approve or disapprove the proposed rule change.\n\nIndustry Comments\nThe Commission has received seven comments from the industry. All of them were in favor of approving SolidX Bitcoin Trust except one. Ken I Maher’s short and abrupt message to the SEC urged the Commission to consider the risks of the bitcoin ecosystem.\nOther letters to the Commission includes one submitted collectively by 30 industry leaders such as 21 Inc’s Balaji Srinivasan, Bitpay’s Stephen Pair, Bitstamp’s Nejc Kodrič, Blockchain’s Marco Santori, Circle’s Joshua Lim, and Coin Center’s Jerry Brito. They urged the SEC to approve SolidX Bitcoin Trust’s listing stating that:\n\nAccess to bitcoin exposure needs to be nondiscriminatory in nature: an investor should not be excluded from this asset class merely because they are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the technological processes involved in safely procuring and holding bitcoin.\n\nDenise Krisko, President of Vident Investment Advisory LLC, told the SEC “The trust will benefit investors and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem through access to a liquid and transparent product that will further drive this innovative and exciting technology.” Joseph Colangelo, President of Consumers’ Research, told the Commission that “Bitcoin has established itself as a significant new asset class,” stating “the SolidX Bitcoin Trust will protect U.S. consumers in a way that truly bears in mind the best interest of such consumers.”\nMeanwhile, Cato Institute’s Associate Director, Thaya Brook Knight noted that “approving the rule change would ultimately promote investor protection, and would therefore forward the mission of the SEC.”\nDo you think the SEC will approve SolidX’s listing on the NYSE Arca in March?

    "text": "\n News from China is once again spreading through the bitcoin world like wildfire. It appears China’s central bank the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is visiting with the top three Chinese exchanges and assessing each companies operations. Per usual on negative rumors from China the price of bitcoin took a dive during the early hours of January 11 dropping another 15 percent to a low of US$790.\nAlso read: Price Reports and Tales From China-Dizzy Bitcoiners\nMeetings with the PBOC and Chinese Bitcoin Exchange Causes More Speculation \nChina’s central bank is currently monitoring and assessing the Chinese exchanges Huobi, Okcoin, and BTCC according to a press release from the institution. The news follows last week’s announcement that these regulatory assessments would be taking place. Reuters details the bank is looking into capital flight and anti-money laundering practices amongst other discussions like “market manipulation.”\n“The People’s Bank of China Shanghai headquarters, the Shanghai Municipal Finance Office and other units to form a joint inspection team on Bitcoin China are carrying out on-site inspections,” explains the PBOC press release. “Focusing on checking whether the scope of the enterprise beyond the scope of the market, operation, whether or not without a license to carry out credit, payment, exchange and other related business; whether there is market manipulation; anti-money laundering system implementation; financial security risks and so on.”\n\nAs soon as the news hit the ears of the cryptocurrency community the price of bitcoin starting dropping after reaching a high of $925 late in the evening January 10. Furthermore, news outlets covering the subject were quick on the draw to release stories concerning the Chinese inspections. News reports from Reuters, Yahoo Finance, the Globe & Mail, Zerohedge and many others gave details about the situation. Additionally, many cryptocurrency-centric publications also spun off stories with some of them being a bit misleading.\n\nGod. It's not a raid. Stop spreading FUD. https://t.co/rgchXsFL0b\n— Samson Mow (@Excellion) January 11, 2017 BTCC Says Community Should Approach the News With a Rational and Cautious View\nAccording to the press releases originating from Shanghai and Beijing, the inspection is merely a typical regulatory oversight. The bitcoin exchange BTCC has been the most vocal about the situation once again reaffirming the meetings were nothing to worry about. The Chinese exchange details the cryptocurrency community should use rational thinking rather than depend on speculative news sources. BTCC states via the company’s Twitter handle:  \n\nA group of regulators consisting of the SH branch of PBOC, the SH Financial Affairs office & other related govt agencies visited BTCC. During this visit, we followed up on prior discussions and shared details about our business model and operations with the group. We expect to continue with additional meetings later this week. All operations at BTCC are normal and we continue to actively work with regulators to ensure that we remain compliant. In the meantime, we urge our customers to take a rational and cautious view to news articles which speculate on the visit and discussions.\n\nJust Another Day in Bitcoin-Land \nTime and time again fear, uncertainty, and doubt has shaken up some within the bitcoin crowd. Many are leaning towards the speculation that the Chinese government is trying to curb capital flight and tighten the offshore yuan market. The price of bitcoin has sunk to new lows but is slowly rebounding in an upward trend back to $815 at press time. There has been a lot of shorting within the trading community, and many members of the Whale Club expected the bearish decline.\nThe news from China and rumors from the region is nothing new within the bitcoin community as these events have happened regularly since the cryptocurrency’s beginnings. Speculation and the game of telephone is a common occurrence for bitcoiners and is only human nature. The bottom line is the ‘Honeybadger of Money’ just doesn’t care and it’s just another day in bitcoin-land.\nWhat do you think about the announcement from the PBOC and BTCC’s follow up responses?

    "text": "\n A roller coaster ride as co-founder of Tradehill, an early Bitcoin exchange launched in 2011 that once rivaled now defunct exchange Mt. Gox, led Jered Kenna towards lifestyle brands. While working in bitcoin, things like regulation, banks and other associated headaches burned him out a bit on blockchain hype.\nAlso Read: Why Volume is Exploding at Mexican Exchange Bitso\n\nOn February 13, 2012, Tradehill announced it would shut down after its bank accounts were closed due to bitcoin involvement. (The exchange briefly could be found under the Bitcoin.com domain) Mr. Kenna is still active in the bitcoin industry. Last year he launched Trade Zero, bitcoin’s first dark pool.\nAfter Tradehill, Mr. Kenna opened Mission20, a San Francisco art and technology co-working space in San Francisco’s Mission District with a large ‘Bitcoin-Accepted Here’ electric sign visible from the sidewalk. For his latest venture, he moved to Colombia, the land of the literary style magical realism and organized crime boss Pablo Escobar.\nBitcoiner Found a Brewery with an Environmental Conscious\n“We are taking a more innovative approach,” Mr. Kenna told Bitcoin.com about his new Colombia craft brewery. “Breweries use a lot of water. Something like eight gallons of water to make a gallon of beer. We need to reduce that.”\n20Mission Brewing partnered with the Ecology department at a local university to make their brewery as efficient as possible. “We are working with Tecnológico de Antioquia, a local technical University, to reuse as much water as possible as well as rain catchment in the cooling process,” Mr. Kenna explained. “Our goal is to use 1/3 of the ground water a typical brewery uses.” The overall goal is to incorporate the flavors of local cuisines. First on their list is the Colombia location in 2017.\n\n“Right now as crazy as we’ve gotten is mixing European and American styles with fruits that I’d never heard of back home, such as Maracuya and Lulo,” Mr. Kenna told Bitcoin.com. \nThe team, which includes a former computer engineer who ran software recruiting and development companies, built its own electronic control system or TME. Basically, it’s a heat sensor that would moderate the brewery’s activities.\n“The prototype we developed and built from scratch used a Chinese PID and temperature sensors to turn the heating elements on and off and maintain the temperatures we need,” he explained. 20Mission will continue to experiment with it despite having a separate state-of-the-art system.\n\nAlong with two partners and a local brewer who previously worked for Rogue Brewery out of Newport, Oregon, Mr. Kenna founded 20Mission Brewing. The South American brewery -by-gringos boasts American, European and Colombian flavors like a Belgian Wheat Ale with passion fruit.  Mr. Kenna has partnered with Todd Morrill and Jeff Guerra, two Bay Area entrepreneurs. \nThe new ideas don’t stop there for the new brewery founded by the early and big player in the bitcoin space. \nOut With Corporate Beer, In With Independent Brewers\nThe Tradehill co-founder also has an eye on lessening the corporate hold on the local beer market in Colombia, which is dominated by Miller-owned brand, Bavaria. Miller is considered a premium brand in Colombia, and can be found on the top shelf of markets. Regional craft breweries, however, are finding success in the Central American country. They’re being purchased by big companies, as well, such as BBC (Bogota Beer Company) and 3 Cordilleras.\n“It’s going to become a lot more interesting of a market as it’s changing,” he said. “If renovation stays on track we will be the largest independently owned brewery in Colombia this June.” Will the brewery accept Bitcoin? “Until the Colombian Government tells us to stop,” Mr. Kenna confirms.\nWould you pay for craft beer with bitcoin?

    "text": "\n A recent blog post by developers of the Lightning Network, has announced an alpha release of the protocol’s daemon. The release called v0.1-alpha of the Lightning Network is said to be a milestone that enables the platform to be publicly tested by developers.\nAlso Read: The Crypto-World’s ‘Bilderberg Meeting’ is Coming Soon\nThe Lightning Network is Now Available for Testing \nWith roughly fifteen developers contributing to the v0.1-alpha Lightning release, the codebase is now available via the team’s Github repo. According to the team’s blog post, the daemon is a “full implementation of Lightning” with various capabilities.\nThis includes opening and closing channels, channel states, and onion-encrypted payments amongst the protocol’s features. The announcement gives a brief explanation of Lightning’s capabilities and how it was designed.     \n“The entirety of the ‘lnd’ codebase has been built from scratch using Go, a new systems programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software,” details the Lightning Network developers. “We chose Go due to its first-class language-level support for concurrency, expansive standard library, memory safety, and simple language design. The last point holds significance as we’ve developed the codebase for ‘lnd’ with readability in mind above all.”\nLightning’s Relationship with Segregated Witness \nSegregated Witness \nThe Lightning Network is a protocol designed to speed up transactions and help bitcoin’s technical limitations in regards to scaling. Currently, the bitcoin network can only process less than ten transactions a second, as opposed to thousands traditional payment processors handle today.\nThe off-chain protocol is based on payment channels and multi-signature technology which could theoretically speed up transactions to near instantaneous time frames. With a little help from Segregated Witness (Segwit), the Lightning developers say they can “deploy the most efficient, flexible, and safe channel design.”\nThe latest release of Lightning is meant for developer experimentation and currently supports programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, Go, and more. Furthermore, individual payment channels designed with a series of interconnected links is made possible by utilizing the Segwit framework. The blog post continuously notes the importance of Segwit by detailing the positives for using the code and negatives of Lightning not utilizing the implementation.\nEnd to End Encryption and Onion-Routed Micropayments\nAnother aspect of Lightning that people may enjoy is the implementation of onion-routed payments and end-to-end encryption between nodes. The blog post states the protocol uses a method called Hash-Time-Locked-Contract (HTLC) to deploy private micropayments. The developers detail with this feature “privacy is the default, as it should be.”\nAdditionally Lightning will enable peer-to-peer encrypted communication applying what’s called a modern cryptographic messaging transport. Within this type of messaging no information can be seen between Lightning nodes, says the development team. \nThe Lightning project has received criticism for how well it handled privacy in the past. More recently, bitcoin security expert Kristov Atlas wrote an article called “The Inevitability of Privacy in Lightning Networks,” discussing the subject of privacy with the Lightning Network.   \nContributors of the latest alpha release of Lightning include developers such as Joseph Poon, Olaoluwa Osuntokun (roasbeef), Christopher Jämthagen, and more. The development team details they look forward to working with more programmers building with this software.\n“We look forward to engaging new developers as they tinker with ‘lnd’ to create novel Layer-2 applications on top of the Lightning Network and also get a feel for what’s possible with this new technology,” adds the Lightning team.\nWhat do you think about the alpha release of the Lightning Network?

The company has provided 11,500 ATMs for users to withdraw cash from located in Spain and Poland and over 15,000 locations for purchasing bitcoin. Bitcoin.com caught up with Francesco Simonetti, Holytransaction CEO, and co-founder to discuss more details and his future plans.\nAlso read: Francesco Simonetti talks about HolyTransaction and why the wallet supports multicurrencies \nWithdraw from 11,500 ATMs\nHalcash is a Polish company which develops technology to facilitate real-time money transfers to ATMs. Holytransaction partnered with Halcash last year and launched a service called Holytransaction Trade last October, allowing users to convert bitcoin into fiat currencies and pick them up physically from an ATM. The company spent the last six months testing the trades, Simonetti told Bitcoin.com.\n\nThrough this partnership, users can convert bitcoin into Euro and withdraw cash from any bank ATMs that are part of the Halcash’s network in Spain and Poland. There are currently 7,000 Halcash ATMs in Spain and 4,500 in Poland, Simonetti said.\nHolytransaction also provides a prepaid virtual Visa card that can be loaded with bitcoin through the Trade app and used to make purchases online, anywhere that accepts a Visa card.\nBuy Bitcoin from 15,800 Locations\nFor buying bitcoin, Simonetti explained that there are 500 ATMs available in Greece to buy bitcoin as well as over 10,000 retail stores available through the Paynet network including 7Eleven and Circle K. In addition, Holytransaction has also partnered with Teleingreso, Spanish payment option that allows users to buy bitcoin through its network of more than 3000 ATMs, 2000 post offices, and 300 retail outlets.\n“When you select Teleingreso as an online payment method, the system automatically generates a unique 9-digit transaction code,” states Holytransaction’s press release. “The transaction is pending until you visit any of the locations to make a payment, and then the information is instantly provided to us.”\nAt the moment the application is available on Google Play as well as online.

    "text": "\n The European Parliament has recently released a report entitled ‘The Juncker Commission’s ten priorities: State of play at the start of 2017.’ It includes digital currencies for the first time as part of the Commission’s anti-money laundering efforts, which is a priority the Commission hopes to deliver by the end of 2017. The proposed amendments seek to reduce anonymity surrounding digital currencies including bitcoin.\nAlso read: ECB to EU: Tighter Regulations, Less Anonymity on Digital Currencies \nJuncker Commission’s Ten Priorities\nPrior to his election as President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker set\nout the policy priorities which would serve as the political mandate for his five-year term in office. With the stated aim of focusing on the ‘big things’, he outlined ten key areas in which he wanted the European Union to “make a difference and deliver concrete results for citizens,” according to the report.\nThe ten priorities were presented when he took office on November 1, 2014. His commission adopted all ten priorities during its first year in office. Right now is a critical time because the Commission is approaching the midway point of its mandates.\nThe recent report provides an overview of the work done by the Commission under Juncker’s presidency and an update of the initiatives taken for each of the ten priority areas.\nPriority 7 Includes Digital Currencies\nThe previous publication, the ‘State of play in mid-2016‘, did not mention digital currencies. However, this latest publication did for the first time, calling them ‘virtual currencies’.\nDigital currencies is part of ‘Priority 7: An area of justice and fundamental rights based on mutual trust’ under the area of ‘Fighting terrorism.’ The report outlined the Commission’s proposed amendments to the 2015 Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive in July last year, stating that “The issues addressed include safeguards for financial flows from high-risk third countries, EU financial intelligence units’ powers, centralised national bank and payment account registers, and risks linked to virtual currencies and anonymous pre-paid cards.”\nThe amendments seek to impose stricter rules on the use of digital currencies, including bitcoin, in order to reduce anonymous payments and curb the financing of terrorism, the Commission claims. Digital currency exchanges will have to increase checks on the identities of users and report suspicious transactions. The Commission wrote in the proposal that “Reducing anonymity surrounding virtual currencies will contribute to increasing trust of their good-faith users.” In addition, the proposed amendments state:\n\nObliged entities [digital currency exchanges] need to collect, process and record personal data, and sometimes to share such data with public authorities (such as FIUs) or with private entities within the same group.\n\nDigital Currencies, Part of Top Priorities\nAt the end of the report, European Parliament President Martin Schulz, Council President Robert Fico, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker jointly declared that while they will continue to work on all legislative proposals, some initiatives will be given priority treatment. This will “ensure substantial progress and, where possible, their delivery before the end of 2017,” they wrote.\nAmong the six areas of top priorities is “better protecting the security of our citizens,” the trio declared. One of the ways they suggested is through “improved instruments to criminalise terrorism and fight against money laundering and terrorist financing,” which digital currencies fall under.\nWhile the report only mentioned the end of 2017 as the promised deadline, the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive was enacted on June 25, 2015 with a two-year window for implementation. All EU members must be compliant with the new mandates by June 26, 2017. This means, the rules concerning digital currencies could also be implemented by that date.\nWhen do you think the European Commission will actually adopt the proposed Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive which includes stricter rules on digital currencies?

    "text": "\n Bitcoin has created a vast mining sector within the network’s economy that is growing exponentially. Mining bitcoin has spread the technology towards new thoughts concerning energy consumption, ways to utilize bitcoin mining’s heat source, greener energy solutions and more.\nAlso read: Chinese Bitcoin Exchange Inspections Cause Price Drop and FUD\nMaking Better Use of Bitcoin Mining’s Energy Consumption\nFlorida distillery utilizes bitcoin mining heat for rum aging.\nAs it stands today, the Bitcoin mining sector is robust with computations faster than the world’s top 500 supercomputers combined. The global bitcoin mining economy consumes nearly $500 million in electrical and operational costs. Moreover, it’s estimated the bitcoin network could use as much electricity as Denmark by the year 2020. It’s safe to say securing the bitcoin network through mining is costly and consumes a lot of energy, but may offer a myriad of other benefits to the equation.\nFor instance, mining equipment produces a significant amount of heat as the machines operate 24-7. Over the past few years, miners have found ways to utilize this heat source to warm their homes and warehouses. Just recently a South Florida distillery has used the heat from bitcoin mining equipment to accelerate rum barrel aging. Furthermore, bitcoin miners have been known to heat their homes during winter months alongside mining facilities utilizing the heat source for their benefit. It’s common for data centers to utilize the heat for many types of purposes. One example is Amazon’s data centers has provided heat to a biosphere project in downtown Seattle.\nGreener Energy\nHaoBTC’s Kangding mining operation uses hydroelectric power.\nBitcoin mining facilities use a vast array of different techniques to acquire cheap electricity and some of them with the environment in mind. Some mining operations use burning cheap coal in plants to more greener energy solutions like hydropower. There are quite a few mining facilities located in Iceland because operations make use of the cold air and geothermal steam power plants located within the region. \nIn China’s Tibetan highlands, mining operations within the region are using hydropower to offset electrical costs. Located close to the city of Kangding, the mining company HaoBTC has been using a hydroelectric power plant for cheaper electricity while at the same time treating the environment better. The idea is a far greener energy solution in contrast to the coal plants powering bitcoin mines located near the northern Inner Mongolia province.\nAll the World’s Payment Systems Consume Resources\nThere’s a lot of discussion about bitcoin’s consumption of energy. Some believe there will be the need for more hydropower plants that can produce 1,000-10,000 megawatts per plant. Others believe, in the future, bitcoin mining may even go nuclear utilizing its energy resource of 7,000 to 10,000 megawatts per energy station.\nIt’s also worth noting that all payment systems require consuming energy whether it be storage, moving physical assets, operating software and more. All of the world’s concepts of payment processing come with costs and energy consumption.\nHowever, even in its early years, bitcoin mining is showing that operators are already practicing greener energy solutions. Alongside this, some miners are learning to use the heat mining provides for other uses cases. At the exponential rate bitcoin mining is growing in the future we may see many more techniques that harness bitcoin minings energy and power in a much more useful way. For now this power is one of bitcoin’s greatest security advantages and should continue to blossom.\nWhat do you think about bitcoin’s energy consumption and the unique methods of harnessing this power for other benefits?

    "text": "\n Bitmain, which specializes in custom mining chips and miners, has come under increased scrutiny due to the Chinese firm’s control over the production of so much bitcoin hardware and hashing power. Some bitcoin participants are beginning to fear a negative outcome for bitcoin with so few producers of the digital currency’s mining hardware. \nIn 2013, companies like Black Arrow Software, Cointerra, Hashfast, Vmc, Kncminer and others offered different hardware miner models. Today, the competition for consumer-grade mining hardware has largely dwindled to two companies: Canaan and Bitmain.\nThe-Beijing based Bitmain announced Tuesday the launch of its new Antminer T9, which features fewer ASIC chips and increased power consumption over the hardware provider’s prior models, leaving questions as to how they’ve made their overall system more efficient.\nAlso Read: Why Bitcoin is Close to a Record Breaking 3 Exahashes of Processing Power\nASIC Chips a Threat To Decentralization?\nBitmain’s T9 represents a decrease in the number of hashing chips in the unit over its predecessor, the S9, which had 189 of the company’s BM1387 chips. The new T9 carries just 171. The power draw, 1400 Watts, represents an increase over the S9, as well, which drew about 1350 watts.\nASIC (short for ‘application-specific integrated circuit’) is a microchip designed for special applications.\nDue to the nature of bitcoin mining technology, the efficiency of Bitmain’s ASIC chips is considered the most important aspect of the company’s mining ‘rigs’. Bitcoiners on social media have lots of questions about the company’s plans for its ASIC chips.\n“Bitmain has emerged as a major threat to the decentralization of Bitcoin,” suggests ‘moral_agent‘ on Reddit. “They control too much of the production of mining hardware. They control too much of the hashpower.” Some wonder if a lack of competition has harmed the quality of machines available. Bitcoin mining insiders have heretofore wondered about Chinese spending on bitcoin mining.\n“We have tried to calculate the amount of money that the Chinese have invested in mining, we estimate it to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars,” CEO of now defunct Kncminer, Sam Cole, said. “Even with free electricity we cannot see how they will ever get this money back. Either they don’t know what they are doing, but that is not very likely at this scale, or they have some secret advantage that we don’t know about.”\nThe technology with which Bitmain works, to be sure, is complicated. “Producing the latest BM1387 chip based on a 16nm process node has been more technologically challenging for our engineering team than any of the previous chips had been,” Bitmain Head of Marketing Nishant Sharma told Bitcoin.com in a previous conversation. \nBitmain have increased efficiency as such, that they can use fewer chips and still reach a higher hash rate. Perhaps, the Beijing mining hardware company discovered ways to increase power to their chips without ruining them. Perhaps they’ve also managed to have the chips deliver results with less faults and/or developed a better cooling system capable of handling higher clock frequencies. If each chip is better tuned, and can handle more power, perhaps it is not that strange T9 consumes more power with fewer chips – a fact many commenters online have questioned. [We’ve reached out to Bitmain for additional comments, Editor’s note.]\nT9\nEarlier models than Bitmain’s T9, such as S7 and S9, have been credited with providing the Bitcoin blockchain with much of its processing power.\nThe T9, with 11.5 terahashes per second and the BM1387 chip available in preceding models, resembles greatly the S9, but with a lower power efficiency. It is also less expensive than the S9.\nAccording to social media reports, before the T9 came to market, Bitmain had not sold an Antminer in at least a couple of months. Interested parties were left searching eBay and Amazon for mining equipment.\nBitmain released January 13 the fifth and sixth batches of its smaller miner, the Antminer R4; at 7.5TH/s and 8.7TH/s, respectively. The company is known as one of the few companies which regularly launches new mining products.\n\nState of Mining Equipment\nThanks to an arm’s race of Bitcoin mining equipment, new Avalon and Antminer models always attract much attention.\nMining company Canaan’s most recent model is the Avalon720. The preceding Avalon 6 and 7 are considered functional pieces of bitcoin mining hardware, and to have contributed a significant amount of hashing power to the bitcoin network, but not as much as Bitmain.\n\n\nBitfury may have engineered the next best thing to Bitmain, say some, and also design their own hardware. But the company does not sell mining rigs to the general public. Rather, besides mining Bitcoin it leases hash rate and offers “blockchain services”.\nThis leaves relatively few hardware options, perhaps, for those interested in Bitcoin mining compared to how the market looked just two years ago, when there were several mining hardware manufacturers to choose from.\nWhat do you think about the state of bitcoin mining hardware in 2017? Will we see another contender enter the space in 2017? Let us know in the comments below.

    "text": "\n Coinatmradar, a website mapping and tracking trends for Bitcoin ATMs (BTMs) around the world, recently released their 2016 data as well as projected trends for 2017. According to the site, the United States is dominating the BTM market with market share of 73 percent.\nAlso read: 10,000+ EU ATMs to Cash Out Bitcoin \nAt press time, Coinatmradar displays 951 BTMs in 55 countries from 192 operators, 555 of which are located in the United States. The country with the second most BTMs is Canada with 136 BTMs, followed by the United Kingdom with 47 BTMs, the site shows. The U.S. has been dominating the market since the site started providing data in 2014. “United States of America market will be still dominating with potentially increasing its share further,” states Coinatmradar’s most recent blog post.\nThe BTM numbers do not include kiosks, retail outlets, and other machines worldwide that sell bitcoin as one of their many functions. Coinatmradar currently shows over 36,000 of non-BTM locations globally to buy bitcoin such as the Swiss railway machines and Canada’s Flexepin system. On Coinmap, there are a total number of 8,497 merchants worldwide including ATMs listed.\nBitcoin.com interviewed Vlad of CoinATMRadar about the growth trend of the BTM industry from his perspective, and why so many operators are choosing the U.S.\nU.S. Dominant Market\nBitcoin.com (BC): The BTM industry appears to be growing faster as time goes by. Where does Coinatmradar see the growth coming from?\nCoinatmradar (CAR): The U.S. is dominating bitcoin ATM market with 73% of all machines worldwide (share was growing steadily over last 2 years), most new installations happen there. Also it is usually existing operators enlarge their networks of machines, while new operators also appear, but not at that scale.\n\nThe U.S. is dominating bitcoin ATM market with 73% of all machines worldwide.\n\n\nPrivacy Concerns\nBC: Privacy has always been a huge reason for people to choose BTMs over bitcoin exchanges. Are the BTM manufacturers now only making machines that require identification?\nCAR: All top bitcoin ATM manufacturers have identification features implemented, like ID scan, phone registration per SMS etc. The other question is whether all operators use it, and it depends mostly on geographic area and what kind of regulation is there, also depends on ATM operator risks tolerance.\nFrom what I see almost all machines in regulated areas have limits and verification implemented in some form. That is the legal requirement, and not obeying can result in huge fines or even jail trial. However, there are still sometimes machines where you can buy bitcoins without registration, but I see fewer and fewer of those, as long as regulation matures.\nI mean definitely some customers use machines wearing hoods and sunglasses and supplying burn phone numbers, although it might not work in many cases.\nWhy People Use BTMs\nBut there are other categories of customers who use it not solely because of privacy reasons.\n\nIt is much easier to obtain bitcoins via machine than exchange, especially for new bitcoin users. You don’t need to register and wait for approval, also you operate with cash, and many people simply don’t have bank accounts.\n\nI’ve heard about other cases like someone was remitting money to a friend, who just went over the sell bitcoin process and showing QR code displayed at the machine to a friend over skype call, and then his friend initiated the transaction on bitcoin machine remotely by sending bitcoins to this address, which dispensed bills shortly. That was the time when 0-confirmation transactions were treated differently, I know some operators have still immediate dispensing feature depending on the amount. So this was immediate remittance transaction, and if you are at a machine which charges 7% on small amounts you are better off than using WU [Western Union] for example, given that sender already has bitcoins.\nBTMs Worldwide\nBC: North America, despite having a strong fiat currencies already, seems to get\nfar more BTMs than other regions, such as South America. Can you explain why the BTMs are being deployed so much more in there instead of where they may be needed more?\nCAR: I can only assume. There are several factors that I see: \nAn average buy-only machine costs $3,000-7,000, which can be a lot in \ndeveloping countries rather than developed, where wealth level is higher.\n\n\nCriminal activity. There are many cases of machines being stolen or damaged even in the U.S. I think the figures will be even higher in developing countries. So the risks of running these machines there are higher.\nDemand. Or lack of it. I don’t have in particular for usage of machines in South America. I know some machines in Mexico were not economically profitable and were closed down.\nRegulation. Rules are stricter there as bitcoin can be seen as an escape from existing controlled systems.\nFinancial level penetration. When you operate a machine you need to create a full closed cycle (customers provide bitcoin-to-cash conversion, so operators need to organize cash-to-bitcoin exchange). If it is harder to get access to financial services, then it is harder to organize such a business. I mean, even in the US, it is very hard to find a banking partner, who will knowingly provide access to an account. Bitcoin ATM business is connected with cash brought regularly and being deposited to an account. It is a high-risk profile for financial institutions.\n\nBC: Are any countries outright banning BTMs?\nCAR: I don’t know about the cases where bitcoin ATMs were banned in particular, usually it is about Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general.\nE.g. you can not find a single machine in Russia or India. Sometimes, it is not about a ban, but rather about very strict regulation and requirements, e.g. in Germany in order to operate a bitcoin machine you are required to obtain similar as bank level license from BaFin, which makes it practically impossible to run a machine there. There were some installed before, but closed later on, in many cases due to regulation.\nWhat do you think of the Bitcoin ATM market? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "text": "\n In a speech on Monday, Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB), discussed how the bank could design, issue, and manage a central bank digital currency for everyone, to be used alongside cash. One of the two types considered was a cash-like digital currency with anonymity.\nAlso read: Europe Committed to Tightening Digital Currency Rules by End of 2017 \nThe proposed central bank digital currency or Digital Base Money (DBM) is a digital equivalent of banknotes, representing a claim at the central bank. A form of DBM already exists, according to Mersch, in the form of central bank deposits for commercial banks. Households and non-banks, however, are excluded from this setup. The new DBM would include everyone.\nTwo Models for Central Bank Digital Currency\nMersch discussed two models for a central bank digital currency; account-based and value-based. He also said that blockchain technology has the potential to support both systems.\nYves Mersch, ECB\nFor an account-based DBM, the central bank would open an account for every interested non-bank and be directly involved in any money transfers between accounts similar to how a bank account works right now. No electronic wallet would be needed, but the central bank would be in full control of the money and could see its whole history.\nThe other option, one far closer in design to bitcoin, is a value-based DBM that is modeled after cash. Non-banks would have their own electronic wallets for holding and using the DBM. Just like cash, the central bank will not be involved in the money transfer process, there wouldn’t be a public history to follow, and funds are directly debited and credited from electronic wallets.\n“A transfer of DBM would require that the funds be debited from the payer’s electronic wallet and credited to the payee’s device without the involvement of the central bank,” Mersch explained, noting that:\n\nAnonymity towards the central bank can be achieved only with value-based DBM. These factors may influence the demand for DBM by non-banks.\n\nIncentives for Central Bank Digital Currency\nThere are two reasons why this is the right time to start thinking about the mechanics of introducing a central bank digital currency, according to Mersch.\nFirstly, public demand for a central bank digital currency could rise as the popularity of electronics payments increases. Currently, commercial banks offer various electronic payment methods including credit card, debit cards and prepaid cards. Mersch claims that, “People may prefer to hold claims on the central bank to avoid the risk that the commercial bank defaults.”\nSecondly, new technological developments such as “blockchain” could make introducing DBM “much easier and potentially less expensive than ten years ago,” he added. No mention was given to Bitcoin.\nCash Won’t Be Abolished\nCiting speculations that central banks will abolish cash, Mersch stressed, “if DBM for non-banks were introduced, it would exist alongside cash for the foreseeable future.” The central bank digital currency “would merely be an additional option for non-banks to hold funds,” he added.\nWhile in some European countries, such as Sweden and Denmark, cash usage is low and sinking, in the Euro area Mersch revealed “the growth in demand for banknotes has by far exceeded that of economic output.”\nBefore the DBM could be issued, the ECB needs to better understand the options available and their implications, Mersch said. “We need to be sure not only that DBM is unlikely to have negative economic side-effects, but also that the relevant systems are operationally efficient and safe.”\nWhat type of digital currency do you think the ECB would introduce?

    "text": "\n Bitcoin is a revolutionary experiment that may disrupt the world’s financial markets and society’s norms in more ways than one. Everyone has their own ideas of how they envision bitcoin being used ranging from a libertarian-style abolitionist standpoint to a statist who believes governments should be heavily involved with the cryptocurrency economy. The question is how will these conflicting visions work with the bitcoin network in the future?\nAlso read: The Digital Revolution Increases Sovereignty\nVices\nThere are many people who believe bitcoin is the perfect solution for black market trade, tax evasion, and other frowned upon activities. Cryptocurrencies seem to be working well with these types of exchanges as darknet markets, gambling sites, and sex workers are using bitcoin for their operations. The reason bitcoin is so appealing to these kinds of markets is because bitcoin is censorship resistant and allows the end user to decide how their wealth is spent. \nHowever, there are a bunch of people who believe these types of unfavorable activities taint bitcoin’s image. People take issue with concepts like the Silk Road and complain about cryptocurrency gambling sites. Many individuals with statist-like opinions feel bitcoiners shouldn’t participate in these deeds and that vices are bad news for adoption. Furthermore, there are a handful of individuals and groups that actually believe government needs to legitimize cryptocurrencies with laws and definitions from bureaucrats.\n\nThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\n\nThe Libertarian Ideals of the Early Cypherpunks\nIn the early days, the core supporters of bitcoin definitely leaned heavily towards libertarian ideals, and many of them were cypherpunks. These types of activists were strong proponents of cryptography and privacy-centric technology. Cypherpunks used their own mailing lists to communicate using email chains like the Cryptography mailing list. Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto had used these mailing lists to announce the bitcoin protocol and communicated with a few cypherpunks such as Wei Dai. One particular conversation between Dai and Nakamoto showed bitcoin’s creator meant for the protocol to be completely free from third parties.\n“The system is entirely decentralized, without any server or trusted parties,” details Nakamoto.  “The network infrastructure can support a full range of escrow transactions and contracts, but for now the focus is on the basics of money and transactions.”\nThroughout this era, there were many cypherpunks that held similar decentralized ideals much like Satoshi. At the time there were very vocal cypherpunks such as Julian Assange, Timothy May, and Eric Hughes. These activists had great conversations about technology liberating society from tyrannical governments. Many of them wrote manifestos that detailed how these decentralized protocols would disrupt the fraudulent banking system and the nation states. Satoshi certainly seemed to like libertarian fundamentals and expressed this many times in conversation. In November of 2008 Nakamoto states:\n\nIt’s very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I’m better with code than with words though.\n\nWhat We Allow is What Will Continue \nWith the growing number of individuals and groups pushing for cryptocurrency regulatory framework and even some bolstering centralized blockchain concepts, it’s getting harder to see the cypherpunk fundamentals of the past. It’s difficult to forecast what side bitcoin will please as the two ideological positions are very opposite.\nBitcoin is an open source protocol with no ideology, and only people hold these types of values. So, in the end, the choice of what bitcoin will ultimately disrupt will be in the hands of the users. However understanding the ideals of bitcoin’s creator is good to know and the cypherpunk activists Nakamoto conversed with. There’s no doubt bitcoin’s original design was meant to bolster decentralization backed by strong cryptography.\nYet Satoshi had left in 2010 leaving the protocol open and public domain. There’s no anonymous figure here anymore to give us advice or lend a hand with the code. Bitcoin is an exciting experiment that is now left in the hands of society and our human elements. As bitcoin becomes more mainstream, we can’t predict what will happen to the central banks and nation states. All we can do is reference some of the things Satoshi said in the past and hope the grand experiment continues to gain volume. As Satoshi once stated, “I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large [Bitcoin] transaction volume or no volume.”\n“Yes, we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years,” said Satoshi Nakamoto. “Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled network like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.”\nDo you think bitcoin is a tool to gain more freedom?

    "text": "\n The bitcoin hash rate currently nears 3 exahashes, representing an all-time high for the processing power of the Bitcoin network. The escalating hash rate concurs with continuing social media reports that Beijing-based Bitmain Technologies Limited, a company which supplies bitcoin mining equipment, suffers consistent supply shortages due to high demand.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Mining Intensifies in Q4 2016\nHow the Hash Rate Increases\nAt a time when increasing numbers of individuals and organizations are considering mining bitcoin (Berkeley’s ET research effort SETI showed interest last week for example), and the bitcoin hash rate has skyrocketed past all time highs, there could be a shortage of equipment amid increasing interest in bitcoin mining.\n\nConsumers and mining enthusiasts have reported shortages since the fall of the Antminer R4 and S9, newer rigs which experts cite as responsible for much of the increase in the hash rate. If new generations of miners are more efficient than previous ones then the total exahash rate should increases approximately by that difference over the time it takes to replace the bitcoin mining industry’s current hardware. Any shortages would prolong the time it took to get new mining rigs ‘into the wild.’\n“Global bitcoin hash rate is proportional to current bitcoin value and the efficiency of current generation hardware with a lag time”, Con Kolivas, the mining pool ‘CKPool‘ founder, tells Bitcoin.com. “Any spikes you see follow new generation hardware being released at the rate hardware is being released and the rest of the rise lags behind the changes in bitcoin value.”\nThe correlation between hash rate and Bitcoin value is complex. Mr. Kolivas suggests, though, there is a cause-and-effect interplay.\n“Mining does not affect value,” Mr. Kolivas says. “Value affects mining hash rate. The hash rate rises follow the releases of the Antminer S7 and S9 along with the Avalon 6 and 7.” There have been no reports of shortages at Canaan, the manufacturer of Avalon bitcoin mining equipment.\nBitmain is currently in the process of building another data center in China’s North Western province of Xinjiang.\n“The planned data center would be capable of consuming up to 135 megawatts of power, which will add it to the list of the highest powered data centers in the world,” the company wrote in a press release. “Wind and solar energy would be the primary source of power for the data center. It is specially designed for high-performance computing and, considering the interest of most investors in the data center, mining of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin will be its major application.”\nDespite increasing interest in bitcoin mining, Google search queries, according to Google Trends, remain far off its all-time highs set in the winter of 2013-2014.\nIncreased 190% On The Year\nOn January 1, 2016 the hash rate per second was 707,457 TH/S. Nearly one year later, the hash rate was 2,050,572 TH/S or nearly a 190% increase on the year. For the Bitcoin hash rate, this marks the single largest gain in a one year period yet.\nStarting in the second half of 2015, the Bitcoin hash rate, the overall computing power of the miners on the network, made dramatic gains – more so than in any previous year.\n\nYou can see in the chart below how, even when compared to 2013 as the Bitcoin price reached an all-time high of $1122, the contemporary hash rate is dramatically higher.\nWhat is the Bitcoin Hash Rate?\nThe hash rate, a measuring unit of the processing power being used to solve intensive mathematical operations for the Bitcoin network, refers to how powerful Bitcoin miners are collectively. Blockchain.info defines hash rate as, “The estimated number of terahashes per second (trillions of hashes per second) the Bitcoin network is performing.” \nThe term ‘difficulty’ measures how difficult it is to crack a code to discover a hash below or above an expected value. Currently, the Bitcoin network is expected to create 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes, though this varies. \nThe hash function used in Bitcoin is the cryptographic model SHA-256. Hash functions, deterministic yet unpredictable, have led to a hardware-based arm’s race in which increasingly faster Bitcoin mining hardware is continually developed to compute the SHA-256 computational puzzles that must be cracked to mine bitcoins. Much such hardware came online at the end of 2015 and into 2016, contributing to the exploding hash rate. \nWhat do you think about the hash rate in 2016?

    "text": "\n Over Part 1 and Part 2 of this series we have come a long way to proving how disconnected the legacy financial system is to natural law. We have also seen how perfectly aligned bitcoin works with nature’s frameworks. Now let’s drive the point home by looking at two more fundamental laws of nature.\nValue Based vs Debt Based\nIf a squirrel doesn’t collect enough nuts before through winter he will go hungry or even starve. A farmer can’t dig up next year’s harvest now. The squirrel and farmer alike must devote time and energy before receiving the rewards. In nature, you reap what you sow, but you must sow first.\nValue must be created before it is spent. This is the essence of a value based system. This is not to say that loans are bad at all but just that the origin of the loans should be value that was earned not created out of this air. Bitcoin is a value based system. Bitcoin miners must devote time and energy into the network in order to have a chance of obtaining new bitcoins. No new bitcoins are promised ahead of time. Just like gold’s value is proportional to the time and energy it takes to dig it out of the ground, the presence of a bitcoin is proof that time and energy has been spent in creating it.\nThe United States financial system used to be value based. Pre-1971 the US system was on the “gold standard.” This meant that all the money was backed by gold sitting somewhere in a vault. Every dollar was redeemable for a certain amount of gold or silver. But just like every government in history, eventually the US wanted something for nothing. They went off the gold standard and started issuing money that was nothing more than a ledger entry backed by a promise to pay.\nSee also: Bitcoin is Tapping into the Laws of Nature Part 1\nThe money in fiat systems around the world (like the USD) requires no more time and energy to create than it does to enter a number into a database. The fact is that nowhere in nature can you reap rewards without doing the work. This leads us to the most unbreakable of nature’s laws…mathematics.\n“In nature you reap what you sow, but you must sow first”\nGoverned by Mathematics vs Governed by People\nNo set of laws are as unbreakable as those found in mathematics. Maths is indeed the language of the universe. We can’t have a popular vote to change the fact that 2 + 2 = 4. However, voters in Switzerland recently voted on a universal basic income (free money).\nWhile bitcoin is not regulated by any government or corporation, it is still regulated. It is regulated by maths. Mathematics regulates how and when bitcoin is created, stored and spent. We know what the inflation rate of bitcoin will be 100 years from now.\nOn the other hand, fiat currencies are governed by imperfect people. Countless hours and billions of dollars are spent every month trying to second guess the interest rate movements by central banks around the world. Imagine if these resources were put towards something that actually added value. Also, government printing money in the form of bail outs, quantitative easing, helicopter money or what ever you want to call it, is an attempt to make something out of nothing. People cannot make 0 + 0 = 2.\nFrom the fall of the Roman Empire to the “too big to fail” bail outs in 2008, the history of money is the history of those in power failing their people. Regardless of your political view, which do you trust more… politicians or mathematics?\n[clickToTweet tweet=”Which do you trust more, politicians or math? #bitcoin goo.gl/tsEJAX via @BTCTN” quote=”Which do you trust more…politicians or mathematics? #bitcoin”]\nLet us have a look at the table.\nLaws of Nature\nBitcoin VS Fiat\n\n\n\n \nNature\nBitcoin\nFiat  \n\n\nSurvival Of The Fittest\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Improvement\n\n\n\n\n\nAntifragile\n\n\n\n\n\nPermissionless Innovation\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovation at the Edges\n\n\n\n\n\nValue Based\n\n\n\n\n\nGoverned By Mathematics\n\n\n\n\n\n Conclusion\nI mentioned in Part 1 of this series that this would be a tip of the iceberg discussion. Hopefully, it now makes sense to judge our current systems a little more critically. However, it is incorrect to say that current financial systems are not natural. They are as much from nature as we are. They just have a history of being ineffective and go against the blueprints of effective systems the universe has repeatedly shown us. Any seasoned sailor would advise that it is foolish go against mother nature.\nIt would be wise if we paid attention to the wisdom that surrounds us. Bitcoin is tapping into that wisdom and leading us to uncharted territory with limitless possibilities.\nIf you liked the article please share it and let me know.

    "text": "\n The number of blocks mined using the alternative Bitcoin client, Bitcoin Unlimited (BU), is increasing. Over the past weeks and months BU, also known as BUIP 001, has seemingly been increasingly adopted by Bitcoin participants. \nBitcoin Core, the most-run Bitcoin mining client, still mines 600 more blocks per 1,000 than BU and remains for now as Bitcoin’s “main” consensus client.\nAlso Read: Interview with Bitcoin Unlimited Developer Andrew Stone\nThe “quiet” adoption, which has seen BU go from 0 blocks to 200 blocks per 1000 in less than six months, could signal a changing of the guard of sorts in terms of which development pools have gained the trust of the ‘Bitcoin Community’ (especially from the miners securing the network). It’s a result of the so called Bitcoin ‘block size debate’, as new solutions for Bitcoin malleability and block size are imagined by new names. If you are new to Bitcoin these are highly technical and difficult subjects to fathom, and many high-strung debates rage continuously in online forums on the matter.\nBitcoin Unlimited Enjoying Growth in Adoption\nMining pools ViaBTC, India’s GBMiners and Bitcoin.com are examples of pools mining with BU, and comprise currently altogether approx. 13% of the Bitcoin network, bringing the total signaled support for BU up to approx. 17%. In the meanwhile, the development teams behind Bitcoin Classic (another such protocol “upgrade” proposal) and Bitcoin Unlimited have all but merged, and each actively endorse the close relationship between the projects.\nAlso Read: Added Support For BU as Pools Show Preference for Different Scalability Solutions\nA new, ‘mysterious’ mining pool, located at the domain address BTC.Top and going by the moniker “Leite BTC Mining”, adopted BU at the end of December when the pool had about 1% of the total hash rate of the Bitcoin network. The Shanghai incorporated miner now has 3.3% of the total hash rate.\nThe following chart demonstrates how, in just the past week, Bitcoin Unlimited historical Blocks per 1000 have reached their all-time high.\n\nWhile Segwit had reached nearly 25% of explicit mining pool support in December, that lion’s share has decreased over the past month. Bitcoin Unlimited at the time of writing had 17.70% of overall support. Segwit was at the same time at 22.22%, after having dipped down to 17% a few hours earlier. Many have called BU’s recent hash rate gain more of a dip in Segwit adoption than anything else.\n\nSince October, the number of Bitcoin Unlimited Nodes, to be sure, has skyrocketed.\n\nWhile adoption rates for Segwit have flatlined.\n\nWith all this in mind, Segwit still dominates the number of blocks mined.\n\nJust F2Pool and Antpool alone, both of which signed a 8MB recommendation in support of a block size increase but have not adopted alternative clients, could send BU over the 50% support level if they decide to start supporting BU.\nWhat is Bitcoin Unlimited?\nAn alternative client, BU addresses scalability by enabling miners to mine blocks greater than 1MB. BU has pledged support for the Lightning Community and other off-chain technologies. BU developer Andrew Stone says Segwit represents “needless complexity added to the blockchain.”\nMr. Stone told Bitcoin.com’s Jamie Redman: “[Segwit] does not scale enough to interest any companies in creating Bitcoin products or services, it does not even scale enough to significantly deploy off-chain scaling solutions.”\nBitcoin Civics 101\nThe trend shows Segwit losing hash power and BU gaining. While in many ways this may represent a future changing of the guard for bitcoin, developers for ‘BU’, ‘Bitcoin Classic’ and even ‘Core’ insist to Bitcoin.com that relationships between Bitcoin developers are mostly amicable.\n  ",

    "text": "\n The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) reaffirms that bitcoin is an “official” US name for virtual currency. Incidentally, many find the name Bitcoin an “unattractive” brand name. Indeed, some have been calling for replacing its name, and its differing logos, to prevent Bitcoin’s demise. Critics also point out that Bitcoin still lacks a proper currency symbol.\nNevertheless, defying marketing orthodoxy, Bitcoin outperformed fiat currencies for two years in a row. \nAlso read: Bitcoin Symbol Left Out of Unicode’s Latest Version\nIssues with the Bitcoin Brand Name\n\nNew York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) just approved Coinbase as a virtual currency and a money transmitter. In the respective press release of January 17, 2017, DFS explicitly refers to bitcoin, without capitalization, when referring to virtual currency, “Coinbase, which is subject to ongoing supervision by DFS, offers services for buying, selling, sending, receiving, and storing bitcoin.”\nBitcoin with capitalization refers to the concept or the network itself.\nGood branding is a crucial tool, by which consumers identify and differentiate a product. The purpose of a brand name is also to attract and hold loyal consumers. Bad branding, on the other hand, leaves consumers unresponsive to the product or just turns them away.\nBrand name changes are often in the news. For example, Google changed to Alphabet, and Phillip Morris became Altria.\nMost recently, Yahoo Inc. announced that part of Yahoo is changing its name. The new name is Altaba. According to CNBC, “Experts say the renamed company could be a way for Yahoo to shake off its recent problems, with two data breaches affecting a total of 1.5 billion user accounts in 2016, as well as being a requirement of the deal.”\nMany feel uneasy with the Bitcoin name, and some have even been calling for a new name.\nGuy Lepage, Partner at Blockstack, wrote an article entitled “Bitcoin has a brand problem,” in November 2015. In it, Lepage specified a list of reasons supporting his call to rename Bitcoin.\nOne of Lepage’s many objections is the name. “Plastic coins. The term evokes imagery of plastic coins from your childhood. This is a great example of what not to do when naming a product or technology. A little marketing research at the naming stage would have raised awareness that the finance industry takes their money very seriously and having a fun, playful name does not appeal to this audience.”\nLepage’s article concludes with an appeal to have the Bitcoin name changed. Otherwise, Lepage predicts, “I fear without this change, it could be another 10 years before this network really takes off — if at all.”\nBitcoin’s Logo versus Bitcoin’s Currency Symbol\nBitboy, a Bitcoin Forum user, claims to be the author of the logo, which is an inclined, bold capital letter serif B, traversed by two vertical lines.\nGranted, the Bitcoin logo it is not a designer’s. It is not stylish or elegant. The logo does not convey all that Bitcoin represents.\nMost importantly, Bitcoin is not a company, product or brand to have a logo, says Melissa Volkmann, Lead Designer, HashRabbit Inc.\nBesides, Bitcoin’s logo is not a currency symbol, points out bitcoinsymbol.org. “Currencies are represented by symbols like $, € or ¥, aiming to be used everywhere by everybody.”\nIn October 2015, Ken Shirriff submitted a proposal to Unicode, to have the currency symbols, the serif capital B with the two vertical strokes, added to the standard. As a result, in November 2015, Unicode recommended its integration into the Unicode standard. However, as Bitcoin.com reported in July 2016, the Unicode standard, version 9.0, excluded the Bitcoin’s currency symbol.\nEven if Bitcoin’s currency symbol is eventually included in the Unicode standard, Bitcoinsymbol.org dismisses U+20BF and demands the Unicode character U+0243, Ƀ instead.\n\nThe bitcoinsymbol.org project’s primary objective is to find the right symbol for Bitcoin. You can participate and share your ideas about this project here.\nMicrosoft Will Support Bitcoin\nUnicode character U+0243\nThe good news is that Microsoft will soon include a Bitcoin symbol in its Excel Accounting and Currency formats.\n“In 2017, Excel will be able to recognize, format, calculate, and analyze numbers expressed in Bitcoin currency. The new feature will be available for Excel running under Windows 10, Android, Mac OS, and iOS, and will include Excel Mobile versions as well,” says Martin Butler, Account Executive, Globals at Microsoft.\nOffice Watch expects Microsoft to use the Unicode character Ƀ.\nNevertheless, regardless of its unmarketable brand name or logo, and the fact that it lacks an official currency symbol, Bitcoin, thanks to its inherent virtues, is the most successful cryptocurrency. Indeed, as reflected by its performance, and ever-greater adoption rates, Bitcoin is on the path to becoming a prominent world currency.\nWhat are your thoughts about changing the Bitcoin name or logo?

    "text": "\n Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) wants to be listed on NYSE Arca, according to a registration statement filed Friday with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This is the second proposed Bitcoin investment trust listing on the exchange. The first, Solidx Bitcoin Trust, has yet to be approved by the SEC. Using Solidx as a model, it could take the Commission until October to make a decision whether to approve or disapprove BIT’s listing.\nAlso read: SEC Delays Decision on SolidX Bitcoin Trust \nAs Donald Trump prepared to be inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States on January 20, Barry Silbert filed a registration statement with the SEC seeking an initial public offering (IPO) for his flagship fund BIT. BIT’s shares are to be listed under the symbol GBTC on the NYSE Arca.\nThe IPO\n“This is an initial public offering of the Trust’s Shares,” BIT’s registration statement reads. The shares “are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in Bitcoin.” Grayscale Investments, LLC is the sponsor of the Trust, Delaware Trust Company is the trustee, the Bank of New York Mellon is the transfer agent, as well as the administrator, and Xapo Inc. is the custodian. The annual fee for investors will remain at 2 percent. The proposed maximum offering is $500 million of the Trust’s shares.\nSilbert’s Grayscale Investments, LLC simultaneously announced that it “has ceased its ongoing private placement and will no longer issue shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust through its previous 506(c) private placement.” However, BIT’s shares will continue to be quoted in the secondary market over-the-counter on OTCQX under the symbol GBTC while the registration with the SEC is pending approval. GBTC currently has assets under management of $164.21 million as of the end of December 2016.\nPossible Time Frame\nA possible time frame for the SEC to either approve or disapprove BIT’s listing on the NYSE Arca can be estimated using Solidx Bitcoin Trust as an example. Solidx originally filed with the Commission to list on the NYSE Arca on July 11, 2016.\nAfter the company’s initial filing, the next step will be for the exchange to file with the SEC “a proposed rule change to list and trade shares” under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.201. For Solidx, the NYSE Arca filed with the SEC on July 13, 2016, which was two days after Solidx filed. Given that BIT’s filing was on a Friday, the NYSE Arca could file with the SEC early next week.\nThen the proposed rule change would be published for comments in the Federal Register. This usually happens between two to three weeks after a filing with the SEC. For Solidx, it was published on August 2, 2016, approximately three weeks after filing. That means the proposed rule change for BIT should be published in the Federal Register sometime in the second or third week of February.\nAfter publishing in the Federal Register, the Commission has 180 days to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change. However, it can also extend that period by a maximum of 60 days if necessary, which is a total of 240 days from the publication in the Federal Register. For Solidx, the SEC has already chosen to extend the consideration period as long as it could to March 30, 2017.\nFor BIT, 180 days from a likely date of publication in the Federal Register would be early August and 60 days after that would be early October.\nLikelihood of Approval\nThe SEC has a habit of delaying making decisions on Bitcoin investment funds as seen by the delay for Solidx, taking the maximum time allowed by the Securities Exchange Act. Recently, Needham & Company, which provides investment coverage of BIT, suggested that the chance of the SEC approving Bitcoin ETFs is very low, at less than 25 percent.\nPresident Trump\nAccording to Needham, there is no more extension available for the Commission after the 60 days. The firm also suggested that the Commission may not make a decision by the deadline, in which case “the proposed rule change is automatically approved,” Needham’s report reads. The firm believes this will increase the likelihood of an ETF being approved. Then, there’s the ‘Trump factor.’\nThe new administration may be more Bitcoin friendly than the previous administration. “We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers,” President Trump recently said.\nDo you think the SEC will approve BIT’s listing by October?

    "text": "\n By Bitcoin.com CEO, Roger Ver\n(Editor’s Note: This article was originally published in August of 2015 and was immediately censored from /r/Bitcoin and several other places. The version below has been updated to recommend support for Bitcoin Unlimited.)\nRecently there has been an uproar in the Bitcoin community over a potential increase of the Bitcoin block size. There are many people I respect deeply on both sides of this issue, but unfortunately we’ve seen some members of the community resorting to outright censorship in order to stop the debate. Censorship is never the answer. The reason myself and many others became interested in Bitcoin was because of its ability to resist financial censorship. Let’s not inflict upon ourselves the very thing that Bitcoin was designed to help prevent.\nCurrently, many people seem to be under the false impression that bigger blocks mean fewer full nodes on the Bitcoin network, leading to more centralization, and a higher likelihood of governments being able to subvert, censor, or otherwise control Bitcoin. If this were true, I would certainly oppose any increase to the block size, but I think this is clearly wrong for several reasons.\nBitcoin, the honey badger of money\n\nCurrently a very modest internet connection, available in most of the world, can easily support blocks more than one hundred times what is in use today.\nA $100 USD hard drive would take the better part of a century worth of full blocks to fill up at the current block size limit.\n\nClearly, bandwidth and storage are not limiting factors to increasing the block size. Moore’s law will continue to make these factors even less of an issue in the future.\nCurrently, there are about 6,000 full nodes running on the bitcoin network, with a rough estimate of 6,000,000 Bitcoin users. That means about 0.1% of Bitcoin users bother to run a full node.\nI think it is a fair assumption that most of these 6,000 people, myself among them, are running full nodes simply because they are interested in Bitcoin, and it is likely that this percentage will not change more than an order of magnitude into the future.\n\nThe current version of Bitcoin Unlimited can easily increase the block size limit to 8MB. An 8x block size increase means there would be room for eight times as many Bitcoin users, so that would mean up to at least 48M users from the current estimated 6M. 0.1% of 48M would be potentially 48,000 full nodes. Even if the participation rate of people running full nodes drops by half, we still have 24,000 full nodes or more than four times the current amount.\nIn short, I think it should be clear to everyone that bigger blocks will likely mean more full nodes around the world, and therefore more decentralization, not less. This will make Bitcoin even more difficult to control, censor, or be stopped by anyone, including governments. If you want Bitcoin to become an even bigger Honey Badger of money, we need to increase the block size, not limit it. If you want to show your support for bigger blocks today, you can do so by running a full node with the software from xtnodes.com\nLet me know why you think raising the block size is a good or bad idea in the comment section below. I’ll do my best to participate in the discussion as well. Images Courtesy of Reddit, Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\nRoger Ver began his bitcoin journey in March of 2011.

    "text": "\n Needham & Company LLC, released a note for investors Thursday on the ‘Economic and Financial Turmoil Driving Bitcoin Interest & Adoption’. The note discusses various indicators the firm believes would propel increased bitcoin adoption going forward, such as capital controls, demonetization, hyperinflation as well as bitcoin bans. Some factors may seem negative at first but Needham believes they ultimately drive bitcoin interest and adoption.\nAlso read: Needham: Probability of Approval for a Bitcoin ETF ‘Very Low’ \nThe company is a nationally recognized investment banking and asset management firm focused solely on growth companies. Since its inception, it has acted as lead or co-manager in over 785 public offerings.\nBanning Bitcoin Does Not Have the Desired Effect\nNeedham analyst and author Spencer Bogart explained that some countries will inevitably ban or place onerous regulation on Bitcoin.\n“While these actions certainly don’t benefit Bitcoin adoption, they typically don’t prevent it either,” he noted, adding that:\n\nWhile some countries have either banned bitcoin or enacted prohibitive regulations, we note that the results appear to be the opposite of the intended effect: interest in bitcoin has skyrocketed in some countries that have banned bitcoin.\n\nCiting Bangladesh as an example, Bogart referenced the Central Bank’s bitcoin ban in September 2014 which imposed 12 years of jail time for offenders. Using bitcoin’s share of internet search queries as a proxy for interest in bitcoin, he said in 2016, the country subsequently became number seven globally with the highest bitcoin interest.\n“Interestingly, the top rising related topics and queries all appear geared toward genuine usage (searches for popular wallets, conversion rates, etc) as opposed to activity related to scams/Ponzi schemes or regulatory news,” he added.\nLikewise, Bolivia, which banned bitcoin in mid-2014, also saw a spike in bitcoin interest and ranks number eight overall for relevant search terms.\n\nThe phenomenon Bogart describes for search interest in countries where bitcoin has been outlawed is well explained by the Streisand effect, which states that censorship often has unintended consequences, and those who are censored from information will be likely to seek it out even more vigorously than before.\nSome Other Factors Driving Bitcoin Adoption\nSome other factors driving bitcoin adoption discussed in the note are capital controls, demonetization, and hyperinflation across several countries which Bogart claimed are propelling bitcoin’s rising interest and adoption worldwide.\nFor example, India banned large bills last November and bitcoin’s interest, based on internet search volume and well as trading volume, surged and bitcoin usage has tripled since the ban, Bogart explained.\nIn Nigeria, the rate of inflation has nearly doubled over the past year to 19% which is accompanied by “a rapid increase in search interest for Bitcoin within the country,” he said, adding that in Venezuela the hyperinflation (180%+) problem has been plaguing the economy and it is “driving a surge in Bitcoin interest and trading volume.” Overall, he concluded that:\n\nInterference in the storage and flow of capital is driving global interest in bitcoin.\n\nWhile some countries have opted to ban bitcoin, there are others that have embraced it, which Bogart acknowledged in his note. For example, Switzerland has added the ability to buy bitcoin at any of the National Swiss Railway ticket kiosks, of which there are over a thousand spread around the country. Paying utilities with bitcoin is also possible in the Swiss town Zug. In addition, the country is also reportedly developing a potential licensing of “crypto-banks” which would “create a new category of financial institutions that are able to handle cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin,” Bogart described.\nThe note also revealed the United States trails 20 other countries in bitcoin interest as revealed by bitcoin’s share of internet search queries. “While much of the initial venture activity and interest in bitcoin came from within the United States, international interest has surged,” the note reads. Caracas (Venezuela), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Sandton (South Africa), and Lagos (Nigeria) all exceed the interest from San Francisco and New York, the note revealed.\nDo you think banning bitcoin will prevent adoption?

    "text": "\n The currency with the fifth-highest Bitcoin trading volume today is the South Korean Won, already surpassing some larger financial centers such as the UK, Russia, and Indonesia. The country’s Bitcoin adoption is accelerating, and several factors indicate that it could outpace most other countries soon.\nAlso read: Korea Steadily Becoming a Cryptocurrency and Fintech Hub \nKorea, with a population of over 50 million, has a large remittance market. The most recent World Bank estimates show remittance inflows of $6.7 billion and outflows of more than $8.3 billion for Korea.\nKorbit, the first bitcoin exchange in the country with 33,500 registered traders, is one of the top two exchanges by volume. Through its product called Hyphen, the company offers a service which helps businesses send payments to any bank account in 30 countries globally using bitcoin.\nBitcoin.com caught up with Tony Lyu, Korbit CEO, to discuss why Korea looks set for an explosive growth in Bitcoin adoption.\nSouth Korea is Very Bitcoin-Friendly\nBitcoin.com (BC): Bitcoin can be easier bought in South Korea than most other countries. How did Korea become so Bitcoin-friendly?\nKorbit (KB): Koreans are inherently familiar with virtual currencies. Korean gaming companies such as Nexon pioneered in-game virtual currencies in free-to-play games in the early 2000s. A major bank (KEB Bank) even created a virtual branch in a Korean social network (Cyworld) to provide banking services for the network’s digital token.\nAs such, Koreans have gone past the “if” phase of virtual currencies, and even the “when” phase, and is now at the “which” phase, as in, “which virtual currency is most useful for my needs?” For some use cases, Bitcoin is the answer.\nLarge and Growing Remittance Market\nBC: Korea is consistently among the top countries for Bitcoin trading volumes worldwide. Can you explain how Bitcoin as a payment method has been growing?\nKB: Bitcoin for merchant payments has not yet taken off in Korea, probably because alternative methods of electronic payment are already widespread.\nBitcoin for international remittances, however, is popular. I believe this use case has been a significant driver for the growth in trading volume in Korea.\nBC: Do many people use your service for remittances?\nKB: Yes, we see a lot of expat workers signing up to Korbit to take advantage of bitcoin for international transactions. They can be English teachers from developed countries such as the US, or migrant workers from developing countries such as the Philippines.\n\nRemittance companies are also using bitcoin in the back-end of their services. So, many customers in Korea are using bitcoin and benefiting from it without even being aware of it.\n\nBitcoin has already taken a significant market share for some remittance corridors originating from South Korea. An article on Quartz estimated that 20% of Korea-to-Philippines remittance volume is settled in Bitcoin.\nWhy Adoption Should Spike\nBC: How fast do you expect Bitcoin adoption in Korea to grow going forward?\nKB: I expect Korean bitcoin adoption to outpace that of most other countries this year, as the Korean government introduces bitcoin exchange licensing regulations and clarifies the regulatory status of bitcoin-based cross-border remittances.\n\nI expect Korean bitcoin adoption to outpace that of most other countries this year.\n\nBC: Can you describe the South Korean government’s stance on bitcoin? Are they more accepting of bitcoin than most other governments? What reasons do they have to be open to bitcoin?\nKB: Korea’s Financial Services Commission has said they will propose regulatory frameworks for Bitcoin-based businesses this year. Many Korean technology companies are competitive globally, but few, if any, Korean financial companies can say the same.\nBitcoin provides a great opportunity for Korean fintech companies to compete in the global market without the disadvantage of being held back by Korea’s local currency. It seems like the Korean government recognizes this and is looking to support Korean Bitcoin companies venturing into the global market.\nWhich currencies do you think the Korean Won will surpass this year?

    "text": "\n Developers recall a time when they were “all just developing for ‘Bitcoin.’” Many to this day make clear they don’t belong to any ‘team’ submitting protocol code per the ‘Bitcoin block size debate,’ and simply write code to be used in Bitcoin.\nAlso Read: Why Bitcoin is Close to a Record Breaking 3 Exahashes of Processing Power\nYet various camps, which on the outside seem to be competing with one another, submit code to be used by Bitcoin’s open-source community. \nWhile it’s true there is more than one ‘team’ which submits Bitcoin development code, each with their own method, communication between the teams is mostly amicable, insiders tell Bitcoin.com. \n“Core of Core,” Allege Bitcoin Unlimited Developers\nCore snippet by Jonas Schnelli\n“But, there is a certain ‘Core of the Core’ that is very hostile towards those who are working on competing implementations of Bitcoin,” feels Dr. Peter Rizun, a Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) developer who holds a doctorate in physics.\nTo his point, a post recently appeared on Reddit: simply a photo of Wladimir Van der Laan, to whom bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen entrusted Bitcoin’s “Core” Github repository keys. The point of the post posited Mr. Van der Laan as Bitcoin’s “single point of failure,” and tied him to Blockstream, a private “blockchain” company that pays Bitcoin ‘Core’ developers.\nPowwow Where All the Core Devs Reach Consensus?\nThat threads’ most upvoted comment reads: “…He has made a lot of decisions. He is the man with the technical YES/NO buttons. He says yes or no to every single line of code in core to be published. Call him maintainer, gardener, the guy who gives water to roses, I don’t care. He has the responsibility of what is published from the core repository. It’s not a vote. It’s not a powwow where all the core devs reach consensus in a group orgasm. It’s a hierarchical system, and he is on top in the Github hierarchy. I think he is in the pocket of Blockstream AND under the elbow of [Blockstream co-founder] Gregory Maxwell. 120% Stockholm syndrome while drowning in fiat. Make the man responsible for the decision he makes with the power Gavin gave him.”\nUltimately, in the confusion surrounding Craig Steven Wright’s claims of being Satoshi Nakamoto, and Mr. Andresen’s confirmation thereof based on circumstantial evidence, Mr. Van der Laan locked Mr. Andresen out of Bitcoin Core’s Github, suggesting his accounts could be compromised. Core developers insist they aren’t shills for a private company.\n“There are a number of companies providing resources for Core development, not just Blockstream,” Bitcoin core developer Eric Lombrozo told Bitcoin.com. “For instance, Chain Code Labs, BitFury, BTCC, and my firm Ciphrex to name a few.”\nHe suggests the companies have simply found a way for Bitcoin developers to finally get paid for their work. In the past, former Bitcoin “Chief Scientist”, Mr. Andresen, was paid for a time by the Bitcoin Foundation.\nMr. Lombrozo adds: “All [Bitcoin development] is done completely in the open, everyone is welcome to join. There is no ulterior motive here other than building good software.”\nBitcoin Classic Code on Github\nWhat is ‘Core of the Core’?\n“I think there are basically two schools of thought,” says Dr. Rizun. “Theory 1: They were bought-off to change Bitcoin into something that could be controlled and slowed. Theory 2: They believe that Bitcoin is very fragile and they need to manage every aspect of it, otherwise it will break.” Dr. Rizun leans towards Theory 2. \nDevelopers allege a “change of tune” that the ‘core of Core’ had towards increasing the block size limit in recent years, censorship, alleged efforts by ‘core of core’ to shape the development narrative, as well as income from namely Blockstream. Dr. Rizun calls the latter a “conflict of interest.” \nImplementations\n‘Bitcoin-XT’ was the first code repository built to try to get Bitcoin development “back-on-track” to being the electronic peer-to-peer cash system Satoshi Nakamoto described in his white paper. QT, Classic, and Unlimited followed. BU developers represent themselves as a politically motivated group on their website. \n“In the Bitcoin Core variant, we do NOT see a venue for these actors to formally express their desires in regards to the evolution of the network,” reads the Bitcoin Unlimited website. “Instead we see a project controlled by a small group of developers employed by finance-oriented for-profit startup companies, and the emergence of corporate products (Lightning network, Side-chains and permissioned ledgers) that would materially benefit from a Bitcoin network that is incapable of handling the transactional demand required for a worldwide public good.”\nWhen the block size debate broke out in 2014, essentially one unified team split up, explains BU president Andrew Clifford. “Unfortunately, the modern ‘Core’ team ended up in control of the original Github repo.” \nAn enormous number of developers have been driven away from Bitcoin because of the ‘core’ of Core being a like-minded clique, contends Mr. Clifford. “Core people do not want any perceived threat to their reference client, even though this makes Bitcoin stronger through decentralized development,” he told Bitcoin.com\nMr. Lombrozo disagrees. “Practically none of the Bitcoin Core contributors are against other implementations,” he says. “Projects like btcd, bcoin, libbitcoin, BitcoinJ, et. cetera have never really been an issue. They don’t break the network consensus and, therefore, do not fork the ledger itself.”\nAccording to Mr. Lombrozo, alternative clients to Core, like Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin Unlimited, are not alternative implementations. “They are grabbing all their source code from Bitcoin Core, rebranding it, changing a rule that makes it incompatible and forks the network itself (including the ledger, not just the source code), then inciting hate against Core developers by, among other things, fabricating conspiracy theories,” in the Ciphrex founder and CEO’s view.\n\nOpen Source by Design\nThere has been a rotating cast of Bitcoin developers over the years. Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik have seen their roles evolve in the past near-decade since Bitcoin’s genesis block. Tom Zander, Tom Harding, and Dagur Valberg have long been active. New people are also “stepping up.” For instance, Peter Tschipper, Andrew Stone, Andrea Suisani are active now. Pre-block size debate they only made minor code contributions. Many more individuals contribute ideas and code to the project. \nThis is perfectly in line with Bitcoin’s organizing tenets. “Bitcoin Core is just a free open source software project, there’s no formal organization beyond that,” says Mr. Lombrozo. “We all contribute on our own initiative, and anyone is free to grab our stuff and do whatever they want with it. We’re not really trying to sell things in a marketing sense, but, rather, just proposing technical ideas.” \nAlternative client developers, who insist that in the scheme of things development between all teams is “amicable,” largely share similar feelings. \n“What we do is open-source and public,” Bitcoin Classic release manager Tom Zander tells Bitcoin.com. “If BU and Classic hide our technical discussions we can’t learn from each other. It won’t have any positive effect as all our work is open and available for all to see.”\nWhat do you think about the development process? Let us know in the comments below.

    "text": "\n Bitcoin wallets, including many mobile and all hardware wallets, are often backed up with a recovery seed word phrase which anyone can use to recover those wallets. Cryptoseed uses strong cryptography to turn your seed phrase into something no one else can use.\nAlso read: Review of the Cold Storage Hardware Wallet Cryptosteel \nThe Problem With Seed Word Phrases\nA recovery seed word phrase typically comprises 12 to 24 words right out of a dictionary. Keeping it offline in this format may be safe from hackers but not from people who come across it physically and know how to use it.\n“Writing down your BIP32 recovery seeds on plain paper might be solid electronic security, but terrible physical security,” explains Arlen Anderson, Cryptoseed developer on his project page. “Not everyone has a safe they can keep stuff like that in.”\nAbout Cryptoseed\nCryptoseed is an open-source desktop application for Windows and Linux, with OSX on the way. It is currently available for all to download and inspect the code on Github. Anderson explained:\n\nCryptoseed encrypts your recovery seed with AES256 and encodes the encrypted data into a QR Code which you can print out and keep anywhere.\n\nHow to Encrypt\nAfter a quick download and installation from Anderson’s Github page, opening the app will give you a simple black box asking you to input a seed and a password. Recovery is impossible without the password so be sure to choose something you will remember.\nAfter carefully typing in your seed and adding your password, clicking the ‘encrypt’ button will make your computer crunch the phrase for a moment. It will then give you an encrypted seed with a QR code to download for holding your seed in PNG format.\nEither the encrypted seed or the QR code file will recover your wallet, just as the original seed phrase does.\nRecovery Process\nRecovery is the same process in reverse, using either the encrypted seed or the QR code. After inputting the encrypted seed and password, clicking ‘decrypt’ will recreate the old seed word list. At press time, recovery from a QR code is not supported in the app so users will have to scan the QR code using a different app.\nOnce decrypted, the original seed word list is back and can be used just as before to recover your bitcoin wallet.\nHow Secure is Cryptoseed?\nUnless stored in a fireproof safe or using Cryptosteel, Cryptoseed will not protect your seed phrase from a fire. However, it does add a valuable layer of security against theft.\nBoth your password and recovery seed are “encrypted with the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of the Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key length,” according to Anderson.\nCryptoseed then generates the final seed with other randomness included and processes it all together one million times with SHA512 hashing. Due to all the randomness, “encrypting the same data with the same key will yield a different result every time,” he added.\nThe real danger is losing your password which, if lost, the seed would be lost forever. For added security, Anderson also suggested using Cryptoseed on an offline computer so no keyloggers nor other spyware can steal your seed.\nDo you think Cryptoseed is useful?

Berthaume was charged with illegally running unauthorized mining software on the Fed’s server from 2012 to 2014.\nThe Office of the Inspector General states that Berthaume plead guilty to unlawful conversion of government property. Initially, Berthaume denied knowing about the crime but later revealed his actions through testimony. According to court documents, Berthaume modified the network security as well, allowing remote access from his home.\n“This case demonstrates how my office will vigorously pursue Board employees who unlawfully abuse their positions and use government property for personal gain,” Fed Inspector General Mark Bialek explained.\nThe Admission of Guilt \nFederal Reserve Inspector General, Mark Bialek\nAfter originally denying any wrongdoing, Berthaume deleted the mining software to cover his tracks, the Inspector General detailed. However, from forensic analysis and members of the Federal Reserve System’s National Incident Response Team, the agents found evidence of Berthaume’s involvement. Bialek explained that the analyst was then terminated from the board and “ultimately led to his admission of guilt.”\nInvestigators could not determine how many bitcoins were accumulated by Berthaume’s actions. The Inspector General stated that the agency couldn’t conclusively figure out the profits “due to the anonymity of the Bitcoin network.” Furthermore, Bialek noted that the board’s data was now completely secure and the Board has subsequently implemented better security.  \n\nBerthaume’s actions did not result in a loss of Board information, and we have been informed that the Board has implemented security enhancements as a result of this incident. Additionally, Berthaume’s voluntary admission of guilt and his full cooperation were critical to the timely closure of this matter.\n\nThe story of the rogue Federal Reserve employee shows that there are clearly some members of the central bank who are more interested in cryptocurrencies than the private bank’s fiat money.\nWhat do you think about the Federal Reserve employee mining Bitcoin on the Fed’s server?

    "text": "\n People in economies suffering from market volatility are turning to Bitcoin applications to help them maintain their standard of living. Workers in Venezuela are using the popular Bitcoin marketplace Purse to save on basic necessities. As well, people in India are escaping the devaluation of their currency with payroll service Bitwage. In each case, Bitcoin seems to be making a difference, according to industry sources. \nAlso Read: The Who’s Who of the Bitcoinerati\nPurse Marketplace Helps People Save Money The top 20 countries using Purse.io.\nAlongside nations like Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, the world’s largest Bitcoin marketplace, Purse, has been adopted by individuals in countries stricken by economic hardship. Argentina, India, Venezuela, Brazil, Nigeria, Ukraine, Mexico, Philippines, Italy, and Croatia all rank among the top twenty nations using Purse for its considerable discounts. Each of these nations has experienced either geopolitical or financial turmoil in recent years.\n“People are currently using Purse in places like Brazil and Venezuela to buy food, beauty products, medicine, and other goods that they cannot purchase or obtain cheaply in their country,” says Steven Mckie, Purse Head of Growth and Product Content. “Countries like Venezuela can make it very difficult for citizens who are not wealthy or have connections to get the everyday essentials they need and maintain some modicum of normality in their day-to-day lives.” \nThese emerging market nations are comprised predominantly of Android users, who will now be able to use Purse’s Android app, released last week, to quickly earn and store bitcoins, and shop with their cell phone.\n“If you have a volatile currency like, say, the bolivar, and want to pay for a particular good, it’s best to hold your funds in bitcoin and get the discount on daily essentials through our platform,” Mr. Mckie says. “Furthermore, we can onramp more individuals in emerging markets by offering them a way of making money as a merchant and earning bitcoin.”\nThanks to the deployment of an iOS application in November 2016, and the Android app last week, Amazon’s North American marketplace is available to Purse users globally as the company continues to pursue a full-fledged ecommerce solution. Previously, users would have to use the Amazon marketplace associated with their country through the local currency, if Amazon was offered in their country at all. Not anymore.\nThe Purse marketplace.\nAlongside emerging markets, nations like Japan, Russia, France, Germany, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands appear on the list of Purse hotspots.\n“Now there are no borders from wherever Amazon users wish to shop, and as long as they’re using bitcoin, without going through local currencies, they will save money doing so,” Mr. Mckie explains.\nBitwage Helps People Earn Bitcoins\nPurse isn’t the only Bitcoin application helping people in emerging markets. “People living in countries with economic instability, such as Venezuela, Brazil and India, can actually make a lot more money if they are working for US, EU and UK companies,” says Bitwage CEO Jonathon Chester. “This is not just because companies in these countries pay higher wages. By leveraging the bitcoin blockchain as an underlying mechanism, you can receive rates much better than interbank rates.” This is demonstrated on Bitwage’s rates page. \nBitwage rates from US to Mexico compared with competitors.\nFor instance, Mr. Chester tells Bitcoin.com, a user in India would make over 20% more if they had received wages through Bitwage in India during the first two weeks of the country’s demonetization of certain notes.\nThis is why Bitwage is launching its new job board, BitWage.Me, which features a reputation system and seeks to connect people in places like the United States and Europe with workers in emerging markets. “So that we can empower local communities around the world to find good jobs and make more money when receiving their salaries,” the CEO says.\nSimilar trends are developing in other countries on the Bitwage platform. “Ukraine is growing, Mexico also happens to be interesting,” says Mr. Chester. “There are basically geographical price arbitrage opportunities in all of these places. Meaning that local demand for bitcoins is higher than global, which means price is higher locally.” Thus, individuals can buy bitcoin at normal prices and sell high in these countries.\n“This has led up to as much as a 25% premium on your wages during the first couple weeks of the India demonetization crisis that begun November 8th of last year,” Mr. Chester elaborates. “The main way to take advantage of these premiums is through wages/business disbursements, because, unlike traditional arbitrage opportunities, it is a lot harder to get the money out of the countries which they were sent into.”\nWhile not every country that is economically unstable has a big or growing bitcoin market currently, it is safe to say that once there is a group that is educated on the subject in the country, a market will develop, according to Mr. Chester. \n“As this is the case, it’s interesting to keep an eye on the economically unstable countries,” he says. “The main issue is getting bitcoin in these places, since no one wants the currency of an economically volatile nation, such as Venezuela or India. In order to get bitcoin into the country you either need to mine it there or get paid with bitcoin from overseas.”\nIf you live in an emerging economy, are Bitcoin applications helping you get by?

    "text": "\n As the biggest Chinese exchanges announce the implementation of transaction fees, Bitcoin, once again, shows off its inherent capacity to quickly adjust to the ever-changing environment, and to not only recover from adversity but to also get stronger.\nThe latest shock resulting from the imposition of transaction fees by Chinese exchanges caused bitcoin trading volumes to plunge dramatically on January 24, 2017. Now, as bitcoin’s value springs back, puncturing the USD 900 resistance level, trading migrates to non-fee-charging exchanges, and traders renew their optimism about the cryptocurrency.\nAlso Read: Japan Has Become a Big Player within the Bitcoin Economy\nChinese Exchanges Start Charging Transaction Fees\nHong Kong harbor\nBitvc, a bitcoin exchange registered in Hong Kong, joined Okcoin, Huobi, and BTCC in their decision to charge a 0.2 percent fixed trading fee starting on January 24, 2017.\nMost recently, on January 26, CHBTC announced its plans to start charging fees too. However, the rate of the trading fees remains undetermined.\n\nThe Chinese exchanges’ announcements of their decision to start charging transaction fees caused bitcoin trading volumes to decline spectacularly.\nIn this regard, Bloomberg reported, “trading volume has plunged 98 percent compared with the first days of 2017, according to data from bitcoinity.org.”\nCurbing Manipulation and Volatility in Bitcoin Trading\nBTCC\nEradicating these market flaws is precisely BTCC’s objective for charging fees. The BTCC announcement states, “To further curb market manipulation and extreme volatility, BTCChina will start charging fees for bitcoin and litecoin trading from 12:00 p.m. (noon) UTC+8 on Tuesday, January 24th.”\nIn effect, many Bitcoin enthusiasts see benefits resulting from the fees being charged by the Chinese exchanges. For example, Reddit user Blaireau1 believes that trading fees will let us see the true Chinese bitcoin market size.\nMoreover, according to Blaireau1, “while China still accounts for a fair share of all bitcoin transactions, the reduced share means that any actions now by the Chinese authorities to close off bitcoin will have a far lower impact than was previously thought. This surely reduces volatility and in the longer run will help Bitcoin achieve greater acceptance.”\nNow, the latest indicators show that trading is shifting to exchanges that do not charge transaction fees.\nMoreover, other exchanges in the region have been gaining prominence. For instance, as of January 28, 2017, Bitflyer, a Japanese exchange, ranks first in the ‘Bitcoin Exchanges Volume Ranking’, according to data from Coinhills.\n\nBitcoin, the Sturdy Currency\nOnce again Bitcoin’s resilience is being tested. The currency has had to confront a litany of obstacles during its nine years of existence, which include Mt Gox, the Silk Road, and other scandals.\nMoreover, let’s not forget that in 2013, China’s central bank banned financial institutions from performing transactions with bitcoins. This decision caused the cryptocurrency to crash over 20 percent to below $1,000 USD.\nNow, the charging of transactions fees by major Chinese exchanges is just the latest episode. The good news is that Bitcoin has always bounced back from any difficulties stronger and reinvigorated. Traders will diversify exchanges and re-adapt to the new ecosystem. Most importantly, the bitcoin market will become more transparent, more stable, less speculative, and better supported by more factual trading volume data.\nTraders like Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, remain optimistic. Lee said in his Lunar New Year message, “BTCC was successful in 2016. We are working hard to reach greater success in 2017.”\nDo you think Chinese exchanges charging trading fees will help us see the true size of the Chinese bitcoin trading market? Let us know what you think about these subjects in the comments below.\n_______________________________________________________________\nImagines courtesy of Shutterstock and BTCC.

    "text": "\n Cash and cryptocurrencies have been the target of the European Commission’s anti-money laundering efforts. Recently, the Commission published a roadmap of its proposal for the ‘restrictions on payments in cash’ initiative, extending them to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\nAlso read: Europe Committed to Tightening Digital Currency Rules by End of 2017 \nThe Roadmap\nThe roadmap or ‘Inception Impact Assessment’ aims to inform stakeholders such as law enforcement, tax authorities, central banks and everyone who would be impacted by the initiative and give them the opportunity to provide feedback. It explains the initiative and explores options to restrict cash payments.\nCiting cash transactions’ feature of anonymity, the roadmap states that “such anonymity can also be misused for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes”, adding that cash payment restrictions would potentially be a means to fight criminal activities using large cash transactions.\nSome options considered by the Commission include forcing payments through channels that are not anonymous such as bank transfers and checks using EU legislation.\nOn the other hand, a competent authority could be made responsible for ensuring transparency. Alternatively, the declaration can also be made independently by all parties to the payments. The Commission also considered the level of restriction threshold and whether there should be a single threshold or variable thresholds based on country’s purchasing powers.\nExtending the Restrictions to Cryptocurrencies\nAmong several approaches discussed in the roadmap is an option that takes into account new technologies such as cryptocurrencies.\nThe problem with cryptocurrency payments is different from that of cash. Cryptocurrencies are not regulated at the EU level. They are considered anonymous because their transactions are recorded but “there is no reporting mechanism equivalent to that found in the mainstream banking system to identify suspicious activity”, the Commission explained.\nThe roadmap suggests:\n\nAn option could be to extend the restrictions to cash payments to all payments ensuring anonymity (cryptocurrencies, payment in kinds, etc.). On the other hand, restrictions on cash payments could promote the development of alternative payments technologies compatible with the non-anonymity objective pursued.\n\nIf the cash restrictions were to be extended to cryptocurrencies, they will supplement the existing proposed measures to reduce cryptocurrency anonymity as outlined in the Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD) amendments proposed last July.\nMore EU Controls on Cryptocurrencies\nThe Commission has been actively working on ways to reduce cryptocurrency anonymity since it published the ‘Action Plan for fighting against terrorist financing’ last February. The Plan builds on the EU’s Fourth AMLD, due to be implemented this year. It states that “there is a risk that virtual currency transfers may be used by terrorist organisations to conceal transfers”, prompting the Commission to extend “the scope of the AMLD to include virtual currency exchange platforms.”\nIn July last year, the Commission proposed defining “all gatekeepers that control access to virtual currencies, in particular, exchange platforms and wallet providers” as entities that must monitor suspicious transactions with cryptocurrencies.\nEarlier this year, the Juncker administration confirmed that the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, which includes cryptocurrencies, is its priority.\nDo you think the EU will successfully restrict cash and cryptocurrency payments?

    "text": "\n From Silicon Valley to Wall Street the ‘blockchain’ concept is hyped, but it’s unclear if a reluctance to use bitcoin will be the downfall of distributed ledgers. The World Economic Forum once posited one-tenth of the world’s GDP could be “on blockchain” by 2025. The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance conjectures there are 70 blockchain firms out there. Yet, demos have yet to graduate from the lab and join Bitcoin in the real world. \nAlso Read: Bitcoin Gains One Million New Wallets Each Quarter\nReluctance to Use Bitcoin\n\n“About the only common element in the wave of initiatives has been a reluctance to use bitcoin,” details Lionel Laurent for Bloomberg. Meanwhile, blockchain pursuits by multinational corporations and financial institutions have garnered much criticism for being nothing more than “regulator-friendly shared databases.”\nIn the first half of 2014, as bitcoin consolidated and retraced the steps of its monumental 2013 all-time highs, R3CEV co-founders David Rutter and Todd McDonald were surveying the cryptocurrency space for startups in which to invest. By 2015 Mr. McDonald casually maintained the company’s blog, even mentioning MLB pitcher Bartolo Colon’s first major league home run which has been called “one of the great moments in the history of baseball.”\n\nIn its earliest internet mentions, R3CEV doesn’t mention blockchain. “We specialize in advising clients including global banks, interdealer brokers, exchanges, trading systems and more across the globe,” the company explains. R3 currently runs its subsidiary, Liquidity Edge, which offer US Treasury trading over a peer-to-peer market.\nAdditionally, the blockchain consortium sought to raise $200 million last summer. Sources claimed that a European bank was not happy about R3’s terms, and two other banks were also said to have concerns. Sources say banks dislike their lack of shares in the intellectual property developed by R3 lab, despite contributing resources for the experiments. Banks also reportedly held reservations over how much R3 wished to raise.\nRipple received $55 million in September from major banking partners. CEO Chris Larsen promptly left thereafter, citing a desire to spend more time with family. Ripple has noted to email subscribers it will highlight in 2017 its native digital token, XRP. The Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger, partnered with IBM, continues pursuing distributed ledger solutions and adding new members.\nBlockchain Challenges Beyond the Lab\n\nR3CEV founders say they prefer blockchain agnosticism. In other words, an in-production Bitcoin has no advantage over research-and-development distributed ledgers. ‘No, it’s not bitcoin!’” Mr. Rutter explained to Risk Magazine his thoughts on Bitcoin maximalism. “It’s an innovation inspired by the use of cryptographic maths, but it’s not about trust-less transfer of value – because of course guys, we all trust each other; our market has documentation and legal underpinnings, and we transfer billions of dollars to each other all the time.”\nIn a 2016 recap, the consortium cited numerous trials throughout the year as reasons for success. R3 executed transactions across a global private network in Microsoft Azure; tested blockchain technologies for fixed income trading; trialed invoice financing and letter of credit (LOC) transactions via smart contracts, as well as Ripple’s XRP in cross-border payments. The New York-based firm also developed a proof-of-concept for a KYC registry.\nBlockchain technology, however, might face challenges beyond the lab. Data from across the world shows increasing distrust of the very banks with whom R3 is partnered. The majority of UK’s small businesses ignore these bank’s advice. Millennials distrust banks as well. This could prove beneficial to Bitcoin adoption.\nSince it reached its most recent nadir of $197 in 2014, as Mr. Rutter and Mr. McDonald were formulating the modern-look R3CEV, Bitcoin’s price has steadily increased, peaking at more than $1,000 on New Year’s Day. On July 2, 2014, as R3 announced their vision for blockchain development, at the time there were 432 bitcoin transactions per block. On January 22, 2017 there were 1,703. Bitcoin’s hash rate has increased from 111,195 terahashes per second to more than 3 million. And today, according to Google Trends, ‘Bitcoin’ is a much more popular search term than ‘blockchain.’\nBitcoin’s fastest growing markets include Australia, China, Colombia, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, South Korea and Venezuela. Alongside this, two prominent Bitcoin believers have been associated with U.S. President Donald Trump. Investor Peter Thiel led Mr. Trump’s transition team on matters of science and technology. Bitcoin startup 21 Inc. CEO Balaji Srinivasan is currently being considered to lead the FDA.\nPerhaps, ignoring Bitcoin will come back to haunt “blockchain.”\nWhat do you think the growth of Bitcoin’s user base compared to big bank blockchain trials?

    "text": "\n The Central Bank in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) issued the ‘Regulatory Framework for Stored Values and Electronic Payment Systems’ on January 1 which appeared to ban all virtual currencies. However, the Bank’s Governor recently corrected this misconception, confirming that virtual currencies, including bitcoin, are not banned.\nAlso read: Dubai’s Role With Blockchain Technology’s Success Story \nBitcoin is not Banned\nThe UAE Central Bank defines ‘virtual currency’ as “any type of digital unit used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a form of stored value”. The recent Regulatory Framework states that virtual currencies are not recognized by these regulations, adding that:\n\nAll Virtual Currencies (and any transactions thereof) are prohibited.\n\nThis statement caused many people to conclude that the Central Bank has banned all virtual currencies. However, Gulf News recently obtained clarification from the Central Bank confirming that virtual currencies were not banned. Mubarak Rashid Khamis Al Mansouri, Governor of the Central Bank, told the publication:\n\nThese regulations do not cover “virtual currency” […] these regulations do not apply to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, currency exchanges, or underlying technology such as blockchain.\n\nThe Governor also revealed that virtual currencies are “under review by the Central Bank and new regulations will be issued as appropriate.” He emphasized that the Regulation Framework’s core objective is “to facilitate robust adoption of digital payments across the UAE”.\nA Closer Look at the Regulations\nThe Regulatory Framework is still unclear on what exactly is included.\n“Looking at the relevant wording and its location in the new Regulations (section D – Common Regulatory Requirements for all PSPs)”, Brian Meenagh, Partner at the Dubai-based Latham & Watkins law firm, explained to Bitcoin.com that “it appears that the intent of the wording is to prohibit payment service providers licensed under the new Regulations from dealing in virtual currencies at this point in time rather than prohibit virtual currencies throughout the UAE”.\nThese regulations would probably “give some comfort to businesses that treat bitcoin as a commodity that people can trade” such as exchanges, Meenagh said. However, “businesses that treat bitcoin as a currency that can be used for retail transactions or currency remittances should still proceed cautiously and seek further guidance as to whether or not they are affected (or prohibited) by the Regulations”, he added, citing the new regulations’ definition of payment service provider.\nOther UAE Bitcoin Regulations\nWhile some countries, such as Japan, consider Bitcoin as a method of payment, others, like the U.S., consider Bitcoin an asset. For the UAE, Meenagh believes that “until further guidance is issued, the new Regulations may lead to a pause in efforts to promote Bitcoin as a method of payment”.\nHowever, based on the Governor’s clarifications, “we would not expect the Regulations to change any behavior with respect to the operation and use of bitcoin exchanges in the UAE”, he clarified.\nNonetheless, virtual currencies are “being considered” by both the UAE Central Bank and the Dubai Supreme Legislation Committee, Meenagh pointed out.\nLast November, the Dubai Supreme Legislation Committee hosted a workshop on ‘the present and future of legislative and legal frameworks of Bitcoin’. Held amid a “high-level attendance of local and federal government entities,” the purpose of the talk was to help bring the UAE up to speed on the challenges that bitcoin and other digital currencies present.\n“The term ‘virtual currency’ is relatively new, not only in the UAE and the region but also globally. Therefore, there is an urgent need to spread awareness about ‘Bitcoin’”, said H.E. Ahmad bin Meshar Al Muhairi, Secretary General of The Supreme Legislation Committee in the Emirate of Dubai. H.E. He also noted that:\n\nWe look forward to support officials at government bodies nation-wide with detailed information about the optimal use of this virtual currency. This will acquaint them with the ways international law deals with ‘Bitcoin’, which is now officially recognised worldwide.\n\nHow do you think the UAE will treat Bitcoin?

    "text": "\n Switzerland is often thought of as a Bitcoin-friendly country. The Canton of Zug, for example, is sometimes called the crypto capital of the world and many Bitcoin service startups are located there, including Xapo, Shapeshift, Ethereum, Monetas, and Bitcoin Suisse. \nCompanies wanting to do business in Switzerland need an approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). So far, no Bitcoin company has been licensed by the Authority, but being licensed is not the only way to do business in the country.\nAlso read: Swiss Town Begins Accepting Bitcoin for Public Services \nFINMA License Not Needed\nVinzenz Mathys, a FINMA spokesperson told Bitcoin.com this week that “in the field of AML [anti-money laundering] regulation in Switzerland, service providers not subject to prudential supervision must either be affiliated to a self-regulatory organisation or be supervised directly by FINMA.” He also revealed that:\n\nFor the time being, no Bitcoin company holds a license of FINMA.\n\nFINMA has no specific provisions of digital currencies. “The use of bitcoins as a means of payment is not state-controlled”, its website states. Anyone paying in bitcoin or receiving payments in bitcoin needs no license.\nHowever, some Bitcoin-related activities are subject to Switzerland’s Anti-Money Laundering Act including buying and selling bitcoin on a commercial basis and operating trading platforms. These service providers “are obliged to find out whether they are in compliance with licensing requirements under financial market legislation”, FINMA states.\nTo be compliant, they have two options. The first is to be licensed by FINMA to operate as a ‘directly supervised financial intermediary (DSFI)’. There are currently 194 financial intermediaries holding FINMA licenses, but none is a Bitcoin company. The alternative is to become a member of a self-regulatory organization (SRO).\nWhat is an SRO?\nAn SRO is an organization that has met certain criteria set out by FINMA. Its members are financial intermediaries that are not licensed by FINMA. Among other duties, SROs are responsible for ensuring that their members comply with the requirements in accordance with the Swiss Anti-Money Laundering Act and imposing penalties on any member not in compliance.\nCurrently, FINMA recognizes 12 SROs in total, Mathys confirmed to Bitcoin.com. The largest SRO, the VQF, is the only one that is actually located in the Canton of Zug.\nSome Bitcoin companies are already members of the VQF SRO such as Bitcoin Suisse, BTC Express and Bity.\nMost Recent Approval: Xapo\nRecently, wallet provider Xapo has received a “conditional approval” by FINMA to operate in Switzerland after almost two years of much efforts and investment, according to founder and CEO Wences Casares. “This approval is contingent on several factors, including membership in a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO)”, Casares said.\nFINMA reportedly took a long time to understand Xapo’s business model in order to decide whether it should be considered a bank or a financial intermediary. If considered a bank, Xapo would have to obtain a banking license which is more complicated to qualify for. However, last week, FINMA concluded that Xapo does not need a full banking license, “because the safe-guarding of private keys wasn’t to be compared with conventional banking operations such as account keeping”, Xapo managing partner Olga Feldmeier told finews.ch.\nXapo, being in the Canton of Zug, is likely to join the local VQF SRO like other Zug-based Bitcoin companies have. Regarding becoming a member of an SRO, Casares said “we are optimistic that we will meet the required conditions and be able to serve non-U.S. customers from our headquarters in Switzerland”.\nIn addition, Casares commended FINMA for having invested considerable amount of time and resources in the approval process, adding that “many regulatory bodies in similar situations would have rejected Xapo (and Bitcoin) entirely”. Therefore, he believes that:\n\nFINMA has positioned Switzerland as a hub for fintech innovation and ensured Switzerland’s primacy in global financial services for decades to come.\n\nDo you think Switzerland will become the global Bitcoin hub?

So far Bitcoin has created a myriad of different markets, value correlations, mining data, and many more constellations of economic measurement.\nAlso Read: Japan Has Become a Big Player Within the Bitcoin Economy\nThis week Bitcoin.com gathered a bunch of different charts from our forum showcasing a visual view of everyone’s favorite cryptocurrency. Over the years, many individuals and organizations have measured certain aspects of the Bitcoin network using graphs and charts. Some of these representations show how Bitcoin has performed over a period of time, and where it stands today.\n\nBitcoin’s mining distribution has changed quite a bit since the early days. Over the past five years, it shows there are now more mining pools than ever. More recently, an assortment of smaller mining pools have entered the game.

The original announcement gave the market a hiccup price-wise, but volatility wasn’t as extreme as some news outlets suggested. Bitcoin was significantly more volatile when the PBOC made announcements concerning the cryptocurrency in 2013. The two charts above show recent data collected during the PBOC announcements in 2013 and 2017.\nDue to the latest PBOC inspections, exchanges in the country have changed their fee and margin lending policies.

    "text": "\n A new way of verifying blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain could make the digital currency more efficient. In the original version of Bitcoin, when nodes received a block of transactions, they would validate each transaction set. Most likely, these transactions were already validated before, when they were relayed across the network. \nHowever, this previous validation of the transaction was not used in block validation, causing an inefficiency in Bitcoin that limited the speed of block propagation. There have been many developer attempts to make this more efficient, including the forthcoming ‘Cuckoo Cache’.\nAlso Read: A Collection of Interesting and Recent Bitcoin Charts\nCuckoo For Caching Bitcoin\nJeremy Rubin\nIn May 2012, Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen added code to Bitcoin that caches results of signature verifications. “A node would check the cache to see if it was a properly validated signature”, explains Bitcoin coder Jeremy Rubin, who encourages developers of all levels to contact him (here’s his Twitter). “This would save nodes from the need to do an expensive ECDSA signature validation that they’ve already done before”.\nWhile examining Bitcoin’s codebase, Mr. Rubin noticed inefficiencies in how Bitcoin blocks were processed, rooted in the design of this Signature Cache. He began looking at the design with the idea of easing this tension in mind.\n“Imagine if every time you needed something, you had to go all the way home”, Mr. Rubin uses an analogy to describe Bitcoin’s original verification process. “It would be really tough to get through the day, especially around lunch time. But that’s why we carry backpacks. We can pack our lunch, pencils, books, and take them with us if we know we’ll need them later. We still have to go home sometimes if we need something we didn’t expect, but this happens infrequently”.\nIn programming, a ‘cache’ is a little bit like a backpack. “Bitcoin’s original signature cache was like trying to use a plastic bag with a tiny opening, half full of rocks, with holes in it as a backpack”, explicates Mr. Rubin, who worked on the code while contracting with Chaincode. “Due to the rocks, it was very heavy. Because of the holes, things would fall out all the time. Because it was a plastic bag, everything was disorganized and it took a while for you to find what you were looking for. Because of the tiny opening, you could only fit one hand in at a time and you can’t see what’s in your bag while you’re getting something or putting something in. But at the end of the day, having this bag is a lot better than having to go home so frequently”.\nCuckoo Cache, as Mr. Rubin analogizes, is like a backpack which has pockets and organizers, helping Bitcoin’s code knows where to look right away for the things it needs to verify transaction blocks.\n\n“The openings are large enough and you can see what’s there while you’re taking something out”, says the twentysomething, who once had to fend off a sweeping subpoena for Bitcoin coding activities. “It’s not filled with heavy rocks for no reason. You forget something at home on occasion, and you still lose something every now and again, but not as frequently as when using the bag with the holes”.\nMr. Rubin believes fine-tuning Bitcoin’s code via upgrades like Cuckoo Cache, which is integrated in the forthcoming Bitcoin Core Version 0.14, can go a long way towards improving network efficiencies. He suggests, moreover, that improved caching structures could improve other facets of Bitcoin’s codebase.\nMaking Bitcoin More Efficient\n“With Bitcoin, there are a lot of places in the codebase where we’ve used standard C++ data structures, because the standard library provides the simplest way to prototype many things, and these are capable of carrying the workload at first”, Mr. Rubin explained to Bitcoin.com. “But as Bitcoin scales, there are many big wins to be had if we reconsider the way we store and process Bitcoin’s data”.\nOptimizing these data structures, according to Mr. Rubin, is a particularly good place to get started with Bitcoin core development.\n“Data Structure optimization is a great place to start contributing to Bitcoin because the problems are pretty self-contained. You don’t need to understand all of Bitcoin to get started, and it’s somewhat easy to measure and communicate your results. Through working on these problems, however, you begin to gain a deep understanding of how Bitcoin works at a low level”.\nMr. Rubin encouraged developers interested to find such a project, but looking for guidance on how to get started or feedback on their work, to reach out to him via email.\nAre you cuckoo for Cuckoo Cache?

    "text": "\n In the past, some have called Litecoin the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold.” Now many Bitcoin proponents are eagerly watching Litecoin as miners have just begun signaling for Segregated Witness (Segwit). Bitcoin community members hope Litecoin’s Segwit implementation may show a silver lining beneath the ongoing scaling debate.\nAlso Read: How Trump’s Wall and Remittance Tax Could Give Bitcoin a Boost\nLitecoin Miners Begin to Signal Segwit Support\nOn February 3, the Litecoin mining community began to signal for Segwit integration. The upgrade claims to bring a few enhancements, fix malleability, and may even optimize block size capacity. This, in turn, could lead to more transactions processed per block and speed up the digital currency’s transaction queue. Furthermore, integrating Segwit will allow for the Lightning Network to be applied to the Litecoin protocol as well.\nCurrently, people can watch the altcoin’s miners signal for Segwit here to see if and when it reaches a threshold of 75 percent of total consensus. At the time of writing, 11.45 percent of the Litecoin network’s miners support the change. While visiting the Litecoin community’s subreddit, a good majority of people seem to be excited and support the Segwit integration. Moreover, Litecoin developers and the cryptocurrency’s creator Charlie Lee have also endorsed the soft fork.\nCurrent Litecoin and Segwit adoption statistics.\n      Charlie Lee Hopes to Break the Block Size Debate Deadlock\nCharlie Lee creator of Litecoin.\n“So you may wonder why I’m pushing for Segwit,” explains Charlie Lee in January. Litecoin does not have a block size problem. — But with Segwit and Bitcoin’s current block scaling deadlock, I see a potential for Litecoin to help Bitcoin break through this deadlock. Litecoin can take a lead and be a positive force in the cryptocurrency space. We have been drafting behind the Bitcoin race car for many years. It’s about time to take a turn out front.”\nLitecoin has been considered by many to be the strongest blockchain, second only to Bitcoin’s hashrate and security. The protocol which is nearly identical to Bitcoin was released into the wild via Github by Charlie Lee in October 2011. Since then, the network has gained a significantly sized hashrate which is 2,973 GH/s at press time. Lee believes the experiment of using Litecoin’s significantly sized network is an excellent testbed.   \n\nThis is my vision for how Litecoin and Bitcoin will work together to solve the world’s transaction needs in the future. And it is why the Silver to Bitcoin’s Gold analogy always resonated with me. Do you want to come along for the ride?\n\nCan Observing the Test Be the Silver Lining?\nIt’s safe to say that a good portion of the cryptocurrency community will be observing this test with Segwit and Litecoin. However, it may be a while before the Litecoin network of miners reaches 75 percent approval but if it does, Segwit will become part of the protocol. The threshold of 75 percent is lower than Bitcoin’s current 95 percent which is required for Bitcoin Segwit integration.\n\nFirst segwit-signaling block mined by Coinotron! https://t.co/yRelxuN109 https://t.co/JzfitvT49X\n— Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) February 3, 2017 Currently, Segwit support is hovering around the 23 percent range within the Bitcoin network. Meanwhile, smaller mining factions like BTCTop, GBminers, Viabtc, and more have been gaining more hashrate and supporting the alternative client Bitcoin Unlimited. While waiting for consensus, many Bitcoin users have been annoyed by the recent transaction backlog. On February 3, 896,000 BTC worth of transactions were stuck in the mempool and Bitcoin’s transaction queue was slammed for over 24 hours. Watching Litecoin deploy Segwit may bring hope for some but may not be fast enough in the eyes of others.  \nWhat do you think about Litecoin’s move to implement Segwit?

    "text": "\n Bitcoin is a freedom currency in a manner that isn’t obvious and which is virtually undiscussed. Bitcoin is commonly linked to victimless crime, but the dynamic reaches far deeper than merely freeing individuals to buy goods and services, unsavory or not. Victimless crime is the lifeblood of the surveillance state without which big government could not function. Victimless crime creates the surveillance state.\nAlso read: Surbitcoin On Hiatus Amid Venezuela Bitcoin Crackdown\nThe arch enemy of total scrutiny is the privacy and economic anonymity of cash or digital currencies. This means something as tiny as the pseudonymous transfer of one bitcoin is a threat to the state’s very existence.\nDaniel Krawisz of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute was nothing more than deadpan accurate in a 2014 presentation in which he stated, “Someone who promotes bitcoin who is not an anarchist is a crypto-anarchist because bitcoin is inherently anarchistic.”\nThe True Dynamic of Bitcoin and Victimless Crime\nA victimless crime is an illegal act that violates no rights and harms only the people who voluntarily commit it. And, then, the harm is only in some cases like drug use. And, then, only in the opinion of some people who are not necessarily involved. Politically speaking, victimless crimes are also the engine that drives the total surveillance state.\nWhy is this true? When a crime has flesh-and-blood victims, they almost always contact law enforcement because they want restitution, justice or protection. A mugged man files a police report on the chance of getting his wallet back; a raped woman views a police lineup in the hope of finding justice; a shop owner turns in the video of a theft so that a neighborhood thug won’t steal from him again. Law enforcement doesn’t need to ferret out such crimes. The police can sit in one place, have victims come to them and only then investigate. If the victims prefer to remain silent, then the police have little incentive to investigate a crime with no report.\nVictimless ‘crimes’ are the antithesis. The criminal acts are either consensual, like prostitution, or they are committed in isolation, like drug use. In either case, the police are neither contacted nor welcomed. No one turns himself in for buying a blow job; no one files a complaint on himself for snorting cocaine. These crimes do not come and knock on the police station door.\nTo enforce victimless laws, therefore, the authorities must hunt down the hidden scofflaws by monitoring the general population for suspicious behavior. They track the movement of money, create massive databases, eavesdrop on all communications, employ snitches and use a multitude of other intrusive tools of surveillance.\nThe incredible violation of privacy and personal rights is justified by the politically useful issues of illegal drugs, prostitution, and other moral hot buttons. Actual acts of violence such as child pornography and the funding of terrorism are thrown into the mix. The argument is this: because of a small number of hidden bad actors, everyone everywhere must relinquish their freedom and wealth to the state.\nIn more basic terms: the further law enforcement moves away from real victims and toward victimless crimes, the more it becomes a police state that relies on total surveillance. The state knows this. And, so, anything that blocks surveillance runs the risk of also becoming “a victimless crime.” For example, the refusal to fill out a census form is criminalized. Many people are puzzled by why the state penalizes such an innocuous act. They shouldn’t be.\nIn his book Seeing Like a State, James C. Scott commented, “If we imagine a state that has no reliable means of enumerating and locating its population, gauging its wealth, and mapping its land, resources, and settlements, we are imagining a state whose interventions in that society are necessarily crude.” Imagine a state that could not find your children to draft or your bank account to freeze. That state could not regulate your business or arrest you for peaceful but deviant practices. Acquiring data allowed the modern state to grow. The more data, the more powerful and effective its authority.\nIt is no coincidence that prison populations within America have risen by close to five times the level of 1980 when the war on drugs heated up. At this point, nearly 86% of federal prisoners are victimless criminals. The surveillance state has grown in pace. Appeals to compassion or common sense regarding prisoners have fallen on deaf ears because victimless crime laws serve their purpose: power and social control, which verge on being synonyms.\nVictimless Crimes\nThe term is no longer fashionable, perhaps because it highlights that people who commit no harm are being punished. The preferred term is now “crimes against society.” The shift in language casts society in the role of an individual who can be robbed, raped or assaulted and so must be protected by the state. This is why criminal proceedings list the state as the ‘plaintiff’ even when the real victim is known. The victimization of society occurs whenever an individual peacefully transfers his own money in an unapproved manner because 1) “who knows where that money came from or goes,” and 2) it is not taxed or otherwise skimmed by the state and banks.\nIn reality, of course, victimless crimes are not committed against society but against the state. They are a modern version of “crimes against the crown” – that is, a form of treason. The faux crimes are used to justify an ever-expanding surveillance system which forms the core of totalitarianism. They are so essential to state power that actual crimes, such as assault or theft, are often punished lightly compared to the ‘crimes’ of disloyalty to the state.\nThen, into the scene, bitcoin blunders like the proverbial bull in a china shop. Or so it must seem to central planners. To paraphrase John Lennon, “bitcoin is what happens when the state is making other plans.” The state’s response is a campaign of slander; bitcoin is child porn, money laundering, human trafficking…fill a despicable word into the blank. What is the best response?\nSolving Bitcoin’s Victimless Problem\nStop apologizing. There are people who use bitcoin to buy ‘immoral goods’ (whatever that means) just as there are people who use cash to do so. As long as the participants are consenting adults, that’s their business. Not yours, not mine. The state is the one who interjects violence and harm when it points a gun at peaceful adults. Stop apologizing.\nThe attack on bitcoin will be framed in moral terms. It will be cast as a way to protect vulnerable and misguided individuals who use their own bodies in ‘unacceptable’ ways. Or it will unfold as a campaign of resentment against those individuals who do not pay their so-called “fair share” toward maintaining the surveillance state.\nA moral attack must be met with moral indignation, not an apology. For one thing, an apology is an admission of guilt. The banner of bitcoin should read: “No victim. No crime. No apology.” If an individual is victimized by fraud or violence connected to bitcoin, then law enforcement should do their job and solve an actual crime.\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin’s role in victimless crimes?

    "text": "\n Bitcoin volatility has fallen since 2011 and compared to the U.S. dollar currently sits at about 3-4 times higher than the Japanese yen, British pound, and euro. High volatility in the digital currency space has long been cited as a reason against adoption. But, as charts and analysis demonstrate, it is very likely that Bitcoin volatility is trending downwards, even as volatility in other cryptocurrencies remain high. \nThe Bitcoin industry generally highlights key indicators like price, transaction volume, bitcoin wallet numbers and trading volumes to underscore Bitcoin’s increasing popularity. All of these factors have jumped in recent years. But Bitcoin’s volatility has fallen, now sitting at approximately 5%. For comparison, gold volatility averages approximately 1.2% and major fiat currencies between 0.5% and 1.0%.\nAlso Read: How Bitcoin Apps Help People Survive Emerging Market Volatility\nDiminishing Volatility\nBitcoin’s volatility, a measure of how much its price varies over time, has long been cited as the digital currency’s downfall. Each day, Bitcoin’s value goes up or down – and oftentimes both. Measuring volatility is important to judging an asset’s overall risk profile. High volatility is cited as to why sophisticated investors and the mainstream public stay away from Bitcoin. \nBitcoin analyst WooBull expects Bitcoin to match fiat currency volatility by summer 2019.\nInvestors generally limit exposure to volatile assets by not holding them or hedging. Hedging Bitcoin is tough due to a dearth of options to short Bitcoin. Further, the more volatile an asset, the more expensive it is to hedge. \nThere are external factors which could contribute to currency-pair volatility like fiscal policy, geopolitical disruption and other factors. Bitcoin volatility could also be a function of transaction volume, as some suggest.\nA paper published in 2014 by University of Victoria researchers examined the relationship between Bitcoin volatility and Google searches is implied. “Changes in Google Trends have an effect on the realized volatility of Bitcoin,” according to the paper. According to the paper, changes in the volatility of Bitcoin also have an effect on Google searches for Bitcoin.\n“An increase in Google Trends has a positive impact on volatility, and an increase in volatility has a positive impact on Google Trends,” states the research team, led by Darryl C. Davies. In the past year, this has proven untrue, as an increase in Bitcoin search queries has paralleled a decrease in volatility. \n\nAn end to zero fee futures trading in China has led some to speculate Bitcoin volatility will decrease in the coming months and years. When the change was announced, Bitcoin trading volume crashed 90%. In fact, most volatility so far in 2017 is credited to actions and statements by the Chinese government. Bitcoin.com reported earlier this year that monied investors in China are leaving their money in the digital currency.\n“We are starting to see a lot of smart money enter into the space and stay there,, ” said Ryan Rabaglia, Head Trader for Octagon Strategy, a Commodity and Digital Asset Trading firm based in Hong Kong. “In the form of small to medium sized institutions taking much larger positions in [bitcoin] and a natural progression to larger ones is sure to follow. With all the uncertainties surrounding us in traditional product spaces, alternatives are being sought, and although this space is still foreign to most, it’s not preventing the capital inflows we’re seeing.”\nAll Time Highs Amid Low in Volatility\nThe number of Bitcoin transactions has skyrocketed throughout the digital currency’s lifespan, as has the price, which currently sits near an all-time high after crossing the $1,000 threshold twice so far in 2017. The number of bitcoin wallets at popular multi-service provider Blockchain.info has increased, as well, in the past eight years. Trading volumes are also at all-time highs. Yet, over time, Bitcoin price volatility has declined. \n\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin volatility?

Dunworth explains that bitcoin may be worth more than gold soon and discusses some investors’ issues with the digital asset’s volatility. Host Rishaad Salamat asks Dunworth why the young entrepreneur believes bitcoin will be worth more than the shiny precious metal.\n“If you look at the principles of bitcoin, it’s actually already met parity with Gold in 2013 for one bitcoin per ounce of gold,” explains Michael Dunworth of Wyre. “But moving forward, bitcoin has what gold wishes it had. It has divisibility, still has scarcity like gold, but it’s also extremely transferable. If I wanted to get a brick of gold to you over there, Rishaad, it’s going to be pretty tough.

Furthermore, some investors believe that Donald Trump as POTUS may pave the way for a cryptocurrency-based ETF. However, even though Trump may ease regulatory policies across the country, it still may not happen. “Trump will ease the way, but that doesn’t mean it’s suddenly a sure thing,” details Phil Bak, former head of ETF listings at the New York Stock Exchange. Bak told Market Watch that regulators have a hard time dealing with innovation, stating:  \n\nMarket makers need to hedge, and the fact that you can’t short bitcoin means there could be liquidity issues that make it trade off its fair value, which is a problem from the SEC’s perspective.

On the “Davos Today” program, Smith tells the host that people are reexamining their relationship with the world and Bitcoin is a part of a shift. The shift has “created an opportunity for new technology,” explains the Blockchain founder. When asked if bitcoin could ever become legal tender, Smith believes most of the framework has already been established.\n“Most of the G7 has figured out how they’re going to tax bitcoin, as a commodity and as an asset,” details Blockchain CEO, Peter Smith. “I think it’s already a legal tender. There are millions of people using it on a weekly basis, but what I think what it is, it’s the first example of a truly digital asset. So what I think will happen over the next five years is we will see the creation of a lot of new digital assets. Some of these will be issued by governments themselves, others will be specific to companies, specific to loyalty programs, and specific to products like identity or governance. But I think it’s the first initial step in rewriting how a lot of this stuff works.”\nAs bitcoin breaks its latest price barrier into the US$955 range, it’s safe to say investors heard about Bitcoin from all angles this past week.\nWhat do you think about investors hearing about Bitcoin a lot more than usual?

Instead of staying in their home country, many Slovenians have sought greener pastures abroad in which to make an impact in financial technology.\n“Then there are the two of us – two hardcore libertarian, tech enthusiasts who dove into the world of Bitcoin, as well as many others,” Mr. Kodrič told Bitcoin.com. “Our company is quite known here for having achieved this small miracle of being a financial company out of Slovenia, and to have success globally in Slovenia.” He credits other Slovenian Bitcoin companies, as well, like Bitnik, Cashila and Iconomi, with turning Slovenia into a fintech center of the distributed sort.\nA little over 60% of Bitstamp clients are from Europe, and the exchange allows users to deposit money via the SEPA, thanks to Slovenia’s membership in the arrangement. Bitstamp, which this year added Ripple’s XRP trading to its platform and the option to pay with credit card for bitcoins in 57 nations, was originally founded as a European-focused alternative to the then dominant Mt. Gox.\n“We see adoption from the south, Baltic, and especially Scandinavian countries,” Mr. Kodrič told Bitcoin.com. “There is a correlation with linguistic knowledge of nordic countries, who speak more English than the southern countries, where in 2013 there was next to no articles in the native languages.”\nMr. Kodrič contends Bitstamp is known in the nation because Bitcoin is known. “To operate one of largest exchanges out of Slovenia, as Slovenians is something novel to Bitcoin,” he says. “Its users all start from same starting point in tech. Whether you’re Indian or in Silicon Valley, it doesn’t matter. Everyone has the same tools available regardless of where in the world they’re located. Because the tech is so decentralized, we had same chance to succeed as anyone else.”\nBitstamp, the nineteenth most searched query worldwide related to Bitcoin according to Google, is licensed for all European Union countries. It’s registered in Luxembourg for that country’s clearer regulatory framework than Slovenia, but this is steadily changing.\n\nSlovenia recently updated its main anti-money laundering law (AML). Cryptocurrencies are defined in the law, and all crypto exchanges and brokers are explicitly defined as financial institutions for AML purposes.\n“There are not many jurisdictions at the moment where cryptocurrencies are so well-defined by the regulator,” says Mr. Trcek. “Local meetups sometimes attract interesting attendees. From employees of main tax office to representatives of the central bank of Slovenia.” Such regulations lend legitimacy to people’s perceptions of Bitcoin, the Bitnik CEO suggests.\n“Pairing services like ours with banks and other financial institutions requires complex new procedures to be enforceable, not just recommended as before,” acknowledges Mr. Trcek. “We view stricter AML regulations as a good thing. Besides further legitimizing the business model it forces us to find novel solutions. Solutions that we might ‘export’ abroad once their regulation catches up.”\n\nAre you from Slovenia?

    "text": "\n Many governments around the world are preparing regulatory policies concerning cryptocurrency markets. The Philippines is now next in line to regulate Bitcoin operations as the central bank deputy governor, Nestor Espenilla, has revealed new virtual currency guidelines.\nAlso read: Mainstream Investors Are Hearing A lot About Bitcoin\nNew Virtual Currency Policies Coming to the Philippines\nPhilippine Central Bank Deputy Governor Nestor A. Espenilla\nBitcoin.com reported last June that the Philippines central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), was preparing new guidelines towards Bitcoin companies in the region. Now the BSP deputy governor, Nestor Espenilla, has published a circular (BSP Circular №944) that defines the government’s position concerning Bitcoin operations. In the document, the BSP states that it aims to regulate virtual currencies that apply to all payment systems and remittance platforms. Basically, it applies to any operation that may have “material impact on anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), consumer protection and financial stability,” explains the BSP.\nThe central bank will begin implementing the rules and regulations that govern operations of virtual currency exchanges in two weeks. The BSP circular notes that the new guidelines are not endorsements of bitcoin and other digital currencies. However, the Bank does recognize that virtual currency solutions have great potential. The deputy governor’s circular states:\n\nBangko Sentral recognizes that Virtual Currency (VC) systems have the potential to revolutionize delivery of financial services, particularly for payments and remittance, in view of their ability to provide faster and more economical transfer of funds, both domestic and international, and may further support financial inclusion.\n\nBitcoin Remittance Expert Weighs In \nBitcoin remittance expert Luis Buenaventura\nFollowing the recent BSP circular announcement, Bitcoin remittance expert Luis Buenaventura revealed his opinion of the central bank’s definitions and policies. Buenaventura has done extensive research on Bitcoin’s relationship with global remittances by studying strategies and startups in the crypto-remittance space like Bitspark and Abra. In his opinion, the latest guidelines in the Philippines define all virtual currency exchanges to be treated as remittance companies.\n“It certainly appears like the intention is to treat any business dealing with Bitcoin as a remittance agent, even if remittances aren’t the primary purpose of that company,” explains Buenaventura.\n\nThe new guidelines do not offer any concessions for order-book exchanges that have no international footprint, nor do they clarify the situation for sole proprietors buying and selling BTC on Localbitcoins. I’m unsure what kind of impact this will have on the Bitcoin startups operating within our borders, but I hope that it won’t put the brakes on the innovative momentum that has been building up over the past few years.\n\nThe Central Bank is Learning About Bitcoin, But Definitions Are Too Broad \nThe Bitcoin industry within the Philippines will have to wait and see how these policies take effect in the country. Buenaventura says bitcoin exchanges and remittance startups have made a lot of progress since 2013, but still have a long way to go. Furthermore, he’s encouraged that the BSP spent a lot of time learning about Bitcoin, but the central bank has “vastly overestimated how much of it is actually used for remittances.”\n“From one angle, it’s good news that the government is finally recognizing that we exist and acknowledge that our efforts do have a positive social impact on our country,” Buenaventura adds.\nWhat do you think about the Philippine central bank regulating Bitcoin?

    "text": "\n One could assume there is a certain nostalgia towards your very first bitcoin. Perhaps someone has a memory tied to a specific transaction. Certain bitcoins can be tethered to memorable acts, have associations with people, have a unique transaction time-frame or block height, among many other attributes that can give cryptocurrency numismatic value.\nAlso read: On Decentralization and Network Societies: An Interview With David Orban\nBitcoin Nostalgia \nEarlier this week I emptied a Bitcoin wallet on my phone because the application was having issues with dynamic fees. As I was sending the digital currency to my cold storage device, I realized these bitcoins were dear to me. One bitcoin is based on the value others will pay for the digital asset. Yet with certain associations tied to the currency, it raises the question — can some bitcoins be worth more than others?\nBitcoin has been known over the course of eight years to hold numismatic value. Numismatics is the study and collection of currencies. This includes coins, cowry shells, paper money, and many types of currency used over time, including Bitcoin. A numismatist is a person that collects currencies that have different meanings, associations, and histories. Both physical bitcoins and even its digital version can hold the characteristics of numismatic value.\n\nPaying Extra for Bitcoin Associated with the 10,000 BTC Pizza Transaction \nEven as far back as 2011, it was noted on the Bitcointalk.org forum that someone was willing to pay 1.5 BTC for one Bitcoin that was associated with the original 2010 pizza transaction. The post in the summer of 2011 led to a discussion of whether or not certain Bitcoins can be worth more than others. One community member explained his opinion of the subject stating:  \n\nJust like physical coins and bills have numismatic value, bitcoins from certain blocks could have numismatic value as well.  This could be due to the block’s low number, or because the block is special — such as block 140,000 from a few days ago, which contained the last of the first 1/3rd of all bitcoins to be issued.\n\nIn the Eyes of the Beholder \nA Casascius physical Bitcoin.\nPhysical Bitcoins can also hold collectible value, and probably more so than the digital form. For instance, Casascius physical bitcoins from 2011-2013 are extremely valuable. There have been instances of a single series-one Casascius selling for well over the coin’s face value. The art of collecting coinage has existed since ancient times, and this pastime has continued with physical bitcoin collecting.\nAs the years go by, it is quite possible that older transactions or coins with tethered memories could sell for more than Bitcoin’s current spot price. Unless some sort of significant fungibility concept comes into play within the network, Bitcoin’s traceability will increase numismatic value. Moreover, an individual could also add some metadata to the Bitcoin creating another form of a colored digital currency collectible. Last year the Smithsonian opened a new exhibition at its National Numismatic Collection which included Bitcoin.\nNational Numismatic Collection, Smithsonian Bitcoin Section.\nSome of the first bitcoins I’ve ever owned were held on my mobile phone, and no additional transactions were ever added to the wallet. These Bitcoins may be important to me but most likely never will be worth more than the spot price to others.\nDo you think certain bitcoin can hold numismatic value?

Just recently, two legislators from Hawaii sponsored House Bill 1481, which aims to begin the research of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The bill states that the legislature has recognized “vast potential for this technology to drastically change and improve public sector operations and private industry capabilities.”    \nThe Hawaiian representatives are planning to create a digital currency and blockchain working group. The think tank will establish a group consisting of both the public and private sector “to examine, educate, and promote best practices for enabling blockchain technology to benefit local industries, residents, and the State of Hawaii.” The legislators believe the group can best assess practices regarding blockchain technology.\n‘Bitcoin has Broad Benefits for Hawaii’\nAlongside building the Hawaiian “Blockchain Technology and Digital Currency Working Group, ” the politicians see potential with Bitcoin and tourism. The state’s tourism relationship with Asia shows that Bitcoin use in the region is growing.\n“Digital currencies such as Bitcoin have broad benefits for Hawaii,” explains House Bill 1481.  “A large portion of Hawaii’s tourism market comes from Asia where the use of Bitcoin as a virtual currency is expanding. Hawaii has the unique opportunity to explore the use of blockchain technology to make it easier for visitors to consume local goods and services and to drive the tourism economy.”\nState representatives believe digital currencies and blockchain can enhance cyber security, retail, transportation, supply chain management, and “emerging industries including marijuana.” Cryptocurrencies and blockchain frameworks are a “novel peer to peer networking and distributed data storage technology that shifts the primary locus of control from centralized services to individuals or key holders,” details the proposed bill.\nHawaii Joins the Many States Preparing Bitcoin and Blockchain Legislation With a Friendly Approach\nTwo other states have joined Hawaii by publicly revealing digital currency and blockchain legislation. North Dakota’s Senate has established Bill 2100 which aims to regulate Bitcoin. Moreover, Arizona’s House Bill 2417 wants to establish legal blockchain-based smart contracts in the court system. As for Hawaii’s digital currency and blockchain bill, it shows the representatives who drafted it are paying close attention to this technology. \nThe island state legislature appears to be taking a more friendly approach to Bitcoin in comparison with other U.S. states.\nWhat do you think about Hawaii’s Bill concerning Bitcoin for tourism and the potential of blockchain technology?

Previously, they were not exempt from VAT, and some claim Bitcoin adoption in the country has been stifled due to the high tax rate.\nAlso read: High Tax Slows Bitcoin Development In Norway \nBitcoin Trade Subject to VAT\nIn November 2013, the Norwegian Tax Administration issued a statement that bitcoins will be treated as capital property, not a currency, for tax-related purposes.

    "text": "\n Due to its unprecedented growth, the economic importance of the solar energy industry is surpassing that of the fuel energy industry. The solar industry’s exponential growth has boosted solar jobs by 25 percent since 2015, the Solar Foundation reported. Concurrently, Bitcoin and the Internet of Things are becoming an even more integral element of the solar energy industry.\nAlso read: Dutch Hackathon Looks at Blockchain Energy Solutions\nSolar Energy’s Massive Growth\nThe fall of installation costs is one of the main factors driving the solar energy boom. One key indicator of this extraordinary growth is the number of jobs the solar industry is creating.\nAccording to the Solar Foundation, “The Solar Jobs Census 2016 found that solar employment increased by over 51,000 workers, a 25 percent increase over 2015. Overall, the Solar Jobs Census found there were 260,077 solar workers in 2016.”\nThe report estimates that the industry will continue to sustain its growth, predicting that total solar employment will increase by 10 percent to 286,335 solar workers, in the next 12 months. Now, in the US, the solar energy industry has created one of every fifty new jobs. As a result, the number of solar energy industry jobs is twice as great as the number of coal jobs.\nAnother key indicator is the number of photovoltaic installations, which are breaking historic records in the US, particularly during Q3 2016, as shown in the chart below.\n\nThe solar energy industry growth is indeed dramatic. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that “4,143 megawatts (MW) of solar PV were installed in the U.S. in the third quarter of the year, a rate of one MW every 32 minutes. That pace is even faster today, as the fourth quarter will surpass this past quarter’s historic total.”\nBitcoin, a Partner of the Solar Energy Industry\nBitcoin and the solar energy industry are increasingly intertwined. For instance, buying solar panels with bitcoins is becoming easier. Several businesses, such as gogreensolar.com, AM Solar, and Spendabit, offer complete solar panel kits and accept bitcoin as payment.\nAdditionally, many experts believe Bitcoin technology can help solve fundamental problems related to the energy industry, in particular distribution and trading.\nLaurent Schmitt, Smart Grid Strategy Leader for GE’s Grid Solutions, says, “The problem of ‘too much’ renewable energy on a grid can be solved with blockchain, a technology most often associated with Bitcoin. Blockchain will provide a transparent way for households and businesses to trade renewables with each other.”\nIn this regard, an Australian startup, Power Ledger, announced on December 1, 2016, the launching of Australia’s first “blockchain-powered” residential electricity trading market. This market facilitates the sale of surplus renewable energy produced at residential and commercial developments connected to existing electricity distribution networks, or within microgrids.\n“Power Ledger puts the power to manage the energy economy into the hands of consumers while maintaining the value of existing distribution networks,” claims the Power Ledger’s website.\nIoT and Bitcoin Bolster Better Energy Systems\nNew York borough of Brooklyn, NY\nThanks to the combined power of the Internet of Things, Bitcoin technology, and community power storage, innovative microgrid concepts are becoming a reality.\n“Community storage, distributed generation, electric vehicle fleets, and coordinated load management can all be enabled by IoT, machine learning, and blockchains. We are exploring how this will make for a more efficient and clean energy system,” affirms IDEO Colab’s website.\nSpecifically, the blockchain-based Transactive Grid provides real-time metering of local energy production and usage and other relevant data, allowing users to trade energy on this platform openly. This project, which started in a Brooklyn neighborhood, in New York, has now attracted the interest of tech giant Siemens.\nAccording to an LO3 Energy and Siemens joint press release: “The microgrid planned for Brooklyn, which started as a pilot project of LO3 Energy, is now being further developed with the aid of Siemens Digital Grid in the US. For the first time, a microgrid control solution from Siemens is being combined with the peer-to-peer trading platform from LO3 Energy known as Transactive Grid.”\nBitcoin technology, the IoT, and other Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies will continue fueling the growth of the solar power industry with increasing momentum, facilitating the creation of amazing solutions to generate, distribute, and trade solar and other renewable energy sources.\nWhat are your thoughts on using Bitcoin as the main currency for the renewable energy market?

    "text": "\n Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Vice President, Dr. David Andolfatto, is optimistic about Bitcoin, as an alternative currency could impose limitations on the ability of governments to raise revenue through money creation.\n“In some countries”, the former professor says, “the ability for a central bank to print money is a significant source of revenue for the government. It’s not the case in the U.S. or developed countries. But in underdeveloped countries, where you don’t have a well-developed tax system, and still a relatively large fraction of the population living in the countryside, an alternative to collecting taxes is through the inflation tax. That is, to print money”.\nAlso Read: How Bitcoin Apps Help People Survive Emerging Market Volatility\nDr. David Andolfatto, St. Louis Federal Reserve Vice President\nDr. Andolfatto, who posts his thoughts on the Macromania blog, doesn’t take a qualitative position on the inflation tax. “If a government does it to build a hospital for sick children, it’s arguably a good thing,” he points out. “If it does it for military hardware for evil friends, it’s probably bad. Either way, if a government finds itself fiscally constrained, it’s going to want to start printing money at a faster and faster rate. 10 percent in the first year, then 20 percent a year, 30 percent, and so on. At those rates, it becomes costly to hold cash because it’s losing its purchasing power very rapidly”.\nIn such circumstances, people tend to seek out money substitutes or alternative currencies like gold, the US dollar or bitcoin. Recent examples include places like Zimbabwe and Venezuela.\n“What people do in high inflationary and hyperinflationary circumstances is seek alternative or competing currencies,” Dr. Andolfatto tells Bitcoin.com. “This could be the U.S. dollar, gold and things like that. Governments and central banks often then impose currency restrictions, maybe by implementing laws keeping people from opening USD denominated bank accounts.”\nIt’s not so easy, however, for a money printing central bank to stymie capital inflows into digital currency.\n“Enter Bitcoin, where any kid with a phone and access to the internet can now access this alternative cryptocurrency not under jurisdiction of any government, because it’s accessible through the internet,” the Vice President explains. “The only way a government could really crack down on it is through draconian measures, essentially shutting down the internet in the country or confiscating everyone’s personal devices.”\nAlso Read: Federal Reserve Report Favors Private Ledgers to Open Blockchains\nProvided a government doesn’t go so far, Dr. Andolfatto believes Bitcoin could promote central bank moderation in fiscally strained countries.\n“You can see how this competing currency might impose some sort of discipline on a central bank in the future if Bitcoin becomes more popular, and is more widely used in, say, a country like Venezuela,” he says. “This potentially precludes the ability of a central bank and government to over-inflate the currency.”\nThis alternative currency could have implications for central bank policies in other jurisdictions in the developing world, according to Dr. Andolfatto, whose interests are in banking, money and payment systems.\n“You’ve always seen competing currencies emerge, the only difference is this one is digital and through the internet,” he notes. “To the extent that Bitcoin is available, to the extent bitcoin has zero inflation, people are going to be asking themselves, ‘Why should I accept this bolivar for my labor and goods when the bolivar is depreciating at a quick rate? Why don’t I just accept bitcoin with my phone and payment address?’ In that matter, the population substitutes out the domestic currency, the bolivar in this case, and starts to ignore it. It becomes valueless or is driven out of circulation and the economy switches to bitcoin or some other substitute.”\n\nSo, if no one wants the bolivar, Venezuela’s ability to extract an inflation tax then goes to zero. “[A government’s] ability to acquire goods and services by printing money depends on people accepting money,” Dr. Andolfatto elucidates. “If no one accepts bolivars, only bitcoins, then the central bank and government are going to be out of luck”.\nHe adds: “If central bank and government understand the threat of this currency substitution, they are not likely to increase inflation rate. They will keep the inflation rate lower than it otherwise would have been, and will be able to extract less inflation tax revenue because people could dump the bolivar and substitute with bitcoin”.\nDr. Andolfatto, notably, doesn’t believe Bitcoin represents an entirely new phenomenon altogether.\n“Central banks have been under threat of currency competition since the beginning of [central banking history],” he tells Bitcoin.com. “Currency competition is arguably a good thing. It’s been a good thing. There is nothing to prevent anyone from paying someone in pesos here in the U.S. The same is true for bitcoin. And bitcoin is a de facto foreign currency as far as central banks are concerned.”\nWhy do you use bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below.

Can you explain what this entails?\nMŠ: Until last year, the Czech Republic didn’t have any specific laws concerning Bitcoin. However, from January 1st, there is a new regulation which enforces AML/KYC procedures for virtual currency exchanges. Every customer has to be identified.\nBC: Recently some reports claimed the Ministry of Finance had visited and fined Paralelní Polis. Is this true and if so what happened?\nMŠ: Recently, Paralelní Polis has opposed a new Czech financial regulation, EET, which enforced real-time reporting of every business cash transaction to the Ministry of Finance. Paralelní Polis has refused to abide by this law by publicly denouncing it. Two weeks ago, our cafe ‘Bitcoin Coffee’ was visited by two financial officers checking on EET compliance. According to them, they found out that Bitcoin Coffee doesn’t adhere to the EET law. We are awaiting the official response.\nBC: If Paralelní Polis was asked to abide by cryptocurrency KYC rules and regulations, would the organization follow these rules?\nMŠ: No. The founding ideas of decentralization and personal privacy would force us to refuse it and to make a public case against it. \n\nThis is another part our mission of decentralization: to expose the immorality of the state system, and openly refusing to cooperate while creating a parallel one.\n\nBC: Why did you get involved with Paralelní Polis?\nMŠ: In 2014, I started to work for Satoshilabs, the creator of Trezor. People from Satoshilabs told me about the planned Paralelní Polis in October 2014. I visited the opening and the first Hackers Congress, and I was immediately captured by its interdisciplinary, communal and anti-system feeling. Shortly after, I became a voluntary organizer of weekly Bitcoin meetups which are now a core piece of the Institute of Cryptonanarchy program. In early 2016, I moved to Paralelní Polis full-time as the project coordinator and organizer of HCPP.\nCrypto-anarchism (or cryptoanarchy) is a cyber-spatial realization of anarchism.\nBC: Do you think the concepts of decentralization and the foundations of cryptoanarchy scare Czech bureaucrats?\nMŠ: Firstly, they don’t grasp the concept of it all. It is something invisible, which is currently in the making. Currently, they are trying to get their heads around Bitcoin and create laws and regulation to be able to treat it. But, I don’t think they are scared. Bitcoin is too small, and its implications are hard to see for most people.\nBC: Last year, members of the art collective Ztohoven cut the Czech Republic flag and attached Bitcoin to the flag’s pieces. Can you tell our readers about this event?\nMŠ: Ztohoven is the original founder of Paralelní Polis. In August 2015, they captured the president’s flag from the roof of the Prague castle and replaced it with their big red underpants. The project was called “President’s Dirty Laundry.” It exposed our current president as a man “who is ashamed of nothing at all” and the role of president in today’s society in general. The flag was believed to be lost for a year. In June 2016, Ztohoven announced the “Decentralization of Power“ project in which they cut the captured flag into more than 1000 pieces and connected them with bitcoin private keys, thus creating paper wallets. These wallets were loaded with various amounts of bitcoin and randomly distributed among people of the Czech Republic. This act symbolically decentralized the political power and created an opportunity to publicly discuss its meaning.\nBC: Do you think in the long run the nation-states will ultimately fail being faced with counter-economic tools like Bitcoin and other decentralized technologies?\nMŠ: Yes. I think the nation states will be restructured under the forces of decentralization and they won’t play the same role as they do today. \n\nI see it as an evolutionary process, somewhat similar to what happened to medieval cities. They became more open, their defense walls were deconstructed, and they are not viewed as power centers anymore. People are not thinking of themselves as the members of this or that city anymore.\n\nBC: How did the recent hackers conference at Paralelní Polis go?\nMŠ: This was our third Congress, and the best in my opinion, with the most attendance and public impact. Its topic was decentralization. We had more than 40 speakers from around the world, including Andreas Antonopoulos, Paul Rosenberg and Timothy C. May. We are currently rolling out one talk each Friday on our youtube channel.\nWe have already announced the date of HCPP17 which will happen the first weekend in October. Its topic will be the need for financial freedom put in contrast to the current global tendencies of tightening regulations, banning of cash and financial de-anonymization.\nBC: What’s the overall goal of the Paralelní Polis Cryptoanarchy Institute?\nMŠ: The overall goal of the Institute of Cryptoanarchy is to create an educational platform for the open discussion of important techno-social topics, such as decentralization, online privacy, and personal freedom in a world where technologies are becoming increasingly powerful in both good and bad senses. \nThis year we are going to focus on the communication of our topics with the public in a clear and understandable language. We hope to accelerate public discussion and growth of the community around Paralelní Polis. What do you think about the hacker house, Paralelní Polis? Let us know in the comments below.

    "text": "\n The Hong Kong-based Whaleclub is a bitcoin trading platform that has amassed over 15,000 traders since it started in January of 2016. The trading engine is offered in over 190 countries worldwide and just recently surpassed US$1 billion worth of trades on the platform.\nAlso read: Reusable ‘Payment Codes’ for Privacy: Coming to a Wallet Near You?\nWhaleclub Sees Significant Growth \nWhaleclub started last year by creating a trading platform that allows the trading of foreign currency, stocks, and more using bitcoin as a payment vehicle. The company states that by utilizing a digital currency to power the trading it allows for significantly lower costs than fiat currency does.\nThe trading platform – led by CEO Perry Steegen and COO Petar Zivkovski – has seen significant growth over the past year. Furthermore, the company added a broad array of new features last month. Whaleclub now boasts over 15,000 traders and believes it is because of its sophisticated trading technology, low spreads, and fast execution throughout the system.\n\nBitcoin.com spoke with Whaleclub’s Petar Zivkovski. He told us the company’s unwavering focus on customer satisfaction propelled the trading platform this year.\n“We get emails every day from customers who say they love the platform and that they’ve recommended it to friends,” Zivkovski told Bitcoin.com. “I think this kind of word-of-mouth can only be achieved when the product truly resonates with people. Customer satisfaction is our north star, so we’re incredibly grateful when we get feedback like this from the community. We don’t spend much on marketing, beyond announcing updates and milestones to the community. We focus on listening to customers and making a product people love – and I think that’s helped fuel Whaleclub’s growth.” \nOur goal is to make it incredibly easy for anyone to start trading, and bitcoin helps us achieve that. Fiat systems are sluggish and just a pain to deal with. Bitcoin enables a global, low-cost, fast, and private trading experience, and that’s what people get when they use Whaleclub.\n\nOver $1 Billion Traded\nUsing the Whaleclub platform is pretty straightforward as users simply deposit bitcoin and choose a market they would like to trade in. For instance, customers can decide to trade crude oil shares, stocks like Apple or Amazon, precious metals, and national currencies. The platform runs 24-7, but some markets like stocks are closed for the weekends.\n\nThe interface has technical charts, and users can also opt to submit long and short positions on the platform. There are many options to choose from such as turbo trading, and a mobile trading application, as well. Whaleclub’s Petar Zivkovski believes the benefits of Bitcoin has primed the company’s success:\n\nCrossing $1B in total trading volume is indeed an incredible milestone for the company, especially given the fact that we’ve been around for just over a year. It’s a testament to the utility and usefulness of bitcoin too – Whaleclub runs entirely on Bitcoin and is a textbook use case for the digital currency.\n\nMr. Zivkovski concluded: “It’s also a testament to the great opportunity that lies ahead. Whaleclub never touches dollars, fiat, or banks because we think those belong to the past. Our mission is to build a future powered by digital currency and I think we’re just getting started.”\nHave you ever tried the Whaleclub trading platform? Let us know in the comments below.

    "text": "\n Japan has recently overtaken the US and China as the highest-volume country for bitcoin trading in the world. In April, the first Japanese bill with provisions for digital currencies including bitcoin will enter into force. It will recognize bitcoin as a method of payment, but at the same time, it will impose regulations on bitcoin exchange service providers.\nAlso read: Countdown: Bitcoin Will Be a Legal Method of Payment in Japan in Two Months \nWhat the Bill Means for Bitcoin Exchanges\nJapan’s Payment Services Act and the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds were amended on May 25, 2016, to impose certain regulations on digital currency exchange service providers, including bitcoin exchanges. The drafts of proposed amendments were announced by the Financial Services Agency of Japan (FSA) last December and are expected to take effect in April.\nAny entity wanting to provide a digital currency exchange service must be registered with the Prime Minister. The amendments lay out numerous other requirements such as having a minimum capital of 10 million yen, deploying sufficient IT system defenses against theft and loss, and providing certain information to users such as their trading address, registration number and fee schedule.\nAnother part of the new regulations requires exchanges to establish several systems and processes, including employee training, internal rules, governance, and guidance for outsourcing. In addition, they must also regularly undergo an audit by a public certified accountant or audit firm at least once a year and submit periodic activity and annual reports.\nFrom the Perspectives of Bitcoin Exchanges\nThe bill aims to protect consumers with “reasonable restrictions,” Yuzo Kano, CEO of Bitflyer, told Bitcoin.com. “Even foreign entities who provide services to Japanese residents will be regulated under the law”, he said.\nBitflyer is the largest exchange by volume today, according to Coinhills. The exchange has raised a total of $35.6 million in funding up to date, including the recent investment of 200 million yen from investors such as Mizuho Capital. Other shareholders include large Japanese corporations such as SBI Investment, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mitsui Financial Group, Densu Digital Holdings, and GMO.\nKano noted that:\n\nWe lost trust on bitcoin three years ago and the majority of people still don’t believe in it in Japan. This is the time to recover the trust so large corporations will enter the market with various business use cases. This will eventually bring a wider range of attentions and make a bigger bitcoin-blockchain ecosystem.\n\nKagayaki Kawabata, Business Development Lead at Coincheck, another major Japanese exchange, told Bitcoin.com that “overall the new bill itself is a progressive bill that will position Japan as the leading Bitcoin country.” However, given that there are so many requirements, he feels that “the law will be a huge barrier to entry for underfunded early stage cryptocurrency startups”, adding that “from our standpoint, as a cryptocurrency startup started by a single programmer, it’s pretty sad that the new regulation may wipe the potential of startups like us”.\nCoincheck has been experiencing substantial growth recently, with US$130 million in monthly transactions, and new signups at a rate of 1,000 every day. Its merchant processor service is also growing quickly, swelling from 1,000 to 5,000 merchants over the last year. Overall Kawabata believes that:\n\nWhile there are some negative aspects to the regulation, government acknowledging Bitcoin is huge progress. When we look at the development of Bitcoin in the long term, we think the positives overcome the negatives lifting Bitcoin to the next stage.\n\nUpdating KYC Process\nKawabata explained that “there are various requirements we need to comply with to continue our exchange business,” he said. “As an operating exchange, KYC/AML and paperwork are probably the heaviest part. We need to comply with strict KYC requirements similar to banks which cause new users’ KYC process to be somewhat complex”.\nFor Bitflyer, Kano also admitted that “we will need to change the KYC process to fit the new rule.” In anticipation of this bill, he noted that “we have already been audited and have prepared necessary internal organization changes.”\nDo you agree with the two exchanges that this bill will help take bitcoin adoption in Japan to the next level?

    "text": "\n Over the past few months, politicians and regulators have sought to grasp the concept of Bitcoin and its underlying technology, blockchain. This past week, U.S. representatives Jared Polis (D-Colo.) and David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) revealed the launch of a bipartisan Congressional Blockchain Caucus.\nAlso read: Bitcoin-Powered Whaleclub Crosses $1B in Total Trading Volume\nA Congressional Blockchain Caucus\nColorado Democrat Jared Polis initiates Congressional Blockchain Caucus\nAcross the U.S., bureaucrats and states are trying to understand virtual currencies and distributed ledger technology. On February 9, government representatives created a Congressional Blockchain Caucus that aims to help policymakers create sound regulatory policies surrounding these technologies.\n“Lawmakers need to understand that as the world rapidly changes, it’s our responsibility to ensure that we craft policies and adapt laws that match our ingenuity,” Democrat Jared Polis explained. Polis believes these emerging technologies can “transform the 21st-century economy” by reshaping finance, supply chains, cybersecurity and more.\n“I look forward to the Caucus’s upcoming policy briefings and meetings that will educate members of Congress on these innovative technologies,” detailed the Colorado representative.\nDigital Currency, Blockchain Advocacy Groups Join In\nWith the newly created bipartisan effort, two well-known digital currency and blockchain advocacy groups, Coin Center and the Chamber of Digital Commerce, say they will also help the blockchain caucus. Coin Center’s Jerry Brito said his organization was pleased to see a caucus dedicated to understanding blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Brito hopes that when regulations are developed in the future, they don’t stifle these nascent technologies.\n“Its development could also be hampered by outmoded regulation,” explains Coin Center’s Jerry Brito. “We applaud Reps. Polis and Schweikert for having the foresight to create a forum for members of Congress to learn about the technology and champion its responsible development, and we’re honored to have helped them in launching this effort.”\nOn February 15, Coin Center said they had taught Congress the difference between Bitcoin and blockchain at the first congressional briefing. Coin Center’s director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh explained to lawmakers the contrasts between public blockchains like Bitcoin and private digital ledgers. \n“As we’ve stressed before, understanding this distinction is essential to understanding the critical role that open networks will play in the future of internet infrastructure and business innovation,” Van Valkenburgh stated.\nFirst Congressional Blockchain Caucus briefing. Coin Center’s Peter Van Valkenburgh teaches lawmakers the difference between public and private blockchains. Image via the Coin Center blog.\nMixed Reactions from the Crypto-Community\nThe announcement of the newly created Congressional Blockchain Caucus had mixed reactions across forums within the Bitcoin community. A number of people applauded the congressional organization focused on studying cryptocurrencies and blockchain. \nOne Bitcoin community member writes: “Jared Polis is a hardcore bitcoiner, let him do his thing from the inside.” \nOther opinions within the community were skeptical, believing no good could come out of government interference with these technologies. A vast amount of forum comments concerning the new blockchain caucus resembled this one from the announcement posted to Reddit.  \n\nI don’t see this as good news at all. The ONLY reason that the government would EVER get involved is because they want their cut and to prevent us, the citizens, from using it in any way to become independent and free from their oppression.\n\nWhat do you think about the creation of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus?

    "text": "\n A Committee of the European Parliament has recently proposed amendments to a regulation including online purchases using digital currencies such as bitcoin. Calling for customer data from such transactions to be stored in the EU, the goal is to protect consumers, it says.\nAlso read: Europe Lays Out Roadmap to Restrict Payments in Cash and Cryptocurrencies\nThe Purpose of the Regulation\nThe proposal was written by the European Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE). The 38-page report was published last week with amendments to a regulation by the European Parliament and the Council. ITRE is responsible for technology-intensive manufacturing, information technology, and telecommunications.\nThe regulation to be amended addresses “geo-blocking and other forms of discrimination based on customers’ nationality, place of residence or place of establishment”. The stated aim of the regulation is to ensure that customers and traders are not discriminated against.\nStoring Personal Data at Centers in the EU\nIn the section of the report concerning digital currencies, the Committee urges the European Commission to consider a legal framework to protect consumers “when the transaction is carried through alternative modes of payment, including virtual currencies, other blockchain type transactions and e-wallets”. Specifically, the Committee proposed:\n\nThe personal data created by the e-commerce transactions should be stored in data centres in the Union, regardless of the location that the seat of the payment company is incorporated.\n\nThere is only one exception to the Committee’s proposal, which is for data controllers to get certified under the new EU data protection rules. Adopted last April, these rules referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679).\nThe new data protection rules enter into force on May 25, 2018. They apply to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents. “This innovation will particularly affect non-European Internet service providers”, wrote Michele Papa of Martini Manna law firm about the regulation.\nWhile the new rules are supposed to provide for a harmonization of data protection regulations throughout the EU, they are costly and have strict penalties. Infringements of the Regulation’s provisions are subject to administrative fines up to €20,000,000.\nEU’s Other Proposed Restrictions on Digital Currencies\nJean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission\nThe EU has been active lately proposing regulations that apply to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nThe Commission introduced an action plan last February for fighting terrorist financing, which includes a provision on reducing anonymity associated with digital currencies. In July, it proposed making exchange platforms and wallet providers monitor suspicious digital currency transactions. Last month, the Juncker administration said fighting against money laundering and terrorist financing, which includes cryptocurrencies, is among its priorities. Two weeks later, the Commission laid out a roadmap to restrict payments in cash and digital currencies. This latest proposal adds to the list of EU’s attempt to reign them in.\nWhat do you think of this new EU proposal? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "text": "\n Concerns about government-sponsored hackings, digital warfare, and an increasing number of malicious cyber attacks prompted tech giant Microsoft to call on governments for a Digital Geneva Convention.\nPresently, members of the Bitcoin community fear persecution in some countries. For example, Bitcoin miners and traders are being arrested in Venezuela. Therefore, the proposed Digital Geneva Convention should incorporate articles or protocols also to protect members of the Bitcoin community, as well as the free development of the cryptocurrency.\nAlso read: Venezuelan Authorities are ‘Weakening’ Bitcoin Mining Operations\nMicrosoft President Wants a Digital Geneva Convention\nBrad Smith, Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer\nBrad Smith, President, Microsoft, manages Microsoft’s external legal affairs, and he called for a Digital Geneva Convention, at the RSA Conference, San Francisco, CA, on February 14, 2017.\nSmith has been a key player in leading Microsoft’s efforts on privacy and security.\nAs reported by Reuters, “Microsoft President Brad Smith on Tuesday pressed the world’s governments to form an international body to protect against nation-state hacking, saying recent high-profile attacks showed a need for global norms on police government activity in cyberspace.”\nSmith confirmed his appeal for a Digital Geneva Convention via Twitter declaring:\n“Needed: a Digital Geneva Convention to protect civilians on the internet, as the 1949 Geneva Conv. protects civilians in times of war.”\n\nGeneva Conventions Protect the Vulnerable\nGeneva Convention 1864\nSmith in his appeal refers to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which added articles for the protection of civilians. This Convention was introduced in 1949.\nThe purpose of Geneva Conventions is to protect vulnerable and defenseless individuals, during armed conflicts. According to Cornell University Law School:\n“The Geneva Conventions is a body of Public International Law, also known as the Humanitarian Law of Armed Conflicts, whose purpose is to provide minimum protections, standards of humane treatment, and fundamental guarantees of respect to individuals who become victims of armed conflicts.”\nDenmark to Nominate its First Digital Ambassador\nSetting up the Digital Geneva Convention and then having the states ratify it will undoubtedly entail a substantial diplomatic effort.\nIncidentally, Denmark is planning to appoint its first Digital Ambassador.\nDanish Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen has declared that given that Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and other technology giant corporations have reached importance and power of such magnitude that “they merit their own ambassador,” Politiken reported.\nIf the Denmark’s digital ambassador becomes a reality, his or her job will certainly be to encourage technology corporations to increase investments in Denmark, as well as contribute to the advancement towards building a cashless society.\nAlso, supporting Smith’s call for a Digital Geneva Convention might be a pertinent responsibility of the Digital Ambassador.\nDigital Geneva Convention Should Include Articles Protecting Bitcoin\nBitcoin miners Adan Erick Tapia Salas and Edwald Antonio Tapia Salas.\nBitcoin is a technology-driven, borderless world currency. Bitcoin’s blockchain technology open-source code makes all transactions transparent, immutable and irrevocable. Changes in the blockchain cannot occur without being exposed.\nBitcoin and its blockchain technology are decentralized, permissionless and trustless networks.\nAll these features allow Bitcoin to be censorship resistant and resilient, capable of overcoming tremendous challenges, as demonstrated during its short existence.\nNevertheless, members of the Bitcoin community are being persecuted and arrested. Specifically, the government of Venezuela has been shutting down significant mining operations as well as arresting Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin traders.\nTherefore, the call for a Digital Geneva Convention is consistent with the need to ensure the protection of the cryptocurrency from malicious cyber attacks and the Bitcoin community from oppressive governments, thus allowing the currency to strive and flourish in freedom.\nDo you think the proposed Digital Geneva Convention should incorporate protocols to protect Bitcoin and Bitcoin community members?

    "title": " A peer-to-peer, bitcoin-only freelance marketplace called Rein has launched a beta version, bringing it one step closer to completion.",
    "text": "\n A peer-to-peer, bitcoin-only freelance marketplace called Rein has launched a beta version, bringing it one step closer to completion. The service could create a strong, uncensorable market for Bitcoiners to offer their skills online and earn a living in bitcoin.\nAlso read: Openbazaar Integrates Tor – The Platform’s Most Requested Feature \nLike Openbazaar, Rein has been designed as a decentralized software program that offers user ratings, a multisignature escrow solution, and TOR routing, while taking no fees from its users. Instead of selling products, however, Rein users sell services that were designed to be not censorable. The platform must be installed by both the freelancers and the clients offering jobs. Once they have done so, it works a lot like other popular freelance job boards such as Upwork, Peopleperhour, Toptal, and Simplyhired.\n\nLatest Version Release\nThe new Rein version 0.3.0 beta was launched last week for Linux users. The instructions on how to install the program are, however, not newbie friendly. “The software has been through the command-line only stage”, developer David Sterry told Bitcoin.com, adding that it is now “seeing the first push with a GUI”, referring to the program’s new graphical interface. In addition, he said:\n\nI can say the software works because I’ve been using it and, from my perspective, it’s ready for a large number of people to use.\n\nOnce installed, users will find that there are already some active listings with a few jobs completed. “Previously there have only been a handful of users, mostly centered around testing, and building Rein itself”, Sterry said. “A couple of programming jobs for Bitcoin software, a few for Rein itself, and some marketing gigs”.\nThe jobs board offers many of the usual features found at a freelance jobs website, such as making a profile, posting jobs, browsing jobs, making bids, and accepting delivery, all with a built-in multisignature escrow system.\nAs proof that the marketplace itself works, he noted that “Rein is, in fact, being used to accelerate building itself,” in his latest announcement. “All of the work for newest developments were done by working individually with 2 devs and 5 translators paid collectively 1.2 BTC.”\nFull Escrow and Anonymity On Every Job\nThe escrow works much like Openbazaar’s escrow, where moderators (called mediators in Rein) can become involved after a dispute arises. A set of 2-of-3 multisignature keys is always generated with every contract. Once both parties have chosen a mediator during a dispute, the mediator then gets the third multisignature key. Mediators charge their own pre-determined fee, typically around 1%, according to Sterry. He also noted that:\n\nTwo-of-three signature release on funds, with independent mediators, guaranteeing that you’re working with actual people, rather than a corporate dispute management protocol.\n\nThe open source project also has a full TOR integration, allowing Freelancers, Clients, and Mediators all to use the site anonymously. Sterry has been working since late 2015 on the project and has kept the focus on decentralization and anonymity. There are no contractual obligations to the site or Sterry in any way. “Unlike many other platforms, we don’t impose any legal limits or requirements on our users,” he explained.\nDecentralized… Soon\nSince the project is still in development, Sterry admitted that Rein isn’t yet fully decentralized, and is currently operating “using a couple of servers” at the core for now. However, he explained that “The software is designed to make use of any number of servers and anyone can run their own server to add to the decentralization of the network”. In addition, he pointed out that:\n\nAt some point in the future it may not be necessary for servers to be run at all but at the beginning stages, this model works well. People need not stay online or keep their client running for their jobs to move forward.\n\nHowever, the current lack of decentralization creates an opportunity for anyone who wants to run their own server to earn some coin. Sterry explained that “The software also includes basic payment processing so if anyone is interested to run a server they can charge for it”.\nThe Road to Adoption\nIn the new beta version, there are only a handful of jobs listed, but Sterry is confident that this will soon change. “My impression is that for the few people I’ve engaged, the income they earned working on Rein was significant for their own monthly budgets”, he detailed, adding that he doesn’t “think it’ll be long, probably this year,” when a full version is ready. By that time, most people already using bitcoins can install Rein and start earning a living.\nSterry realizes, however, that the rest of the world will be dragging behind in adoption because they aren’t already a part of the Bitcoin economy. He believes that “For those who have bitcoin and have never hired anyone to do anything, Rein is a great way to get started leveraging their coins to accomplish their goals whatever they may be.” He further noted that:\n\nIf we’re talking about mass adoption, that’ll take time and probably some technology advances along the way…just like Bitcoin.\n\nFuture Plans\n“We are working on a mobile app that should see its first release next quarter,” Sterry revealed. “Rather than native desktop apps, it’s more likely that we’ll make a Chrome extension or a client-side encrypted web application similar to Blockchain.info’s wallet.”\nUntil then, the developer realizes that there is a long road ahead getting the word out. “The key challenge is showing potential clients the benefits of using bitcoin to pay for online work in the way Rein makes possible,” he described. However, he believes that if he can show them these benefits, the value proposition of a decentralized marketplace for labor that takes no fees will help market itself. He noted:\n\nIt really unlocks a global workforce and takes out of a lot of the friction around payments and fraud so there’s tremendous value.\n\nWhat do you think of Rein?

    "title": " Bitcoin’s block size debate may be getting a new option called Lumino. The proposed Bitcoin scaling solution will supposedly",
    "text": "\n Bitcoin’s block size debate may be getting a new option called Lumino. The proposed Bitcoin scaling solution will supposedly offer an upgrade to 100 Transactions Per Second (tps) without raising the block size or risking a hard fork.\nAlso read: Following a Day of Delays, Lukejr Proposes to Decrease the Block Size \nWhat is Lumino?\nLumino takes a whole new approach to scaling Bitcoin, according to RSK’s (Rootstock’s) co-founder and Chief Scientist Sergio Demián Lerner, who is in charge of the project. In early January, during bitcoin’s steep rise to the year-to-date high, while all eyes were on the price charts, Lerner unveiled the project for the first time, tweeting that “I’m working on a new approach to scalability on PoW-based blockchains. Allows 5K tps over home PCs. Very exciting! Soon I’ll publish!”\nAt that time, he considered the yet-unnamed project just a sidechain for Bitcoin on the RSK platform. “Can this be used for #Bitcoin?”, a Twitter user asked him. Lerner replied: “As a sidechain, yes. As a hard-fork or soft-fork, it would require a lot of work. Our plan at @RSKsmart is a Bitcoin sidechain”. Lerner told Mooti CEO Bradley Chun: “It’s something truly different, looks like hub-and-spoke net, but in the background something different happens”.\nOver the last month, the Rootstock Chief Scientist has been leaking hints about Lumino from his twitter feed, and early this week, he tweeted:\nSince Lerner’s announcement, many people have asked him for access to the white paper. However, he did not publicly respond to those requests and has been quiet about who the reviewers are.\n100 Transactions Per Second\nEarlier this month, Lerner tweeted that 100 tps was demonstrated at blockchain developer conference Construct, which ran the last two days of January in San Francisco. In his tweet, he wrote:\n\nWhile people argue about 2 MB hardfork, we demoed live in Construct how @RSKsmart sidechain allows 100 tps. Quietly, we’re changing history.\n\nAt Bitcoin’s current 3 to 7 tps, Lumino’s proposed 100 tps represents approximately 33 to 14 times more transactions in each block than Bitcoin currently allows, and 6 to 14 times more than it could have after a hard fork to two-megabyte blocks.\nTo accomplish this feat, Lerner explained that he has found a way to store all the information of a transaction inside a tiny amount of space, cramming that many transactions inside a single megabyte block. He also confirmed that Lumino does not require Segwit. Earlier this week, he tweeted:\n\nI achieve 8 bytes per transaction under certain (uncommon) usage patterns. That’s only 64 bits.\n\n64 bits of data is far smaller than each transaction is in a current block, which has somewhere between 18 bytes and several hundreds of bytes per transaction, depending on the number of input and output addresses that the transaction has. So even with the smallest transaction possible, the amount of space it would take up inside a block could be reduced significantly using Lumino.\n‘The Best Way to Scale to 20K TPS’\nOn Saturday, Lerner’s latest hint addressed the long-term scaling solution by offering the possibility of scaling up to 20,000 tps with Lumino. He tweeted:\n\nHe also mentioned in another tweet that “Lumino is better as a sidechain of Bitcoin (@RSKSmart) to get 10 seconds confirmations, but could be also a Bitcoin soft-fork”.\nWhat do you think of Lumino?

    "text": "\n Since early 2015, Dubai has focused on taking blockchain technology mainstream. On March 6, 2017, the World Blockchain Forum returns to the opulent Burj Al Arab in Dubai so participants can learn and capitalize on these innovative technologies first hand.\nBlockchain Accelerates in Dubai\nCryptocurrency solutions like Bitcoin and underlying blockchain protocols are growing quite popular in Dubai. The country’s Crown Prince has pledged to have all government documents held on a blockchain protocol by 2020, and is also investing one billion dirhams ($275 million USD) into Dubai’s fintech and blockchain sectors.\nIn order to bolster Dubai’s technological lead and research, World Blockchain Forum attendees will experience a day filled with crypto-industry luminaries and leaders in distributed ledger technology.\nWorld Blockchain Forum participants will hear from bright minds such as Osman Sultan, CEO of Du; Wesam Lootah, CEO of Dubai Smart Government Establishment; Ali Sajwani, CIO at EmiratesNBD; Eva Kaili, European Parliament Member; Dr. Noah Raford, COO at Dubai Future Foundation; and Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain.com.\nThe event will provide a networking space for attendees and blockchain industry leaders to build relationships. Attendees include the Director Generals, CEOs, CIOs, and COOs of the largest organizations in the Middle East and Europe, including Smart Dubai, DFF, Dubai Holdings, Emirates Airlines, DIFC, IBM, Microsoft, Visa, Deutsche Bank, EmiratesNBD, Bank of Canada, Danske Bank, Aramco, DMCC, and more. The focus of this year’s event is the implementation and piloting of blockchain projects, rather than the initial exploratory stages.\nThe World Blockchain Forum 2016 Dubai\n‘…Massive Shift within the World’s Tech Landscape’\nThe World Blockchain Forum producer Moe Levin told Bitcoin.com he looks forward to this year’s Dubai conference, stating:\n\nDubai is at the intersection of Asia, Africa, and Europe and significant global financial traffic runs through it. Through Dubai’s incredible leadership, I think that blockchain technology has been prioritised as a major opportunity and we are seeing the effects of this prioritisation around the entire UAE.\n\nWorld Blockchain Forum producer Moe Levin at the 2016 event in Dubai.\nLevin added: “As the industry has grown around the world, Dubai has not taken a backseat in the evolution and production of new use cases and piloting them. Smart Dubai and the Dubai Future Foundation have both announced that they will have all government documents on the Blockchain by 2020. Customs and Immigration are piloting blockchain projects and Dubai Police are piloting new projects. There is not one government agency in Dubai that is not embracing the massive opportunity that innovation brings.”\nThe World Blockchain Forum is dedicated to catering to both blockchain novices and experts. Attendees from all around the world are set to attend the World Blockchain Forum alongside Dubai’s local government representatives, financial institutions, and academia, as well. \nTickets to the World Blockchain Forum can be purchased at keynote.ae. Keynote organizers want Dubai participants to “get [in on] the ground floor and position themselves to capitalise on this massive shift within the world’s financial landscape.”\nClearly, blockchain technology is on its way to being a disruptive force in our global society. And, Dubai definitely wants its role in blockchain technology to be a ‘success story.’ \n\nWill you be attending the World Blockchain Forum in Dubai?

And, we have exchange partnerships with Unocoin (India), Coinsecure(India), Coins.ph (Philippines), Airbitz, and Bitso (Latin America/Mexico) as well”, Purse Head of Growth and Product Content, Steven Mckie, told Bitcoin.com.\nAccording to the company’s latest data, the U.S. tops the list with 40 percent user base, followed by India, Venezuela, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Japan. The company hopes that the partnership with Bity will increase the number of users in Europe.\nBity is a Swiss cryptocurrency broker which serves the majority of users in Switzerland, France, and Germany but operates throughout Europe. The exchange accepts both EUR and CHF. “By partnering, Purse can increase the number of on-ramps for individuals looking to purchase bitcoin in order to spend them on our unique service”, according to Purse’s announcement.\nCross Promotions, New Users for Purse and Bity\nAll of Purse’s partners, including Bity, “each promote our e-commerce services either via in-wallet promotion to direct users to our service as an affiliate, or we use a GeoIP filtering modal that directs new users to our various partners as the go-to exchange to buy bitcoin in their particular region”, Mckie described. He added that:\n\nBity is currently promoting our site through their platform, and we will be directing our users from various geo locations to their service to quickly get started to buy bitcoin. The more on-ramps to buy bitcoin, the more new users Purse can capture.\n\nCross promotion has already begun. An ad that says “Save 15% Off Amazon with Bitcoin. Purse.io and Bity.com together can help you save money on all your online purchases from Amazon” can be seen on the Bity account log in page.\nAlexis Roussel, Bity’s co-founder, shared with Bitcoin.com: “The whole Bity team are regular users of Purse. We were already recommending it and using it as a very good example of bitcoin usage. Partnering with Purse was definitely a no-brainer for us”.\nOther Expansions Planned\n“Currently, we see our largest growth in Venezuela, Brazil, Philippines, and India,” Mckie said, adding that the company has more partnerships in the pipeline to expand into a few more key markets including more exchanges.\nMore interest is found in “areas with economic uncertainty/currency volatility where bitcoin is the best hedge to protect wealth”, he further noted. Furthermore, he said: “Most of the users in emerging markets see Purse more as a utility than just a normal e-commerce site, and depend on our site as a means to live normally”.\nWhat do you think of Purse’s partnership with Bity?

    "text": "\n A possible ban on bitcoin for marijuana purchases in Washington State has failed, according to a source close to the matter, who wished to remain anonymous. SB 5264, the much-discussed ban on virtual currency for marijuana, failed to make it out of committee. Further, a Senator that brought the bill forward, most likely Senator Ann Rivers, has withdrawn her support of the bill after a hearing in the Washington State Senate highlighted Bitcoin’s positives, not its potential negatives.\nThe bill to ban virtual currency use in the cannabis industry was brought forth by the founders of Payqwick, which some refer to as the “Paypal of Pot”. \nIt didn’t take long for their concerns to be downplayed by multi-state agencies and a company specializing in bitcoin payments for the marijuana industry.\nRelated: A Cannabis Industry Icon Accepts Bitcoin\nNo Virtual Currency Ban\nJames Paribello, legislative liaison for the Liquor and Cannabis Board.\nFounders of Bitcoin point-of-sale service Posabit, as well as a lawyer from Perkins Coie, spoke against a virtual currency ban for cannabis businesses.\n“We just follow the Department of Financial Institutions lead on this issue,” said James Paribello, legislative liaison for the Liquor and Cannabis Board. “They have licensed businesses, [and] there are businesses licensed by us operating in this space and accepting and transacting through [bitcoin].” LCB had no concerns over Posabit.\n“We rely on the [Division of Financial Institutions] to make the call as to who can play in this space and since the DFI has said it’s okay, we’re okay,” said Mr. Paribello. The Senators, who had certain prejudices about Bitcoin, asked numerous questions about digital currency in general.\n “When I read about Bitcoin on the international space, it’s talked about with international drug transactions, the black economy, a way to get around currency controls, a way government can track things and anonymity,” said Senator Michael Baumgartner, who came away from the hearing intrigued about Bitcoin’s ability to limit the amount of marijuana cash being transported by armored car in his state. \nPerkins Coie lawyer Joseph Cutler argued: “Before we regulate currency [we] might want to understand how it works. What are the benefits? What does it do? It is a transparent, auditable transaction ledger. Every transaction done today is posted to that public ledger. This idea that it’s untraceable is simply false. People say Bitcoin is anonymous, that’s also false. We call Bitcoin pseudonymous, which is better than cash. In marijuana, cash is king, and there’s no traceability of customers for cash spent in marijuana stores. In virtual currency, that is not the case.”\nCash is dangerous, suggested Posabit founder Ryan Hammond. “It’s dangerous to hold, dangerous to move, and you become a target of potential crimes.” \nPosabit Chief Compliance Officer, John Baugher, echoed this concern:  “If law enforcement has questions about a certain transaction, and if they paid in cash, there is no way to answer this question.”\nThe failed Washington State bill to ban bitcoin for pot received widespread press coverage before the hearing.\nWhat do you think about the merging of cannabis and Bitcoin?

This includes household names like Travis Kalanick, Peter Thiel, and 21.co-CEO Balaji Srinivasan as a potential FDA director nominee, and now Mick Mulvaney as the director of the U.S. Office of Budget. The senate approved Mulvaney in a tight vote which resulted in a 51-to-49 vote in favor of Mulvaney being appointed as the new budget director.\n“With Mick at the head of OMB, my administration is going to make smart choices about America’s budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayer’s trust in how their money is spent,” explained Trump during Mulvaney’s nomination.\nMulvaney’s Relationship With Bitcoin and Blockchain \nSouth Carolina Republican Mick Mulvaney is a bitcoin fan.\nMulvaney has participated in government committees concerning virtual currency regulation alongside helping Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) and David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) with the launch of the bipartisan Congressional Blockchain Caucus. Additionally, Mulvaney has solicited bitcoin donations for his campaigns. \nAccording to a speech obtained by the publication, Mother Jones Mulvaney told the John Birch Society that the Federal Reserve had “effectively devalued the dollar” and “choked off economic growth.” Mulvaney also explained to attendees that he was a fan of bitcoin and government manipulation would be nonexistent with cryptocurrency. At the Small Business Committee hearing on Bitcoin Mulvaney stated:     \n\nJust wrapped up a Small Business Committee hearing on Bitcoin. I know it isn’t a mainstream issue yet — and may not become one — but it is extraordinarily interesting and something that could eventually influence the dollar and our monetary policy. In fact, one of the witnesses drew favorable comparisons between Bitcoin and Milton Friedman.\n\nHope Trump Administration Is Favorable Towards Cryptocurrency\nBitcoin supporters hope the latest appointments made by the Trump administration will be favorable towards the cryptocurrency economy without stifling innovation. Mulvaney definitely takes keen interest in digital currencies and the underlying blockchain technology. When Coin Center revealed the initiation of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus with Representative Jared Polis, the South Carolina Republican had good things to say about this emerging technology.\n\nBlockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the financial services industry, the U.S. economy and the delivery of government services, and I’m proud to be involved with this initiative on the ground floor.\n\nWhat do you think about Mick Mulvaney being added to the Trump administration?

The central bank’s researchers suggest the only way digital currencies will sustain is through regulatory policy.\n‘Digital Currencies Will Not Be Safe Without Government Intervention’\nThe paper describes problems researchers have found with digital currencies such as bitcoin that include counterfeiting and issues with hacking. Furthermore, “Digital currencies will not be safe, although government intervention can help”, exclaims the bank’s researchers. Additionally, these digital currencies “will not be a uniform currency without government intervention”, the authors add.\nThe issue of counterfeiting “arises” with decentralized currencies not backed by a government. The authors state:\n“There is an additional problem, which is similar to counterfeiting, that arises with decentralized digital currencies that are not issued by a government or do not rely on a trusted third party (like bitcoin). This is the “double spending” problem; the possibility that someone can claim that units of the currency belong to them rather than to the person who thought they owned them.”\n\n‘Bitcoin Shows No Attempt At Uniformity’ \nMoreover, decentralized digital currencies open up a whole new world of cyber criminal activity like hacking exchanges, says the report. The authors use the recent Bitfinex hack as a reference to the reports’ hacking citations.\n“There is another problem that arises with decentralized digital currencies that do not rely on a trusted third party”, detail the Bank of Canada’s researchers. “Such currencies can suffer fraud and cyber attacks such as hacking into the system of the issuer or into the wallets that store or provide access to the digital currency. Indeed, such hacking has already occurred”.\nThe conclusion of the paper details how central banks can create their own digital currencies but concepts like bitcoin will not necessarily be driven out. The authors believe the historical research on the fiat issued in Canada in the 1800s-1900s shows important lessons. However, currencies such as bitcoin make no attempt to conform to the current monetary system making cryptocurrencies an entirely different medium of exchange.  \n“Digital currencies such as bitcoin — represent completely different units of account and, as such, make no attempt at uniformity,” the 33-page report concludes.\nWhat do you think about the Bank of Canada’s report on digital currencies needing government intervention?

    "text": "\n On February 22 the transaction queue for the Bitcoin network, otherwise known as the mempool, reached its all-time-high. During peak hours of the day, over 100,000 transactions were unconfirmed, and many people were once again experiencing significant delays.\nRelated: Bitcoin Transaction Fees Are Up More Than 1200% in Past Two Years\nBitcoin Transaction Congestion Surpasses All-Time-High\nAs the bitcoin price slowly approached the currency’s all-time-high the network also suffered from significant transaction congestion. For the past 36 hours, there has been a vast backlog of unconfirmed transactions. Currently, at press time there were 108,000 unconfirmed txs waiting in the mempool following the first record breaking 100,000 six hours prior. Of course, there have been lots of people complaining about high fees and long delays throughout the event.\n108,222 Unconfirmed transactions recorded on 2/23/17.\nBitcoin.com previously reported that fees have increased by over 1200 percent in the past two years. At present fees being recorded for high priority transactions have been averaging 0.40-0.75 cents per transaction. Alongside this, the network is trying to process 3-4 txs/s, and over 70 btc worth of fees sits in the waiting. The last time the network suffered from significant backlog was on February 2 with over 900,000 btc waiting in the transaction queue.\nDuring the rise of unconfirmed transactions on February 2 Bitcoin developer, Lukejr responded to a Reddit post asking for suggestions in regards to the 75K tx backlog that day. “Just pay a $5 fee, and it’ll go through every time unless you’re doing something stupid,” explains Lukejr. The week prior while the network was suffering from congestion on January 24, Lukejr revealed a Github BIP proposal asking to lower the block size.\nMempool transaction count recorded on 2/22/17 according to Blockchain.info.\nBlock Size Debate Remains Stagnant\nMeanwhile, throughout the congestion, these events have fired up the block size debate on both sides. Currently, there seems to be no sign of compromise for scaling solutions and bitcoin forums are filled with discussions on the best approach. Many bitcoin supporters say they are patiently waiting for Segregated Witness (Segwit), but the implementation is only supported by 26 percent of miners. Another faction of bitcoin proponents looks to the Bitcoin Unlimited client which aims to raise the block size and has 20 percent support at the moment.\nTradeblock’s mempool count recorded on 2/23/17.\nCurrent Options for Those Looking to Send Transactions Without Delay\nCurrently, the only option for bitcoin users to send a transaction without much delay is to send a transaction with the appropriate fee. 21inc offers a fee calculator to help with the process of sending high priority transactions, based on their charts which are updated every few hours. At the moment the fastest and cheapest transaction fee is 180 satoshis/byte, or for a median transaction size of 226 bytes, the fee is 40,680 satoshis.\n\nNew #Bitcoin ATH: yesterday’s median transaction fee was $0.45 (the average was $0.71) ? #ThisIsFine ?\n— Nikita Zhavoronkov (@nikzh) February 23, 2017 Another way a user can bump a transaction up the queue is by utilizing the Replace-By-Fee (RBF) option that’s available for core client users. This means nodes will accept a relayed double spend with a higher fee and miners may accept these transactions faster. Essentially RBF allows the second transaction to process with its higher fee, and the first broadcast is dropped from the network.\nAdditionally, the mining pool Viabtc has released a transaction accelerator that can be utilized to prioritize low fee transactions. Users simply submit a TXID that includes a minimum 0.0001BTC/KB fee to Viabtc’s accelerator. The transaction will then be prioritized by Viabtc, and the pool will mine these transactions on the next block they mine. However, there is a maximum of 100 txs that can be submitted every hour, but the service is completely free. Rumor has it that other pools have also created tx accelerators but will charge a fee to use the service.\nMany bitcoiners have tried to figure out why these backlogs are taking place more frequently. Some believe an individual or organization may be creating spam attacks on the network or sending significant amounts of low fee transactions. Other people suggest the congestion is due to the rising price as traders are likely exchanging bitcoins more often. Whatever the case may be the congestion has yet to subside, and the mempool transaction count continues to remain at its highest level.\nWhat do you think about the network congestion that’s been happening recently?

    "text": "\n “If you had told most people that the vast majority of Chinese trading volumes were going to disappear and Bitcoin was going to hold over $1,000, people would not have believed you just a month-and-a-half ago,” ARK blockchain products lead Chris Burniske tells Bitcoin.com. “That bitcoin’s value is potentially more supported by its transacting volume than its trading volume is counter to the narrative that bitcoin is supported mostly by speculation.”\nIndeed, it appears the Bitcoin market is adjusting to new regulations from the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) regarding areas like trading fees, margin restrictions and anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) policies.\nRelated: An Alliance Forms Under China’s New Bitcoin Regulations\nMany Bitcoiners have held their breath, their eyes towards China, in anticipation of what the future brings.\nSome market participants anticipate more regulations are forthcoming. Mr. Burniske believes, regardless of whether increased regulation is forthcoming, trading volume will likely pick up again as more institutional traders come online amid excitement over things like a potential Bitcoin ETF, which some suggest could be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission this year. \n“When you look at 2016, the ratio of trading volume on exchanges to transacting volume on bitcoin’s blockchain was ten-to-one,” the ARK Invest blockchain specialist imparts.  “A lot of critics say bitcoin has an inflated value because of speculation. But, what we’ve seen as a result of the change in Chinese regulation regarding exchanges is a significant slowdown in trading volumes globally. Right now there is more transaction volume than trading volume.”\nMr. Burniske describes how a currency fulfills three core value propositions: a means of exchange, store of value and unit of account. \n“It’s important that bitcoin continue to grow as a means of exchange,” Mr. Burniske argues. “Thus far in February, roughly 16% more bitcoin have been transacted on a daily basis than traded.” \nHe summarizes: “You have an inversion in how Bitcoin is being used, and a significant decline in trading volumes. Nonetheless, the price has been stable.” \nWhat was the source of Chinese exchange volumes? About this, there has been much speculation. \n“The most likely hypotheses for what was going on with China is algorithmic trading,” says Mr. Burniske. “There were zero fees and good liquidity. Trying to shave off small gains via algorithmic trading doesn’t necessarily provide much support to Bitcoin’s value-proposition, so losing that trading volume is not necessarily that important for Bitcoin in the long-term.” \nWhat is important is how the Bitcoin ecosystem and price has responded.\nImmediately after the PBoC actions, there was a negligible spike in Bitcoin’s volatility. But, since then, the volatility seemingly normalized. The bump that takes place in ‘Jan-17’ below represents the bump in volatility as the PBoC made its recent announcements. As you can see, the market barely shuddered. \nvia ARK Invest\n“While it might be too early to reach a conclusion, an early hypothesis is declining trading volumes in China will be replaced by another geography,” Mr. Burniske suggests. “Japan comprises now roughly 60% trading volumes, whereas before 90% went through China. The Japanese markets have shifted, as well, and you can see patterns that would suggest these are algorithmic traders. Either way, these trading volumes may not be as important as people previously imagined.”\nHe adds: “Bot traders are shifting to Japanese markets.”\nWhat do you think of Bitcoin transaction volume playing an increased role in Bitcoin amid the shakeup in China?  Images courtesy of Shutterstock, ARK Blockchain Bitcoin.com is a unique online destination in the bitcoin universe.

    "text": "\n Bitcoin transaction fees are up 1289% since March 2015 as Bitcoin transaction volume in 2017 approximates $250 million per day or about $180,000 per minute. That represents a 55% increase over 2016 and 173% over 2015. Bitcoin has added $10B to its market cap over the last year and currently processes three transactions per second.\nWhile Bitcoiners aren’t paying for bitcoin transactions like they did in May 2016, when bitcoin transaction fees peaked, 171 bitcoins in fees still went to miners on February 15. Yet the Bitcoin network continues to grow, transacting upwards of half-a-billion USD so far this year. Bitcoin’s 30-day moving average has moved towards the $1,000 mark.\nBitcoin’s Total Transaction Fees 2/17/17.\nRelated: Could Bitcoin Affect Emerging Market Monetary Policy?\nThe peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin exchange, Localbitcoins, has seen steady growth throughout its existence, with reports of increased demand for P2P trade where there is economic turmoil or capital controls.\n“[Localbitcoins] grows at quite steady, predictable pace,” founder Jeremias Kangas tells Bitcoin.com. “In some countries where inflation is high with big differences in currency exchange rates – like Nigeria, Venezuela and others –  the rate at which bitcoins are exchanged can be quite different from what the official rates into fiat are. So, bitcoin might be a more and more relevant tool to get the actual value of a specific currency in the future.”\nSome call Localbitcoins volume “light” overall but note it’s showing strong growth.\nBitcoin Transactional Volume 2017.\nThe increased demand, though, has pushed Bitcoin up against its block size limit.\nBitcoin Median Confirmation Time 2/17/17.\nThis has resulted in a two-tier bitcoin transaction process wherein miners consider high transaction fees high priority and low transaction fees low-priority.\nUnderpaid transaction fees can result in bitcoin transactions stalling. At the time of writing, there were more than 67,000 such transactions backed up in Bitcoin’s mempool, which helps the network record transactions.\nMany online exchanges handle transaction fees themselves so their users enjoy high priority transaction speed. Those who host their own clients, however, could see a bitcoin transaction held up.\nThe most important indicator of transaction fees is how large that fee is when compared to the amount of space a transaction comprises on the blockchain. Called ‘fee/size’, this measurement is taken in satoshis per byte. Bitcoin transactions comprise on average around 226 bytes of space. The current fee level for a 3 block wait transaction confirmation time is 100 satoshis per byte.\nThus, for a quick transaction, you must pay 0.00022600 bitcoins, or around 0,25 USD.\nOnce a transaction is sent, it can be monitored through a block explorer like Tradeblock or Blockchain.info. To find your transaction, you will need to know the transaction ID, often visible in a Bitcoin wallet’s transaction history.\n21 Inc. has bought the service Cointape and rebranded it into a tool listing current estimated confirmation times for transactions based on different fee sizes.

    "text": "\n For the EU and US, the Wild West days of bitcoin are over. 2017 will be the year of bitcoin regulation and taxation during which individuals need information and caution. \nAlso Read: Fedcoin: The U.S. Will Issue E-Currency That You Will Use\nThe bad news: Central bankers want private, centralized blockchains to facilitate all movement of wealth so they can skim the top. Complicit governments intend to regulate competitors, including individual wallet holders, and then collect a ‘fee’ in the form of taxes.\nThe good news: Bitcoin cannot be regulated without disabling the internet or the bitcoin network, which is arguably the largest and most diverse network in the world. “If you want to kill Bitcoin, it will be an impossible task,” the Former Governor of the Bank of China LH Li recently stated.\nMore bad news: Central banks and governments will try. LH Li added, “So it [bitcoin] will continue to exist. What is important now is that we should properly regulate it.”\nTo avoid becoming collateral damage, individuals should plan now.\nOf course, the real threat to most readers is not China but the EU or the US, both of which are signaling specific plans to regulate and eventually tax cryptocurrencies.\nEU’s Coming War on Bitcoin\nFrom January 16 to 18, an international conference of some 400 representatives of intelligence units met in Doha, Qatar to discuss the ‘problem’ of money laundering (tax evasion) through digital currencies. The conference sprang from an alliance between the Basil Institute, Europol and Interpol. Bitcoin was mentioned by name; “Special attention should be given to the international exchange of suspicious Bitcoin addresses that threaten economic stability.” Economic stability is bureaucratese for economic control.\nSix recommendations for action resulted.  In summary:\n\nIncrease information sharing;\nIncrease training for investigators, regulators, prosecutors and judges. Establish international standards by which to share information;\nPrepare national guidelines for “all entities operating” in cryptocurrency with special attention on “transparency and on access to information”;\nRegulate Digital Currencies Exchanges and Wallet Providers under current money laundering and terrorism legislation;\nAct against “Mixers/Tumblers” which “are designed exclusively to anonymize transactions….[Their] existence…should not…be tolerated”;\nConsider creating the crime of “unexplained wealth.”\n\nExchanges and wallet providers are targeted because they are low-hanging fruit. They are far easier to detect and regulate than individuals, which is why individual wallets are the most private alternative. Conventional merchants who accept bitcoin are almost certainly next, and for the same reason as exchanges.\nSome impending measures are obvious.\nEU nations will accelerate information sharing, especially of blacklisted bitcoin addresses. EU members that were formerly friendly to bitcoin, such as the Netherlands, may turn hostile.\nAnti-money laundering regulations and “Know Your Customer” policies will be imposed on exchanges and wallet Providers. For those who value privacy, this is a fine time to consider relocating from exchanges that will function as an arm of the state to exchanges that will put their customers first.\nKnow Your Bank. Know Your Government. Know Your Exchange.\nThe use of mixers and tumblers will be de facto evidence of illegal activity. The EU wants to track ‘suspicious’ transactions in real time and it will “not tolerate” being denied. Again, those who value privacy should consider exchanges that are not within unfriendly resident nations.\nThe crime of “unexplained wealth” is becoming globally popular, with Australia and the UK actively proposing legislation. Turning “unexplained wealth” into a criminal offense gives the tax people a blank check to sift through the worth of everything you own, of every cent you receive. You are guilty until or unless you can demonstrate innocence to the tax man’s satisfaction. If your assets appear disproportionately high compared to your income, then be prepared to document the sources. Of course, it is possible to live within your visible means and carefully document it.\nUS’s Coming War on Bitcoin\nCoinbase, a popular American cryptocurrency service provider, is a cautionary tale on several levels.\nIn March 2014, the IRS issued its “Virtual Currency Guidance” on the tax requirements for cryptocurrencies. The guide created confusion more than it clarified. Lacking an enforcement mechanism and, perhaps, tripping over its own tangled requirements, the IRS sought a nuclear solution.\nIn November 2016, the IRS served Coinbase with a John Doe Summons for the  transaction records of all users between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. A “John Doe” summons does not identify a person but aims at a group or class of people. Because one Coinbase user might be guilty of a crime, all records were to be examined.\nMany people asked “Why Coinbase?”\nCoinbase has a reputation for being hyper-compliant with regulations and government demands. Coinbase’s co-founder Brian Armstrong stated, “At Coinbase, our first priority is to ensure that we operate the most secure and compliant digital currency exchange in the world.” Surely this is the last exchange with which the IRS needs to use brute force.\nBut it makes sense that Coinbase would be the first exchange approached; the IRS wants to set a chilling example to others. It may have assumed Coinbase would cave to its demands and an important precedent would be easily established. Coinbase reportedly dug in its heels with Armstrong announcing, “We will likely incur a legal cost of between $100,000 and $1,000,000 in the process of defending our customers from this overly broad subpoena.” The cryptocurrency community applauded.\nThere is a phenomenon known as “demonstrated preference,” however. In short, when a person’s words contradict his actions, you should believe the actions. Coinbase’s recent actions and surrounding events raise the possibility that Armstrong’s announcement was either PR or a position from which he has backed down.\nConsider:\n\nA January 17, 2017 headline in Fortune read “New York Warms Up to This Bitcoin Exchange With New License.” It is unlikely that New York State, which is notoriously tough on license applications, would favor an IRS non-compliant Exchange.\nA February 3 headline in Forbes read “IRS Gets Court Approval To Delay Hearing On Access To Coinbase Accounts.” The IRS told the court, “if more time is provided a hearing on movants’ motions may be avoided altogether, sparing the Court’s judicial resources and the Parties’ time and expense.” This hints at a private settlement.\nA February 9 headline in Forbes read “Blockchain Tech CEO [Perry Woodin, CEO of Node40] Says Tax Form 1099-B Won’t Work For All Virtual Currency.” The article discussed Armstrong’s recommendations on how Coinbase could more “reasonably” comply with tax demands. This hints at compromise.\nA February 17 headline in CoinTelegraph read “’Police Friendly’ Coinbase Used to Sell Bitcoin Seized in Investigations.” The article described how one police department’s asset forfeiture account was linked to Coinbase. The exchange is cozy with state actions, including asset forfeiture theft.\nA February 18 headline in NEWSBTC read “eGifter Now Only Accepts Bitcoin Payments From Coinbase Wallet Owners.” The article states, “Using Coinbase of all exchanges may seem a bit strange, though. The company is facing an IRS John Doe summons….While people who use eGifter have been nothing to hide per se, it is perhaps not the best exchange to use for bitcoin payments.” Of course, Coinbase could use a “separate and secure wallet service” for those payments but it could also be out from under the IRS.\n\nNone of the preceding is a smoking gun. Taken together, however, they suggest a pattern: whatever Coinbase states publicly, it seems to continue a course of hyper-compliance. If so, the IRS will undoubtedly pursue other exchanges in the same manner. If so, bitcoiners should use Coinbase and affiliated agencies with full knowledge.\nConclusion\nA poster on Steemit captured the governmental zeitgeist toward bitcoin when he wrote, “The old axiom goes, if you can’t beat them, join them. But for the establishment cartels that seek to rule the world through control over the global monetary system, their addendum to this is, if you can’t beat them, usurp them.”\nThe EU and US cannot beat bitcoin in a fair fight. They cannot beat bitcoin in a rigged fight. But they are going to try. One way or the other, users should get out of the path of damage.  Images via Shutterstock.

    "text": "\n Bitcoin.com is pleased to announce the release of its revamped voting tool, Bitcoinocracy, at vote.bitcoin.com. Bitcoinocracy allows bitcoiners to vote with their bitcoin holdings on block size, segregated witness, and many other bitcoin proposals.\nRelated: Bitcoin.com Adds Stash Node Pro to its Online Store\nBitcoinocracy Enables Bitcoin Stakeholders to ‘Put Money Where Their Mouth Is’ \nIn 2015, Bitcoinocracy creator Arsen Gasparian developed a tool that enables voting backed by monetary value and transparency. Bitcoin is not “spent” on Bitcoinocracy —rather, addresses and the bitcoins therein are applied to totals in support of different sides of various issues. This solution can show not how many people support an issue, but rather how many bitcoins support an issue. \nGasparian explains that the idea of Proof of Stake (PoS) voting is not new and has been used in the past with traditional stakeholder voting procedures. The idea of Bitcoinocracy was born from the heated block size debate because Gasparian felt meaningful discussions were becoming controlled and censored on forums. So, he created a tool that would allow the people to “put their money where their mouth is” on various issues. \n“That’s why I decided to eventually implement a way for the Bitcoin holders to express their opinion anonymously and incontrovertibly,” explains Gasparian. “I hope that Bitcoinocracy will allow bitcoin owners to overcome any kind of censorship and express their opinion on issues that are important to them. Bitcoin holders are not just clients of a proprietary payment system. They are the owners – the stakeholders that give it value and pay miners the mining reward. They have something at stake, and they should have a voice. It is only fair. I hope Bitcoinocracy will give them the power.”\nImportant issues being voted on at Bitcoinocracy.\nThe Power of Bitcoin Signatures \nUsers of Bitcoinocracy can vote on existing propositions such as development, fungibility concerns, BIP proposals, and even other subjects like whether or not a God exists. Users can additionally submit their own propositions to the platform on subjects they believe are important voting topics. “Most popular wallets support the set of BIPs (BIP21 and BIP70-72) to simplify the purchase/payment process,” says Gasparian. “All the user needs to do is to click the hyperlink on the website and to confirm the payment.” \n\n“I think a typical Bitcoin user doesn’t yet fully understand the power of Bitcoin signatures. They can be used not only for payments, but also for authentication, voting, signing contracts, etc. Part of the reason why people don’t use them is that the signing functionality is often hidden or inconvenient.”\n\nBitcoin.com encourages readers to check out the Bitcoinocracy platform. Maybe there’s an important issue you want people to vote on. Perhaps you’d like to contribute your signature to a pre-existing proposition. Bitcoinocracy is an entirely decentralized way the Bitcoin community can measure a stance on any given proposal or debate. By utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain, voting is cast with bitcoin through a cryptographic signature. The blockchain’s immutability ensures signed votes cannot be manipulated and will always be available to the public.\nCheck out Bitcoinocracy at vote.bitcoin.com today and make your voice heard!\nWhat do you think about Bitcoinocracy?

It’s a technology platform that fintech is being built on top of — It is a once in a generation investment opportunity similar to the internet, growing just as fast if not faster. It’s the internet of money. I’m not alone on this. Everybody’s involved in it — the Federal Reserve just released a paper on it and has a working group. Bank of England is involved in it, fourteen of the top thirty banks have active projects going on. JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, CME, and NYSE are all involved in projects as we speak building on top of this technology.”\n\nSo let’s just say — let’s try to put a value on Bitcoin, and let’s say all those things don’t happen. Even though there are so many people working on it and building on top of the platform, giving it use cases — Let’s say it is digital gold and for some reason it just happens to get one percent of the market share that gold gets, bitcoin would be $4,500 and is trading at $1,200 right now — If it got five percent of the market share it would be at $22,000. That to me is a winning investment.\n\nSchiff: ‘Bitcoin is Digital Fool’s Gold Similar to Beanie Babies’\nAs usual, the gold bug in Schiff remains unfazed by the comments of bitcoin supporters. In fact, during the debate, Schiff calls Brian Kelly a member of a “cult” who is obsessed with the digital currency. \n“Well it’s not digital gold I agree,” details Schiff’s rebuttal. “It’s digital ‘fools gold’. You know today’s bitcoins are like beanie babies. The whole principle behind bitcoin was to replicate the properties that made gold uniquely suited to be money and act as an alternative to fiat currencies. But it’s not really viable as a money — I mean it is a potential medium of exchange, but it’s not a store of value. Meanwhile, nobody really uses it as a medium of exchange it’s just a speculative asset. People own it because they think it’s going to be more valuable in the future but it has no intrinsic value.”\nBrian Kelly quickly interjects stating, “150,000 merchants worldwide accept bitcoin, including Expedia. [Bitcoin] has 300,000 transactions a day.” However, Schiff disagrees that merchants actually accept the digital currency. Schiff believes this is a “gimmick” and these companies who accept bitcoin are actually accepting dollars or euros.\n“No, no. No merchants accept bitcoin,” explains Schiff. “They work with a company called Bitpay. They accept dollars. There are no merchants that price their merchandise in bitcoin. It’s impossible. It’s a gimmick to try and pretend.”\n\nPeople are using it to circumvent currency laws to transfer money out of China. They are not really using it in commerce. You find me a merchant that is pricing in bitcoin. They are pricing in dollars or euros. — The volatility is too great on a daily basis to really price it. Gold had a long history of intrinsic value before it was money. People desired it for its properties, and it was very scarce, so it had a lot of value because its unique properties were hard to come by. Nobody knew what bitcoin was five or ten years ago. It didn’t exist. It has no value other than the fact that maybe you can use it to exchange it for something else.\n\n‘Gold is Just a Shiny Rock’\nKelly counters arguing that bitcoin has the same usefulness that gold has. “Bitcoin has the exact same value as gold has,” Kelly shouts above Schiff’s commentary. “It has the same exact value as gold has… Gold is just a rock. It doesn’t have any special values. It’s just a shiny rock.” \nSchiff responds: “There is no limit to the number of digital currencies that can be created. There are hundreds of others. Why doesn’t anyone use Myspace? Because somebody came up with Facebook.”\n\nPoll: Who won the debate?\n— CNBC's Fast Money (@CNBCFastMoney) February 27, 2017 The latest Fast Money debate on CNBC shows once again Schiff will not give bitcoin a chance as an investment, especially when compared to gold. Schiff has appeared many times on CNBC stating that bitcoin is basically worthless in his eyes. During the bitcoin price rise in 2013, Schiff said bitcoin was in a bubble and is similar to a “modern-day tulip mania.” \nNotably, Schiff’s precious metals company has been accepting bitcoin for gold purchases since 2014.\nWhat do you think about the debate between Brian Kelly and Peter Schiff?

    "text": "\n Some new revelations have been coming from China concerning the recent bitcoin exchange policies within the region. The leading exchange BTCC has revealed it will be offering zero fees for USD/BTC trades for one month. Meanwhile, Chinese exchanges are beginning to lift withdrawal suspensions but are asking for further customer identification.\nRelated: The Butterfly Effect of Bitcoin’s Exchange Regulations\nBTCC Initiates Zero Fees for USD/BTC Trading While New Verification Processes Affect Chinese Traders\nThroughout the new year, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) have been enforcing new regulatory rules across the Chinese bitcoin exchange industry. China’s top exchanges have added fees to trades, removed future options, and a few exchanges suspended BTC withdrawals. Just recently BTCC has announced its USD bitcoin exchange promotion offering zero fees until March 31. The company’s move may be a reaction to try and stimulate more trading as BTCChina trades will still implement fees.\n\nFurthermore, a source from the region tells Bitcoin.com that new rules have been applied for certain Chinese exchange withdrawals. It seems some exchanges are allowing withdrawals with no official announcements. Our correspondent also explains that withdrawing from BTCC now requires ID card and video verification. He explains to our readers his experience trying to withdraw from BTCC stating:\n\nOnce the picture ID verification passes, BTCC further asks you for a video verification. Guess, I won’t do that today. The last withdraw I made from there, required no such verifications at all.\n\nPBOC Cracks Down on All Types of Futures Trading Across the Country\nThe central bank’s regulatory pressure may not be entirely focused on bitcoin trading. The PBOC has also issued warnings to other types of exchanges that utilize future options and margin lending practices. This past January a meeting with provincial government leaders took place in Beijing to clean up these types of trading practices over the course of six months. Bitcoin exchanges are not mentioned in the latest warning but targets companies that exchange futures on oil, collectible stamps, precious metals and more. The news seems to be correlated as the PBOC is cracking down on these types of trades and bitcoin exchanges in China have stopped futures and lending practices.\nMeanwhile, as bitcoin exchanges change their rules traders in China are flocking to new avenues like Localbitcoins, and OTC markets like Richfund. Both Paxful and Localbitcoin’s volumes in China have reached an all-time high this past February. As far as the other regional bitcoin exchanges are concerned trading volumes have nosedived significantly. Furthermore, while all eyes continue to focus on events in China, bitcoin trading in Japan takes the lead in volume globally.\nWhat do you think about the recent developments taking place in China?

    "text": "\n Proof-of-existence (PoE) is a utility built into the Bitcoin blockchain that allows anyone to store records in an immutable fashion. \nAlso read: Bitcoin Nostalgia: Can Some Bitcoins Be Worth More Than Others?\nStoring Records on the Bitcoin Blockchain\nStored records held on the blockchain may not have legal implementations at the moment but very well could in the near future. For instance, the state of Arizona has introduced a bill recognizing blockchain-based contracts into the legal system. Even so, using the distributed database to safekeep certain data will make sure your records are cemented in history. This includes documents such as a will, a land title, digital copyrights, and more. Digitally storing your records on the Bitcoin blockchain takes a bit of practice but can be done by anyone.\nRSA Encryption, a Message Digest, and Bitcoin’s Public Blockchain  \nThe best way to create a stored document that is meant to be private on a public blockchain is to encrypt the data. The first thing you want to do is create some public and private keys using your computer. Any operating system can generate these keys with programs like ssh-keygen for Linux and Apple users, and Windows users can use a software called Puttygen.\nPublic-key or asymmetric cryptography uses mathematically tethered keys that allow for encryption and decryption protocols. Using Puttygen, users just launch the program and click ‘generate RSA keys’, enter a unique key passphrase, and save the newly created public and private keys.\nSaving public and private keys using Puttygen\nAfter receiving the key pair, the next step is to create a message digest where you will add the document, record, or text to a hash function. Message digest software can be found online and computes a string of different cryptographic algorithms such as MD2, MD4, MD5, and SHA-256. By creating the message digest, this will create a unique input for the data you recorded. Following this step, you want to encrypt the information using your newly created private key which also adds your digital signature to the information. There are a few different ways to prepare the data for a blockchain PoE scheme. For instance, software developer Chris Ellis explains how to create a world citizenship certificate on Github with an XML or JSON file using digital signatures and the blockchain. \nTethering your private key to a message digest.\nLastly, you want to tether the signed message digest to your document and add it to the Bitcoin blockchain. One must remember that the blockchain can be used to hash a message digest’s string of characters into a transaction, which is not the same as ‘attaching’ a document or file into the blockchain. The document or file is not stored there only the keys or string of digits attached to a transaction represents the proof of ownership. There are a few ways to add text or a string of digits and record it to the public blockchain. This, in turn, is basically your digitally signed ‘representation’ of your document. Many other messages found on the blockchain are in hex code like Satoshis Genesis block text. These particular kinds of blockchain messages were created using the coinbases‘ 100 bytes of arbitrary text.     \nThe last step can get a bit technical, but if you can complete the steps above, you should be able to follow some online guides that explain how to add a document to the blockchain on your own. There are also online resources that can perform this service for you and apply your data to the blockchain in just a few minutes. PoE services that are currently available include BTProof, Proofofexistence.com, Signatura, and a few others.\nBoston’s technical university MIT also offers a PoE certificate program that can add academic records to the blockchain. However, always remember when using these services, you are entrusting the integrity of your data to a third-party. \nThe Bitcoin blockchain has a vast amount of publicized text in hex strings including a Nelson Mandela tribute text, Satoshi’s genesis message, a Len Sassaman Tribute, Wikileaks cablegate data, and thousands more. Additionally, people have used the blockchain to record a baby’s birth certificate, create a global passport, and a marriage certificate.  \nSatoshi’s message found in the genesis block.\nProving Ownership and Learning Cryptography\nUsing the Bitcoin blockchain’s feature of PoE can be quite beneficial to demonstrate digital ownership of a document. The blockchain also timestamps the information as soon as the transaction processes. This, in turn, will register the data securely throughout a global distributed network allowing a user to prove ownership with the digital signature at any given time in the future. Because this action removes the need for some third-party verification in the future, this use case may affect the legal system, law firms, notarization services and more. Learning how to create public/private keys, and applying secure documents to Bitcoin’s powerful blockchain gives a fascinating look into the world of cryptography.\nHave you ever added a document to the blockchain?

    "text": "\n For several years now Blockstream and Core supporters have been advocating a “fee market” and having full blocks all the time. Many have even gone so far as to claim that Bitcoin is unstable without full blocks, while completely ignoring that the blocks were not full for the first 8 years of Bitcoin’s existence.\nAs any Bitcoin user knows, the network is completely full now.  Every business is spending countless hours dealing with customer support requests relating to transaction that haven’t confirmed. In the last year confirmation times have gone up from about 10 minutes, to nearly two hours!\nI was stunned earlier today when I came across a service that now allows people to pay with CREDIT CARDS to have their Bitcoin transaction confirmed!\n\nThis certainly isn’t the bitcoin that I signed up for, and I think everyone should be shocked by how bad things have now gotten thanks to Core and Blockstream’s misguided economic policies.\nSegwit is not the answer.\nIt is worth noting that this kind of fee market is exactly what the current Core team have been advocating for years. Now they have it, and it is a disaster just like myself, Gavin Andresen, and many others have been saying all along. The owners of Friendster, and then Myspace thought that it would be impossible for any other social network to supplant their position. Facebook proved them wrong.\n\nThe current Core developers think that it is impossible for any currency to supplant Bitcoin, but if Bitcoin doesn’t grow and adapt to keep up with consumer demand, it will be replaced by something that does, and it will be the current Core developer’s fault for blocking every on chain scaling attempt and intentionally implementing disastrous economic policies.\nIf you love Bitcoin and want to see it become a currency used all over the world,  it is time to reject the insane economic policies of Blockstream and Core,  and support Bitcoin Unlimited instead.\nThis article was originally published here.

    "text": "\n Silence surrounds the probable impact of Trump on Bitcoin because there’s a dearth of facts. Some indications hint at a favorable impact however, even as they pose threats to freedom and prosperity. Indeed, sometimes its because of the threat that bitcoin could surge forward as a safe haven and the solution to the problems government creates. Here’s a sampling of what users can expect: two unintended consequences and two slug-matches brewing. \nBitcoin To The Rescue on Government-Created Problems\nConsider two examples.\n1) Trump vows to impound or tax remittances sent by Illegal immigrants back to Mexico because the money constitutes “illegal wages.”\n‘Illegal’ Mexicans commonly send most of their earnings back home to their families. According to World Bank estimates, such personal remittances amounted to $26,164,387.99 in 2015. The World Banks added, “three of the most frequently used remittance service companies [are] Western Union (6.1%), MoneyGram (6.64%), CitiBank (14.59%) charge 9.11% on average, excluding the conversion fees.”\n‘Illegals’ will almost certainly seek a less formal and untaxed path to send remittances home. And Bitso, the largest bitcoin conversion exchange in Mexico, offers a solution; over 130,000 locations in Mexico conveniently convert pesos and greenbacks in and out of bitcoin. Predictably, if allowed by government, other companies will compete and keep the fees reasonable.\nSkeptics of crypto-remittances cite the difficulty ‘illegals’ have in obtaining bitcoin. But a January 27 Bitcoin.com article, “How Trump’s Wall and Remittance Tax Could Give Bitcoin a Boost,” described how the obstacle could be vaulted.\n\nConfiscated or highly-taxed remittances become alienated from customary transmission routes;\nBitcoin services aim at ‘illegals’ – for example, by not requiring social security numbers or streamlining the remittance of bitcoins;\nThe services avoid reporting or follow compliance regulations, perhaps by functioning on the gray market or having a loop-hole status.\n\n2. The Trump admin wants to clamp down on marijuana even in states where it is legal. \nFormer Fed crackdowns have prompted legal marijuana dealers to switch to bitcoin. Operation Choke Point, for example, was a Department of Justice attempt to freeze such dealers out of the traditional banking system. A Nov. 7, 2016, Bitcoin.com article, “Colorado Cannabis Operations Begin Banking With Bitcoin,“ stated, “the banking industry under the U.S. Federal Reserve wants nothing to do with cannabis money, because marijuana is still illegal at the federal level.” Alternate payment systems, like Paypal, also caved to federal pressure.\nEnter bitcoin with no need for bank accounts, or third parties and with lower fees. Enter companies, like 1620 Solutions, with the motto “Hemp Currency = Bitcoin.”\nMore federal crackdowns are likely to drive marijuana even closer to bitcoin. If the assault merely continues to freeze dealers out of traditional payment paths, then the cryptocurrency will function and flourish openly. If the assault is more repressive, with raids and the confiscation of assets, then bitcoin use will go gray or black market. But the marijuana market will survive and become solidly crypto or cash.\nSome Intended Indications For Bitcoin\n\nThe foregoing examples are unintended consequences. That is, the use of bitcoin as remittances and as a banking substitute were not intended by the new policies. They are by-products. Other Trump signals more directly address bitcoin.\nConsider another two examples.\n1. Trump clearly intends to relax regulations on the traditional banking system.\nHis plans include “dismantling” the Dodd-Frank Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, giving the financial sector more freedom in such practices as issuing loans. (Both were viewed as consumer protections in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis.)\nPresumably, the Durbin Amendment, which is part of Dodd-Frank, would also be repealed. The amendment limits what credit cards can charge merchants for swipe fees. Thus, the cost of receiving credit card payments would almost certainly rise for businesses, making the cost of goods and services rise for card users. Businesses would return to or increase the practice of giving discounts for cash or cash-equivalents. Customers would be incentivized to adopt cryptocurrencies.\n2. The Feds and New York State are jousting about which one will lead in the regulation of bitcoin –  the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) or the NY Department of Financial Services (DFS).\nNo one knows where the feds will land on bitcoin. The appointment of long-time bitcoin enthusiast Mick Mulvaney to head the Office of Management and Budget is encouraging but says nothing substantial. One thing is clear, however: New York State thinks it knows Trump’s intentions. A battle to ‘own’ the regulation of bitcoin issue is poised to begin, and a challenged Trump does not back down, especially when challenged in his own backyard of NY.\nEstablished in 2011, the DFS is arguably now the most aggressive bitcoin licensing agency in America. A January 17 Press Release was entitled “DFS Superintendent [Maria T.] Vullo Submits Comment Letter to OCC in Opposition of Proposed Special Purpose National Bank Charter for ‘Fintech’ Companies.” The letter vehemently opposed the OCC’s proposal to start regulating fintech:s, which would include bitcoin institutions. Vullo stated, “The OCC should not use technological advances as an excuse to attempt to usurp state laws that already regulate fintech activities.”\nThe feds versus New York state will be a slug match for financial authority. Whether other Trump-hostile states, like California, follow suit is not clear but likely. Bitcoin could become a state’s rights issue, especially since huge revenue is involved. Whether this would be good for bitcoin is unpredictable.\nConclusion\nWhether through unintended consequences or by targeted policies, whether on the open or gray market, bitcoin will rise in value under Trump. The wild card is state’s rights.\nWhat do you think about bitcoin under the Trump administration? Let us know in the comments below.

    "text": "\n Now bitcoiners have another topic to consider as Trump has beefed up U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) policies with agents searching the phones of travelers at border checkpoints.\nAlso read: The Digital Revolution Increases Sovereignty\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection Agents Are Coercing Travelers for Mobile Passwords\nBitcoin.com has covered many different aspects concerning Bitcoin under the Trump administration. Everything from Bitcoin supporters being appointed to the administration, the planned wall in Mexico, and the possibility of some financial regulations ending. However, Bitcoin proponents may have something to worry about if they travel inside the U.S. border. According to various reports, CBP agents are increasingly searching phones and electronic devices. Even though the CBP and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) legally cannot search electronic devices without a warrant they have been doing so for quite some time. Just recently a U.S.-born scientist was forced to reveal his NASA-issued mobile phone password at a border checkpoint.\nSidd Bikkannavar gave up the passcode to the CBP agent while he waited thirty minutes for it to be returned. According to the CBP the agents had performed an algorithm test looking for threats to national security, but found none.\n“This is a huge, huge violation of my work policy. This is a matter of great concern,” explained Bikkannavar.\n\nMore Instances of Passphrase Searches \nThe violation of privacy is setting a precedent and could have severe implications towards bitcoin users keeping wealth on their mobile devices. Moreover, there have been other recorded events in the U.S. of border agents looking for passwords to electronic devices over the past few months. Just last month the New York Times reported on a man named Haisam Elsharkawi who was detained by the CBP for three hours after his flight. According to Elsharkawi, CBP officials pestered him for the phones passphrase and asked if they could view his contacts, social media apps, and photographs.\n“I travel all the time, and I was never asked to unlock my phone,” Mr. Elsharkawi told the press. “I have personal photos there, which I think is normal for anyone. It’s my right. It’s my phone.”\nAccording to the CBP, the agency details they can seize your mobile device and may keep it to copy data off of the device. Those who have experienced a phone seizure have said the agency could take your phone for weeks as the CBP states they will “return your property within a reasonable time upon completion of examination.”\nOne instance of Bitcoin going through customs made headlines back in March of 2014. Bitcoin Not Bombs founder, Davi Barker was harassed by a group of plain-clothed TSA agents. Barker’s luggage was swabbed as the TSA employees said, “We saw bitcoin in your bag and need to check.” According to the agents, the security team was concerned with international travelers carrying more than $10,000 in digital currency.   \nAgents Could Easily Gain Access to Bitcoin Wallets and Private Keys\nThe fact of the matter is a lot of bitcoin users carry funds on their mobile device. Phones contain bitcoin wallets, and some even show a mnemonic seed phrase to your private keys. On top of that, government authorities can take the device and copy all the data using their own discretion, and ironically, in private. Additionally, the CBP may also share the device with other agencies for technical assistance and decryption.\n\n“The information may be made available to other agencies for investigation and/or for obtaining assistance relating to jurisdictional or subject matter expertise, or for translation, decryption, or other technical assistance,” explains the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.\n\nOf course, agents will need a passphrase, but it seems coercing people to give one up is all too easy these days. The implications of these events with U.S. customs can be frightening for all individuals who recognize privacy as a fundamental sovereign right. All of the sudden, certain rules under Trump’s new guidelines may not be so pleasing to bitcoin enthusiasts after all.\nWhat do you think about the U.S. Customs and Border Protection pressuring people to give up their phones and passphrases?

Those fundamental factual differences and disputes involve whether Bitcoin is a ‘financial product’ or service which impacts whether Defendants-Respondents had the authority to regulate Bitcoin, and whether Defendants-Respondents acted in an arbitrary and capricious fashion when they designed the Regulation.”\nTheo Chino\nThe court must grant such a request when a petition “is likely to be material and necessary to the prosecution or defense of the proceedings.”\nIf Bitcoin is not a “financial product or service,” then the NYFDS’ cross-motion to dismiss should be denied. Indeed, regulators worldwide continue examining the regulatory implications of bitcoin.\nGovernment reports issued this year on distributed ledger technology, sometimes referred to as ‘blockchain’, imply market regulators are investigating related technologies in the context of current and possible future laws and regulations. \n“It is premature to fully appreciate the changes that the technology could bring and the regulatory response that may be needed, given that the technology is still evolving and practical applications are limited both in number and scope,” reads a recent report by the European Securities and Markets Authority called ‘The Distributed Ledger Technology Applies to Securities Markets.’\nFINRA stated in a report called ‘Implications of Blockchain for Securities Markets‘ that it “welcomes an open dialogue with market participants to help proactively identify and address any potential risks or hurdles in order to tap into the full potential of DLT, while maintaining the core principles of investor protection and market integrity.”\nThe UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”), and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) have all created so-called “regulatory sandboxes” to better understand blockchain technology. \nThe hearing between Theo Chino and the NYFDS is scheduled for March 16, 2017 at 9:30 A.M.\nDo you think it is time to regulate Bitcoin?

    "text": "\n As blockchain surveillance rises, the need for private financial transactions for bitcoin has become a holy grail for bitcoiners. Over the past few months, many Bitcoin proponents have been focused on the Tumblebit project, a protocol that aims to anonymize transactions. This week, the blockchain development company Stratis has announced “Breeze Wallet”, a protocol that will implement Tumblebit into a “real-world production environment.”\nStratis Announces ‘Breeze Wallet’ a Tumblebit SPV Wallet in C# \nStratis is a blockchain development platform that allows developers and enterprises the ability to test and deploy blockchain-based applications. The platform equips programmers with a blockchain building interface using C# and the Microsoft .NET Framework. The company, founded in 2016 by Chris Trew, aims to provide clients with end-to-end solutions for distributed ledger development.\nEarlier this year, the startup announced the company’s daemon alpha release that affords users the ability to publicly test a Bitcoin full node written in C# for the .NET Core platform. With the help of Bitcoin core developer Nicolas Dorier, the platform allows testing concepts like Tumblebit and Segregated witness in a production environment. On March 2, the company announced project “Breeze Wallet” which they claim will be one of the first Bitcoin wallets to address the privacy issues in blockchain transactions.\n“Presently there is a huge demand for privacy on the blockchain”, Stratis details. “One of the main hurdles faced by the adoption of blockchain technologies in the financial services industry is the privacy of financial data on the blockchain”.\nTumblebit Researcher Will Advise the Breeze Wallet Development Team \nAdam Ficsor Nbitcoin developer and Tumblebit contributor.\nTo be able to build the Breeze Wallet to the Tumblebit specifications, the company will be helped by Adam Ficsor, a contributor to the Tumblebit research paper. Stratis details Ficsor will give technical advisement towards the development of a production-ready Tumblebit full block SPV wallet in C#. The team hopes Breeze Wallet could become the “de-facto wallet” that offers enhanced privacy for bitcoin transactions worldwide. According to Ficsor, blockchain surveillance is a not at all theoretical and unfortunately a reality for cryptocurrency users.\n“Everyone who is not using Bitcoin Core had all their addresses linked together by third parties”, Ficsor explains. “This is not a theoretical “assume the worst case” strategy; this is reality. The third parties are either the central servers your wallet relies on or, in case of SPV wallets, all blockchain surveillance companies”.\nCurrently, there is no completion date set for the Breeze Wallet project. Stratis says Tumblebit is fully compatible with today’s Bitcoin protocol and the startup says they have taken the initial steps to make Tumblebit a “reality in the shortest term”.\nWhat do you think about Stratis developing a Tumblebit SPV wallet?

    "text": "\n A recent opinion piece coming from the publication the Hill has exclaimed that if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), it will lead mainstream investors to “slaughter.”\nAlso Read: The New 110% Unlimited Bitcoin.com Mining Pool is Now Open to Everyone\nHill Author Believes SEC Approving a Bitcoin ETF Bolsters Criminal Activity\nA contributing columnist for the Hill, Jim Angel thinks a bitcoin ETF is a bad idea and not in the public’s best interest. Essentially, the author does believe in ‘blockchain technology’, but bitcoin is primarily used for “money laundering, ransomware, tax evasion and other criminal activities” according to Angel. The article states that if SEC approves these bitcoin-backed ETFs it will only further bolster these types of illicit activities.\n“Blockchain has many legitimate applications, but Bitcoin 1.0 is not one of them,” explains the Hill opinion piece. “Bitcoin is a payment system ideally suited to the black market. The anonymity of bitcoin transactions makes it ideal for drug-running, terrorist funding and human trafficking. Bitcoin is the “coin of the realm” in the dark web.”\nThe author details the last time he discussed bitcoin with others he asked if anyone had used the digital currency before. He explains the last time he talked about bitcoin and asked this question one person disclosed they were hacked by ransomware. In his opinion, the primary use for bitcoin is only for criminal activity, and he believes no one has explained this detail to the SEC agency. “For this reason alone the SEC should reject them based on inadequate disclosure,” the author concludes.\nCoin Center Fires Back \nCoin Center’s Jerry Brito.\nFollowing the article, the digital currency and blockchain legislative advocacy group Coin Center’s Jerry Brito blasted back at the Hill author for being very “misguided.” Brito explains the author just spouts off personal opinions and doesn’t cite substantial evidence proving them.\n“The advent of the Internet led to rampant piracy, the proliferation of porn and illegal gambling, easier criminal communications, anonymous harassment, as well as new kinds of confidence scams,” Brito explains. “Could you imagine if the government in the early 1990s took advice like that of Mr. Angel? Advice that amounts to, ‘Please look only at the potential costs of this technology and ignore all the potential benefits because they’re too unproven and uncertain.’ We would be much, much poorer today.”\n\nBitcoin Funds Far Less Illegal Activity Than Traditional Payments \nTime and time again mainstream media has tried to portray bitcoin in a negative light. Moreover, the Hill author forgets to mention that many other payment rails like cash and credit cards fund quite a bit of illegal operations. It is true that bitcoin has been used in ransomware and other illicit activities. Just as it is true malicious malware also uses Paypal and pre-paid cards. Ransomware has been around since 1989, well before bitcoin. The rest of the illegal black market deeds mentioned in the Hill article are also heavily funded by fiat reserves, credit cards, mainstream payment providers, as well as by gold and diamonds. \nThe small twenty billion dollar bitcoin economy pales in comparison to the criminal activities financed by traditional mainstream mediums of exchange, even ones that have ETFs.\nWhat do you think about the Hill opinion piece against a bitcoin ETF?

    "text": "\n In the world of open source code, Bitcoin is already one of the most popular projects and protocols being worked on today. Like price, regulations, and merchant adoption, software development is a major metric that can be used to gauge the growth of Bitcoin. The number of projects involving Bitcoin on the leading development platform and repository, Github, crossed over 10,000 last week and is currently sitting at 10,055 at press time.\nAlso read: Zeronet Wants to Replace the Dark Web by Marrying Bitcoin to Bittorrent Over Tor\nPopular Open Source Projects\nLike Bitcoin, most projects on Github are open source, meaning that anyone can copy them to make new versions with the changes they want. These spin-off projects are called ‘forks’. Bitcoin currently has 7,535 forked projects on Github, many of which are altcoins.\nMeanwhile, a search on the site for “Bitcoin” yields 10,055 Bitcoin-related projects. Putting this number into perspective, Bitcoin.com examined the search results for other protocols for comparison.\nProtocols with more projects than Bitcoin\nThe largest protocol, Http, which all website developers use, has 291,882 projects on Github today. Wifi is another extremely common protocol but only has 14,889 projects listed while Bluetooth technology has 13,624. Since Bitcoin currently has 10,055 projects and is climbing, it could surpass Bluetooth this year.\nProtocols with fewer projects than Bitcoin\nBitcoin has already surpassed so many other popular protocols. For instance, FTP, the old standard for uploading files from desktops to any servers, has 8,657 projects on Github today while Secure Socket Layer (SSL), used for standard website communication, only has 7,129 projects.\nVPNs have 4,036 open source projects, which include all reputable VPN service providers. SMTP mail server projects total 3,693, and surprisingly, the basic protocol of the internet itself, TCP/IP, only has 1,861 projects on Github currently.\nTop Money Protocols\nBitcoin is already the most popular protocol for money over the internet. The entire category of cryptocurrency, excluding Bitcoin, has 2,147 projects running today. Meanwhile, Paypal and Visa only have 3,904 and 1,672 open source projects respectively, since at least some of their code is closed source.\nIn other categories of protocols, home automation is one of the largest niche markets to compete with Bitcoin, currently having 5,161 projects. Bittorrent has 1,940 projects while the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) has 777.\nMost Popular Projects Using Bitcoin\nThe vast number of complementary projects to Bitcoin on Github represents the greater Bitcoin ecosystem. They include everything from wallets to code libraries to exchanges and even bitcoin trading bots. Many reputable companies like Bitpay and Blockchain place the code for their products on Github to help create transparency and build confidence among their customers.\nProjects are also ranked by popularity on Github. Other than Bitcoin’s code libraries and other versions of the Bitcoin code itself, the most popular Bitcoin projects include Zeronet, the Brave Browser, a Bittorrent/Github fusion called Gittorrent, Andreas Antonopoulos’ book entitled “Mastering Bitcoin”, Bitpay’s operating system called Bitcore, a trading bot called Gekko, the Electrum wallet, an Arbitrage trading bot, and the classic CPUMiner software.\nWhat do you think of the number of Bitcoin projects on Github?

There have been a few changes since the 7th creditors’ meeting in regards to the “List of Assets and Balance Sheet,” as well as the holdings held by the bankrupt entity.       \n“The status of the bankruptcy estate, based on the investigation conducted up to the time of preparation of this Report, is as shown in the List of Assets and the Balance Sheet, and the balance in the account that I have secured as of March 7, 2017, is JPY 1,030,895,045, i.e., a decrease of approximately JPY 23,500,000 from the time of the 7th creditors’ meeting,” explains the bankruptcy trustee. “However, since the investigation of the status of the holdings of BTC is still on-going, the List of Assets and the Balance Sheet does not contain BTC held by the bankrupt entity.”\nKobayashi reveals the amount of bitcoin held by the bankruptcy estate is currently 202,185.36428254BTC. The trustee also states the court is still investigating the existence of additional bitcoins owned by the bankrupt organization and if more funds are found they will be moved to an address managed by Kobayashi.\nIn addition, Kobayashi details the number of claims accepted since the last creditors’ meeting. So far 24,750 claims have been filed, and the trustee has approved claims that total JPY 45,609,593,503. Since the last meeting, 81 additional claims have been approved, and Kobayashi also has retracted his objections against 19 filed claims. The latest creditors’ meeting report reveals all of the Mt Gox claims have been approved or rejected by Kobayashi.\nThe Disappearance of Mt Gox Bitcoin Holdings and Pending Distribution of Claims \nMt Gox bankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi.\nThe most revealing aspect of the latest creditors’ meeting is the large sums of bitcoin that Mt Gox had allegedly possessed but have since disappeared. Kobayashi says the court is conducting investigations concerning this matter and if funds have disappeared the investigation will be delegated to third parties such as Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Reex Accounting Firm, and a firm called Payward. Furthermore, the court is working with the Tokyo officials who had arrested the former Mt Gox CEO, Mark Karpeles. The Mt Gox founder was prosecuted for tampering with electromagnetic records and suspicion of corporate embezzlement. \n“I have been providing and will continue to provide the police with cooperation as much as possible,” details Kobayashi. “In connection with the police investigation, the careful treatment of information relating to the investigation is now needed.”\nThe Mt Gox trustee explains he believes it will still be difficult to understand “the full picture” of all the missing bitcoins. However, Kobayashi plans to continue the investigations as much as possible. “We are planning to disclose the results of the aforesaid investigation at the appropriate time, in the appropriate manner and with the appropriate content, taking into account concerns of privacy,” the trustee adds.\n\n“Now that all bankruptcy claims have been accepted or rejected, henceforth, I wish to proceed to the distribution process as soon as possible,” concludes the 18-page trustees’ report. “At present, the possibility of carrying out a distribution and the timing and method thereof, has not yet been determined. — I will continue to consider whether, in the case where a distribution is possible, a distribution will be made by way of distributing BTC.”\n\nWhat do you think about the latest Mt Gox creditors’ meeting?

    "text": "\n Today, all of the three major Chinese exchanges – OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC – announced that they will postpone the resuming of bitcoin withdrawals. All three of them have recently been inspected by the Central bank of China (PBoC).\nIn almost identical announcements the exchanges stated they’ve actively been developing and upgrading their systems over the past month, including statements that they’re trying to “research the relevant details of the policy, and learn from regulatory experience from other countries, and discuss with industry counterparts to explore the development of these new industry standards.”\nIn all three announcements the exchanges said that “once approved by the regulating departments, we will resume bitcoin withdrawal services.” Huobi also stressed that “they have been making efforts to ensure the healthy development of cryptocurrencies, under the premise of compliance.”\n“Bitcoin exchange platforms shall not violate the national AML”\nThe exchange CHBTC also announced the same content as OKCoin, Huobi and BTCChina towards its customers. Here’s how Huobi’s announcement was worded;\n“Dear Users:\nAccording to the regulation departments’ (request) “Bitcoin exchange platforms shall not violate the national AML, foreign currency management and payment settlement laws and regulations”, Huobi has been actively developing and upgrading our system in this month, according to the relevant details of the policy, and learn from regulatory experience from other countries, and discuss with industry counterparts to explore the development of the industry standards. Once approved by the regulate departments, we will resume bitcoin withdraw service. Please pay attention to the official announcement of our website.”\nThis piece of news follows earlier announcements from exchanges in China regarding new ways of verification and new rules around futures and margin trading.\nMeanwhile, a smaller Chinese exchange called Coinnice announced it will resume withdrawals shortly, apparently trying to gain more business while the “big three” bleed.\nThe “Lianghui” takes place in China March 9-16 and is one of the most important political events in China. It is well known that the Chinese government prefer to ensure utmost “social stability” during this event.

    "text": "\n The lone star state of Texas has always been well-known for its stance on constitutional rights. On March 2, State Representative Matt Schaefer submitted a proposal to revise the state’s constitution to say that virtual currencies like bitcoin are mediums of exchange that “no government shall prohibit”.\nTexas Lawmaker Says ‘No Government Shall Encumber the Ownership of Bitcoin’\nThe Texas lawmaker wants it to be known that the use of digital currencies is a citizen’s fundamental right. The recently submitted Texas House Joint Resolution 89 proposes to change Article I of the state’s constitution which says that people have the right to use a variety of mediums of exchange. Just as the state of Texas vehemently opposes government interference with gun rights, the amendment would protect currencies like bitcoin in this fashion. Resolution 89 states:\n\nArticle I, Texas Constitution, is amended by adding…the right of the people to own, hold, and use a mutually agreed upon medium of exchange, including cash, coin, bullion, digital currency, or scrip when trading and contracting for goods and services shall not be infringed. No government shall prohibit or encumber the ownership or holding of any form or amount of money or other currency.\n\n‘I Don’t Recall Asking Permission from Anyone to Use Bitcoin’\nCryptocurrency use has certainly increased in certain parts of Texas over the years with many proponents and companies based in the area. For instance, Texas is home to digital currency companies such as Factom, Stash Incorporated, Coinvault, Techendeavors, and the radio broadcast, the Crypto Show. The state of Texas is also home to 48 bitcoin automated tellers and many meetup groups which take place in Dallas, Austin, and Houston. Furthermore, there are many unique merchants in Texas that accept the currency as well, including the Capital Coin & Bullion and Central Texas Gunworks.\nBitcoin.com chatted with the Austin-based Crypto Show host, Dan Sessoms, who explains his opinion of the proposed constitutional amendment. Sessoms tells Bitcoin.com: “I don’t know that bitcoin or any other crypto is more popular in Texas than other states. It does seem to be popular in Austin though. I would attribute that to Austin being a major Tech hub”.\nThe Crypto Show host adds: “The recent news of adding Bitcoin to a constitutional amendment in Texas is somewhat encouraging, but I don’t recall ever asking permission from anyone to use Bitcoin. There have been several politicians in the past that have ‘elected’ to accept bitcoin as a donation option for their campaign, but let’s face it, that was pure greed, and those politicians wouldn’t lift a finger to help Bitcoin. Governor Greg Abbot accepted bitcoin, but it’s unlikely he’ll support this amendment. This is a guy who has sworn that marijuana legalization will not happen on his watch. Real forward-thinking guy. I guess it would be nice see a constitutional amendment, but I won’t be heartbroken if it doesn’t happen”.\nThe proposed amendment will be submitted to voters in November 2017.\nWhat do you think about Texas amending the state’s constitution to protect bitcoin users?

Almost 240 days later and 59 comments received, the SEC finally made a decision. In its order, after recapping the filing history, the Commission wrote:\n\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act, that the proposed rule change (SR-BatsBZX-2016-30), as modified by Amendments No. 1 and 2, be, and it hereby is, disapproved.\n\nRead about the reasons for the SEC’s rejection here.\nBitcoin Will Be Ok\nBitcoin’s price has been on a wild ride today as the market anticipates the ETF decision. While many in the Bitcoin community were hopeful of a positive outcome, analysts had already expected the approval of a Bitcoin ETF to be unlikely. Needham & Company, for example, predicted a less than 25 percent chance of it happening.\nLast month, the firm published an in-depth analysis on Bitcoin ETFs which also discussed the effects on bitcoin’s price should the SEC reject the proposed rule change. Author Spencer Bogart, who previously expected a “highly limited” downside back in January, revised his view and wrote that: “we think downside risks is greater than it was only a few weeks ago”. His stated reasons were that “there’s been a significant run-up in price, the premium on GBTC has fallen substantially, the ETF has seen a significant increase in media attention, and some segments of the market appear to be speculating in favor of approval”.\nDespite downside risks, Bogart concludes that:\n\nWe think the vast majority of owners will continue holding bitcoin regardless of the SEC’s decision and would likely welcome the opportunity to buy at a lower price – thus providing price support.\n\nThis is the first time the SEC has made a decision on a proposed rule change to list and trade a Bitcoin ETF.

The company claims the protocol can enable billions of Bitcoin users to make payments over Lumino’s off-chain payment network.\nAlso read: How the Hyped Lumino Whitepaper Details Protocol for Scaling Bitcoin \n\nAccording to today’s announcement, the experimental technology will allow for scaling RSK Lab’s Bitcoin-enhancing infrastructure to reach levels of “up to 2,000 on-chain tps” (a 667x improvement over the current max tps) “and more than 20,000 off-chain tps” when the full sidechain solution is complete.\nIf all goes according to plan, that would let Bitcoin process 7,330 times the number of transactions that it handles now, without raising fees. According to the RSK team, “this puts RSK on a level closer to traditional financial institutions, and it can enable fair access to financial services for the 50% of the global population currently outside the financial system”.\nBitcoin.com spoke with Sergio Demián Lerner, RSK Labs’ Chief Scientist, about Bitcoin scaling solutions to find out exactly how RSK Labs’ solutions and other projects can work together.\nThe Path to a Billion Users\nBitcoin.com (BC): Could you explain exactly what the differences are between Lumino and the LTCP protocol?\nSergio Lerner\nSergio Lerner (SL): Lumino is a hub-and-spoke network that uses off-chain payments similar to the Lightning Network (with some minor enhancements). However, Lumino relies on the LTCP protocol (Lumino Transaction Compression Protocol) as an underlying protocol layer. This protocol layer radically increases the number of settlements and payment channel top-ups that on-chain transactions can handle.\nCompression is achieved by a “delta” method, with additional compression by signature aggregation. LTCP can actually create “on-chain” payment channels for frequent topping-up and settling of off-chain channels.\nIf an on-chain payment channel is heavily used, it’s possible that an on-chain transaction consumes as low as 5 bytes of blockchain space. The benefits are huge:\n\nWe expect Lumino running over LTCP over RSK over Bitcoin to be able to serve one billion people in the upcoming years. Almost the number of unbanked people in the world.\n\nComplementary Scaling Proposals\nBC: If Segwit is implemented in Bitcoin first, does that mean Lumino would offer an average of 210 on-chain tps?\nSL: Segwit and Lumino are two complementary scaling proposals. Segwit scales using a trick to soft-fork an increase of capacity, instead of hard-forking it. It’s not a scaling solution only: Segwit brings other improvements. I will support both scaling via Segwit and via other means. All things equal, LTCP scales more because the account-based ledger model uses 3 times smaller transactions, and because LTCP removes old signature data, recovering almost 64% additional space. Therefore:\n\nLTCP scales Bitcoin 8.3 times, while Segwit only 1.8 times.\n\nBC: How does Lumino compare to the Lightning Network?\nSL: If we compare the designs of Lumino over LTCP over Bitcoin (without RSK) and the Lightning Network over Segwit over Bitcoin, Lumino is clearly a much more powerful and elegant solution. However, a Lumino/LTCP soft-fork has not been implemented, while I understand that the Lightning network has been fully implemented, so:\n\nI will support the Lightning Network until any better solution is at hand.\n\nBC: Could Lightning work alongside Lumino, scaling Bitcoin the rest of the way to mainstream-level tps?\nSL: Lumino IS a lightning-like network, so the question doesn’t make sense. Both Lumino and the Lightning-network allow millions of payments per second. The problem is how many active users can be served, not the actual tps, because most transactions are sent end to end, not broadcast.\nAccording to Lerner;\n“The Lumino/LTCP/RSK/Bitcoin combo can serve 1 billion users (approximately)\nThe Lumino/LTCP/Bitcoin combo can serve 50 million users (approximately)\nThe Lightning/Segwit/Bitcoin combo can serve 3 million users (approximately)\nThe Lightning/Bitcoin combo can serve 1 million users (approximately)”\n\nOther Scaling Solutions\nBC: Are there any other solutions out there that could fill in the gap for the other 6.3 billion?\nSL: It’s only a matter of time: eventually a decentralized system would be able to serve 6.3 billion users. Meanwhile, centralized systems like Coinbase or Xapo can make payments between their own users as simple as updating their own private ledger records.\nBC: Some scaling solutions sound like they would compete with each other. For instance, once RSK Lab’s sidechain solution is deployed, would Blockstream’s sidechain product be a competitor to it, or are they complementary?\nSL: I think they would be complementary. At this point is too early to pick a winner: we must explore all paths to scalability and let the future users decide. We must learn from each success and failure.\nSidechains Optional\nBC: Does Lumino use a sidechain and for what purpose?\nSL: The LTCP paper focuses on using Lumino over LTCP over the RSK sidechain over Bitcoin, because RSK allows very fast block confirmations, and because LTCP can be easily implemented over an account-based ledger, such as RSK. Reaching a consensus over a Bitcoin soft-fork can be extremely hard, while improving Bitcoin by using a sidechain does not require one to ask permission to anyone, nor can sidechain compromise Bitcoin security in any way.\n\nBeing a sidechain, RSK is not bound to the current block size status quo. We can create larger blocks (or more frequent smaller blocks). RSK can make Bitcoin scale without compromising Bitcoin decentralization, if the RSK node resource consumption is kept low (even if it’s higher than Bitcoin). We expect a large number of Bitcoin users to participate.\n\nHowever, Lumino and the LTCP can also be implemented directly as a Bitcoin soft-fork, which allows an increase of number of transactions per second in Bitcoin to 100 tps or more (the exact figure depends on the usage patterns), using extension blocks. Also, a Lumino/LTCP soft-fork would allow approximately 50 million users to be part of the Lumino/Bitcoin network, but as a comparison, the Lumino/RSK combo can reach one billion people.\nBC: In a tweet a few weeks ago, you said: “I know that Bitcoin can scale to serve 400 million users and I won’t need to ask permission to anyone to scale it.” Is deploying Lumino as a soft fork still permissionless?\nSL: I was referring to Lumino over RSK: when you create a sidechain, you don’t have to ask permission from anyone. People will use it or not, but you can deploy it yourself. Soft forks do require 51% of the miners to enforce the soft fork rules.\nIn Response to Lumino’s Critics\nBC: The LTCP paper appears to say that Lumino will use the OP_RETURN field in Bitcoin transactions, and therefore not allow for multisignature transactions, nor business use of Bitcoin for blockchain timestamping, is that correct?\nSL: LTCP plus an extension to the smart contract signature verification system enable multisignature transactions. I speak about this extension in the MIT presentation that is online. There is no limitation.\n\nWhat do you think of RSK Labs’ scaling plans for Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "text": "\n A new report from a British defense and security think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), reveals that reports of terrorism financed through Bitcoin are greatly exaggerated.\nAlso Read: Mainstream Media Columnist Says SEC Should Reject Bitcoin ETF\n‘Treating Cryptocurrencies as an Exceptional Threat is a Misleading Impression’\nRUSI consultant David Carlisle said that there is a lot of attention given to the possibility of bitcoin being used as a terrorist financing tool but “overreaction could stifle an important new financial technology”. He noted that there are very few instances where cryptocurrencies have been used for terrorism. However, the prospect of utilizing virtual currencies for terrorist activity has produced a significant response from many governments. Believing the response to be sensationalized, he states that:\n\nTreating cryptocurrencies as an exceptional threat creates the misleading impression that more conventional financial products are not already equally, or more, vulnerable to terrorist exploitation.\n\nThe RUSI contributor says that it is not yet clear whether cryptocurrencies will be used in terrorist financing. At the moment, Carlisle explains that terrorists already have a vast array of existing “financing streams, which show little sign of drying up”. Additionally, another RUSI report reveals that lone actors and small cell terrorists are using financial services such as student loans, payday loans, welfare benefits, and cash.\nTraditional Financial Services are Harder to Track than Bitcoin \nFurthermore, law enforcement has a difficult time investigating terrorists using traditional mediums of exchange. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, for example, are not entirely anonymous, as most blockchains are openly available to the public, explains Carlisle.\n“Cryptocurrencies are also not necessarily impenetrable fortresses of secrecy — With bitcoin, which is by far the most widely used cryptocurrency and relies on a public ledger — the blockchain — to record transactions, law enforcement agencies have a number of methods for uncovering illicit activity”, Carlisle’s report details.\n‘Countries Should Pursue a Sensible Approach’\nCarlisle believes that cryptocurrencies are an innovative force and “overreaction and panic in this early stage in cryptocurrencies’ history would be misguided”. The report explains that Bitcoin could reduce the costs typically found at traditional payment providers and offer a better form of financial inclusion to citizens worldwide. The RUSI report states: “Virtual currencies, therefore, offer governments a test case in harnessing the promise of technological innovation while also managing financial crime risks that are still only taking shape”.\n“Countries should pursue a sensible approach — Countries should take the time to monitor and assess the effectiveness of new regulation before rushing into further action”, Carlisle concludes in his paper.\nWhat do you think about governments overreacting towards Bitcoin and terrorist financing?

    "text": "\n Facebook, Twitter, the New York Times and…Localbitcoins. In China, they’re all inaccessible behind the ‘great firewall’, which refers to internet censorship in the so-called ‘red dragon’. Since the introduction of revamped regulatory measures by most Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, bitcoin trading seems to have, at least in part, shifted to over the counter markets; in particularly, Localbitcoins.\nChinese bitcoin exchanges introduced new ‘know your customer’ measures and suspended withdrawals indefinitely last month ahead of new People’s Bank of China (PBoC) guidelines. This has seemingly led to increased volume on over-the-counter markets like Localbitcoins, which facilitates trades in local currency across the globe.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Transaction Volumes Playing Increased Role Amid China Shakeup\nIncreasing Bitcoin Volume on Localbitcoins in China\n\nBitcoin analytics website Coin.dance shows transactions as high as $36 million Chinese yuan over the week ending February 18.\nThat total had exploded to nearly 60 million yuan by last week. The chart, to be sure, also reflects an increasing bitcoin price and an inflating yuan. Nevertheless, increasing bitcoin prices don’t seem to keep investors away from the digital currency. As late as early February 2017, the total trades on the OTC bitcoin website stood below 14,000,000 yuan.\n\nAccording to the Community Manager for the Finland-based company Localbitcoins, who goes by ‘Max’, transactions on the bitcoin trading platform in China have been done mostly using VPNs.\n“We’re already technically blocked in China as our site uses, among other things, Google’s re-captcha system,” according to Max on Reddit. “As all Google resources are blocked in China you can’t log in to our site from mainland China unless you use a VPN.”\nFinding a trustworthy VPN might be difficult in China, which banned all unauthorized VPNs earlier this year.\nChina’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology stated ahead of the bans, “China’s internet connection service market…has signs of ­disordered development that ­require urgent regulation and governance.”\nIt added that new regulations will “strengthen cyberspace information security management.”\nLocalbitcoins: One of the First Places Individuals Could Trade Bitcoins Online\nLocalbitcoins is available virtually everywhere, and facilitates a variety of trades, including in-person trades between people who want bitcoins, and those who wish to sell them.\nThe vast majority of trades on the site occur with different types of bank-to-bank transfers, but also high risk payments, such as with gift cards. The site has experienced steady growth since it was introduced in 2012, founder Jeremias Kangas recently told Bitcoin.com.\n“[Localbitcoins] grows at quite steady, predictable pace,” Mr. Kangas said. “In some countries where inflation is high with big differences in currency exchange rates – like Nigeria, Venezuela and others – the rate at which bitcoins are exchanged can be quite different from what the official rates into fiat are. So, bitcoin might be a more and more relevant tool to get the actual value of a specific currency in the future.”\nDespite ongoing fluctuations in the Chinese bitcoin market, bitcoin prices there have increased this week, sitting at more than 8,000 CNY on all main exchanges.\n\nWhat do you think about Chinese interest in Localbitcoins?

    "text": "\n On March 10 after the closing of the New York Stock Exchange, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected the rule change for the Bitcoin ETF due to regulatory concerns. Following the announcement, the price per bitcoin dropped to a low of US$1,020. The price has since rebounded to the $1,180 mark, at the time of writing.\nAlso read: SEC Rejects Rule Change for Bitcoin ETF\nBitcoin Price Dives Minutes After ETF Ruling\nBitcoin markets took a sharp dive after the SEC announcement, losing 15 percent of its price value in a matter of minutes. During the day the price had climbed to a new all-time high for a short period as people waited for the decision from the U.S. regulatory agency. However, as soon as the decision was made the decline started creating significant volatility and slow exchanges. The bitcoin exchange Coinbase suffered from an outage during the event but camed back online shortly after the initial price drop.\nMost of the bitcoin community across forums and social media seemed to brush the news off quickly. Some even welcomed the rejection with open arms saying they didn’t want the ETF approved.\n\nSome Expect ‘Continued Volatility and High Volume’\nMany bitcoin proponents said the price was expected to be volatile following the announcement either way. “The markets are digesting the information at the moment – we expect continued volatility and high volume,” explains the cryptocurrency data website Crypto Compare founder Charles Hayter, detailing his opinion of the situation;\n“The SEC does not like Bitcoin being unchained from all regulation, and this move is, in essence, a form of consumer protection,” Hayter explained.\n‘Large Players Sitting on the Sidelines’\nPetar Zivkovski, Chief operating officer of the bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub spoke with Bitcoin.com and gave us Whaleclub’s opinion of bitcoin markets going forward.\n“We expect a substantial decrease in volatility going forward, both in selling and buying BTC. Most of the run upwards from the $750 level was powered by rumors and speculation surrounding the Coin ETF,” Zivkovski told Bitcoin.com.\n\nThat event is now resolved and there is hence less uncertainty in the market, which translates to less volatility. Large players have exited bitcoin for now and are sitting on the sidelines waiting for another bullish or bearish catalyst. Many fear bitcoin’s scalability issues will take center stage again, which could put negative pressure on price. — We can expect a relatively flat or slightly declining market until then.\n\nThe price seems to have consolidated from the initial shock as markets have tamed and bitcoin’s price rejuvenates. The SEC staff can still approve a bitcoin ETF after more regulation and oversight is considered. Bitcoin proponents who supported the ETF still seem optimistic that a digital currency fund could come to fruition in the future, and some could care less.\nWhat do you think about the market reaction to the ETF decision?

    "text": "\n As the Bitcoin network experiences transaction congestion and higher fees many people have considered alternatives to avoid these issues. During transaction traffic peaks, a few cryptocurrency supporters have recommended using altcoins to save money from bitcoin miner fees and speed up settlement times. However, using an altcoin to save a few cents on a transaction may be more of a hassle than you think.\nAlso read: Creating Altcoins is Easy, Maintaining One is Not\nThe Cost, Time, and Risks Associated With Using Altcoins to Speed Up Settlement \nLately, there have been a lot of complaints towards the rising fee market and slow confirmation times when it comes to sending a bitcoin transaction. Some say it’s best to patiently wait for Bitcoin developers to implement scaling solutions, but no one knows when this will happen. Now some people are advocating the use of an altcoin to conduct faster transactions with lower fees. But is it worth it? \nExchanging Bitcoin for an Alternative Token\nIn order to use an altcoin, you have to obtain the digital currency from an exchange. Exchanges will trade you an alternative digital currency, but most (not all) require bitcoin for the trade. This means you still have to use the bitcoin network to conduct a transaction, which will require a miner fee and wait time. You also have to sign up to use the exchange, which takes time and can include a verification process. There are platforms like Shapeshift that don’t require a registration process, but for a vast majority of exchanges, the procedure is mandatory.\nWhile using a third party exchange users also expose themselves to the risks of holding funds on a platform that could be compromised at any moment. The list of dead altcoin exchanges like Mintpal and Cryptsy have proved user funds can disappear in the blink of an eye without warning. All that aside, swapping bitcoin for an altcoin will still incur a bitcoin miner fee, the altcoin’s miner fee, and also a fee to execute the trade within the exchange. Furthermore, spreads can be quite different across many altcoin exchanges so a person may lose more money waiting on a buy order to fulfill their sell request.\nAltcoin Volatility  \nAnother reason against using an altcoin for settlement over bitcoin is volatility concerns. Over the past eight years, bitcoin volatility has decreased significantly. However the same cannot be said for the hundreds of nascent alternative cryptocurrencies in existence. Bitcoin has far less market volatility than any altcoin, and this attribute continues to get better. This past December Bitcoin proponent and analyst Willy Woo explained in great detail why bitcoin is less volatile than altcoins. Furthermore, Woo has suggested that bitcoin volatility will match major fiat currencies in two years. “I established that Bitcoin is well on the path to being the most stable currency in the world,” explains Woo.\nUsing an altcoin to save money could lead to bigger losses if the transactions are not settled quickly. Moreover, leaving a secondary purse of altcoins for spending money may be even more disastrous as price swings can definitely affect a person’s purchasing power. Altcoin volatility can be a huge risk to pay in contrast to paying higher bitcoin transaction fees.\n“Bitcoin’s peak volatility is reducing steadily and will enter the realms of fiat currency (below 5.5%) by around July 2019,” explains Woo. Infrastructure and Merchants\n\nBitcoin’s network effect runs deep and it has the largest infrastructure compared to every other altcoin. Merchant acceptance for altcoins is very low compared to the 100,000 plus merchants worldwide who accept bitcoin. So using an altcoin to save money is not so convenient as there are very few places that accept other digital currencies. Bitpay’s merchant services has no altcoin support alongside a great majority of global payment processors and debit cards that only utilize bitcoin.\nAdditionally, in order to hold an altcoin using a secondary spending purse rather than leaving the funds on a vulnerable exchange, users have to use the token’s limited infrastructure. A great majority of altcoins have very little infrastructure. A person may have to download the altcoin’s QT client because there are very few alternative light wallets. Furthermore, many of the light client wallets for altcoins may not be reputable or vetted enough which could easily lead to a loss of funds.\nAltcoin Blockchain Issues\nAltcoins can also suffer from the same issues bitcoin contends with, such as slow confirmation times and network attacks. For instance, a few months ago an attacker caused a lot of difficulty for users of the Ethereum network. Throughout the fall months of 2016, the Ethereum network had suffered through many computational DDoS attacks. This caused problems with Ethereum’s GETH client and forced some users to switch to the Parity client. Furthermore, during all of this transactions took hours and even days to process across the network.\nBack in 2014, the Dash (formally Darkcoin) community suffered from an emergency fork while trying to implement its new masternode system in a series of forks. During the event, some users found their wallet clients were unable to sync, and popular altcoin exchanges froze Dash deposits and withdrawals. Dash holders suffered a significant loss from market volatility during the emergency fork. The cryptocurrency reached a record high of $15 per Dash prior to the problems and subsequently fell to a low of $5 over the next few months.\nBitcoin Has Its Problems, but Altcoins Seem to Have Far More\nSaving money using an altcoin instead of bitcoin to avoid higher miner fees may not be in people’s best interest. Altcoins may be useful for other niche applications like anonymity services, but to save a few cents it may not be worth it. The fact is, there are far more risks involved with opting to use an altcoin for settlement. In many ways, bitcoin’s benefits still eclipse alternative currencies, even with higher fees and slower confirmation times.\n However, if the Bitcoin network does not scale and the fee market continues to rise rapidly then an exodus to an altcoin could very well happen.\nDo you think using altcoins can help with saving fees and speeding up settlement time? Or do you agree there is a lot more risk involved with that idea? Let us know what you think in the comments below.  Images courtesy of Bitcoin.com, Pixabay, and Woobull.com.

    "text": "\n On Friday, Bitcoin.com reported on the ruling by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejecting Bats BZX Exchange’s proposed rule change to list and trade Coin ETF. In this article, we examine the reasoning behind the SEC’s decision and the Bitcoin community’s reactions.\nAlso read: SEC Rejects Rule Change for Bitcoin ETF \nReasons for SEC’s Rejection\nThe SEC explained how the proposed rule change was disapproved because the proposal was not consistent with “Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest”.\nIn order to be consistent with the Exchange Act, the SEC explained that:\n\nBats BZX Exchange must “have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading” bitcoin or its derivatives.\nBitcoin markets must be regulated.\n\nHowever, Friday’s Order states that:\n\nThe Commission believes that the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated.\n\nSince bitcoin markets are largely unregulated, the SEC concludes that Bats BZX Exchange does not have and would not be able to have the type of surveillance-sharing agreement which all other SEC-approved commodity-trust ETPs (exchange-traded-products) have.\nThe Commission claims that these agreements help address “concerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices in this market”. Without them, the proposal would not be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act.\n‘Inconsequential’ Comment Letters\nAccording to the Commission, 59 comment letters were received on this proposed rule change as of March 8. The 38-page Order dedicates 15 pages to discussions of comments received by the SEC, grouped into comments regarding; the worldwide market for bitcoin, the Gemini exchange, and the derivatives markets for bitcoin.\nMark T. Williams\nOne commenter, Mark T. Williams, otherwise known as “Professor Bitcorn” in the Bitcoin community, is a member of the Boston University faculty specializing in banking, capital markets and commodity trading risk. The professor is infamous for publicly predicting in late 2013 that Bitcoin will fail and crash to below $10 by June 2014. He has since doubled-down on his claim and stands by his opinion today that the Bitcoin ‘bubble’ will indeed deflate eventually, and insists that he will be vindicated.\nFor some reason, the Commission cited Williams eight times in its ruling, so his comments stood out among others. He told the SEC that “There are several fundamental flaws that make Bitcoin a dangerous asset class to force into an ETF structure”. He also tried to convince the Commission to disapprove the ETF, citing the problems of “shallow trade volume, extreme hoarding, low liquidity, hyper price volatility, a global web of unregulated bucket shop exchanges, high bankruptcy risk and oversized exposure to trading in countries where there is no regulatory oversight, such as China”.\nHowever, the Commission wrote that: “Ultimately, however, comments on these topics do not bear on the basis for the Commission’s decision to disapprove the proposal”.\nReactions from the Community\nThe Bitcoin community went wild on social media after the decision. The stated reasons for disapproving the proposed rule change for Coin ETF did not resonate well with the community. Not all were disappointed by the outcome, however.\nFamous speaker Andreas Antonopoulos tweeted: “The ETF was denied because bitcoin can’t be regulated, can’t be surveilled. Feature, not bug”. Another of his tweets says:\n\nBitgo CTO Ben Davenport also took to Twitter with his interpretation of the event. “SEC: bitcoin must be traded on regulated markets to be traded on regulated markets”, he tweeted.\nSenior Advisor at MIT Media Lab, Michael Casey, tweeted: “SEC rejection of #Bitcoin ETF means the space remains interesting. For now, BTC stays in the zone of disobedience. Where innovation happens”.\nThere is Still Hope for Future Bitcoin ETFs\nWhile the SEC rejected the proposed rule change for Coin ETF, it is not all hopeless for other Bitcoin ETFs. The Commission wrote:\n\nBitcoin is still in the relatively early stages of its development and that, over time, regulated bitcoin-related markets of significant size may develop. Should such markets develop, the Commission could consider whether a Bitcoin ETP would, based on the facts and circumstances then presented, be consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act.\n\nThe next Bitcoin ETF up for consideration by the Commission is Solidx Bitcoin Trust whose deadline is March 30. The third one in line is Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust whose deadline is sometime in October.\nWhat do you think of the SEC’s reasons for disapproving the proposed rule change for Coin ETF?

    "text": "\n More information on the developments in China have been coming out recently, concerning the new regulations of Chinese bitcoin exchanges. On March 9th, Wu Xiaolin, the former deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and congresswoman for the National People’s Congress, told a local reporter the central bank should be responsible for these types of bitcoin trading platforms.\nAlso read: A Better Scaling Solution Than Segwit? Sergio Says So\nChinese Congresswoman Says ‘Bitcoin Is a Successful Application of Blockchain Technology’\nAccording to Wu Xiaolin, the PBOC should be in charge of regulating bitcoin exchanges because the businesses involve certain aspects of anti-money laundering (AML), foreign currency management, and payment settlement. Wu explains the recent inspections were needed, so bitcoin is not a tool used for money laundering purposes. The congresswoman also states she hopes the bitcoin exchanges within the country are compliant with the new regulatory policies. However, she expressed bitcoin exchanges have so far been very cooperative and have carried out self-examinations. \n“Bitcoin is a relatively successful application of blockchain technology,” details the translated commentary from congresswoman Wu Xiaolin. “Now different governments and regulators have different options on bitcoin. In China, we defined it as a digital asset. There are other countries considering it as a decentralized currency without legal compensation characteristics.”\nThe Central Bank Encourages the Development of Financial Technology\nWu has spoken about bitcoin many times in the past once stating the digital currency should be regulated but not banned. Moreover, the congresswoman has said the existence of bitcoin and government issued virtual currencies can coexist. Wu and some of her colleagues seem to have little issues with bitcoin as long as it is monitored.    \nMeanwhile, the PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan has also made recent statements concerning China’s vision towards financial technology.\n“The central bank highly encourages the development of financial technology,” explains Xiaochuan. “Digital currency, blockchain, and other technologies will have an unpredictable impact. In the development process, the problems encountered needs to be regulated.”\nU.S. State Department is Monitoring China’s Regulatory Efforts Towards International AML Standards\nAlongside the recent PBOC inspections, the U.S. State Department released a report written by the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INLEA) concerning China and many other countries’ financial regulation enforcement strategies. The INLEA report gives a very detailed overview of the recent PBOC regulatory crackdown on the Chinese financial sector. The statements made seems to imply the U.S. government hopes China continues to make improvements to its AML legal and regulatory framework towards underground financial systems and digital currencies.\n“China should cooperate with international law enforcement to investigate how indigenous Chinese underground financial systems, virtual currencies, and trade-based value transfer are used for illicit outbound transfers, and to receive inbound remittances and criminal proceeds,” the INLEA report concludes.\nChinese regulators, politicians, and PBOC executives are indeed applying great attention to financial regulation enforcement with bitcoin businesses and many other types of monetary exchange operations.\nWhat do you think about the recent PBOC crackdown to better enforce regulations?

    "title": " A new academic paper, entitled “Bitcoin: Order without Law in the Digital Age”, explores the “fundamental structure” of Bitcoin.",
    "text": "\n A new academic paper, entitled “Bitcoin: Order without Law in the Digital Age”, explores the “fundamental structure” of Bitcoin. The paper seeks to show “how its decentralized order contrasts with currency regimes”. Highlighting how technology has changed our lives, the paper notes how – with the advent of Bitcoin – even modern currency is not exempt from the steady march of technological progress. \nAlso Read: Could Bitcoin Affect Emerging Market Monetary Policy? \nThe paper highlights how bitcoin can “perform the functions of currencies without the traditional law of currency”. The paper also adds that Bitcoin’s global and distributed approach to order without law, as opposed to more spatially-close communities, is novel. “Order without some forms of law is nothing new”, the paper reads. “But previously most forms of order without law depended on relatively close-knit communities”. \nTechnology Changes Central Bank Money\n\n“Software is eating away even a function as basic as currency”, concludes the paper. “The digital revolution is evolving from a phenomenon that changed the way we communicate, to an era that is producing innovations that disrupt many of our preconceived notions of law and governance”.\nThe paper, penned by John O. McGinnis and Kyle Roche, does not suggest that bitcoin will replace the US dollar, but that the digital currency could change people’s ways of life.\n“Bitcoin’s sustained success and growth is proof that it is changing the way individuals and societies exchange value”, the paper argues. Bitcoin is significant for both its own order without currency law and for establishing a platform to help sustain other forms of non-legal order, according to the paper.\nMore Resistant to State Control\nVenezuela has slowly transformed into a poster child for oppression against Bitcoiners.\n“Bitcoin represents a potential third currency regime far more resistant to state control, because it is minted in no physical place, operates under encryption, and places a numerical ceiling on the number that can be created”, according to the paper’s abstract. “The trust required is not in any government but in the decentralized order of those who verify Bitcoin transactions”. Bitcoin has advantages over other currencies.\n“As the Bitcoin ecosystem continues to grow, its non-legal order can help it climb the rungs of stability created by distrust in government”, state the authors. “Bitcoin’s order without currency law will facilitate other forms of order with less law”.\nThe Internet could provide an example of how technology disrupts longstanding institutions.\n“Like the Internet, Bitcoin is multijurisdictional, and thus one sovereign cannot shut it down”, notes the paper. “Miners can move elsewhere and people can use it elsewhere. Additionally, if Bitcoin proves to be popular and widely used, its advocates will make it difficult for governments to shut down even within personal jurisdictions”.\nCompetition to State Issued Currencies\n\nThe paper surmises that, in certain nations, bitcoin could function as competition to fiat currencies.\n“Central banks have often proven incapable of binding themselves to their redemption promises”, the authors suggest. “Their public law monopoly status gives them immunity from the legal and marketplace sanctions that ordinarily prevent commercial banks from reneging on their commitments”.\nAdditionally, central banks do not need to fear losing customers. Central banks can thus pursue policies that are not in the best interest of the public. Thanks to Bitcoin, citizens who have little trust in their nation’s currency regime are free to consider bitcoin. However, as reported first by Bitcoin.com, hyper-inflationary Venezuela has seen instances of government crackdown on Bitcoin users, lending credence to the claims made in the academic paper.\n“Bitcoin’s greatest advantage over such state-issued currencies is that it has no political master to serve”, the paper reads. “Bitcoin grants an option to citizens of monetarily oppressive regimes to transact in something other than their state-issued currencies. In fact, we are already seeing Bitcoin gaining market share in transactions in nations such as Cyprus, Argentina, and China, where citizens have reason to doubt the value of the national currency”.\nBitcoin, the cyberpunk underground and not the product of legal institutions, is historically unique in this respect.\n“Until recently, there has been no widespread currency that has been the creation of something other than legal regimes”, according to the authors.\nDo you use Bitcoin for political or central bank motivated reasons?

    "title": " The freshly-licensed Coinbase is a bellwether of what to expect from centralized bitcoin exchanges. This is true not only",
    "text": "\n The freshly-licensed Coinbase is a bellwether of what to expect from centralized bitcoin exchanges. This is true not only in the U.S. but wherever regulation forces exchanges to serve the state and crony-banking system from which bitcoin offers escape.\nNo wonder decentralized exchanges, like Localbitcoins, are breaking their own volume records on a weekly basis. The peer to peer exchanges are imperfect. But for the cautious and the informed, they are a return to the privacy and financial freedom that made bitcoin a beacon.\nAlso read: Norwegian Prosecutors Seek 120 Bitcoins in Court Restitutions\nThe Threat Of Coinbase\nLate in February, a Reddit thread on Coinbase erupted. The exchange had implemented a new method to verify identities. The first post in the thread captured the change and the dominant reaction to it.\n\nJust tried to help a friend register an account and they’re demanding access to her webcam?!?! “we will require you to take a photo of yourself with your webcam”….but no law or regulation requires this. I have accounts with 3 brokerage firms, 2 banks, and Gemini, and none have ever demanded access to my computer’s hardware. Coinbase, what are you trying to pull here? Accessing our computer’s hardware is not required by… laws/regulations. What’s your true endgame?\n\nCoinbase’s accelerated ID verification is part of its commitment to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws – two incredibly invasive measures that destroy financial privacy. Coinbase’s new layer of verification uses facial recognition technology to correlate a live real-time face shot from a webcam or smartphone with the image of ID being submitted at the same time by an account applicant or with the data already on file for an account holder. (The process is described with images here.)\nNot everyone seems to be subjected to the increased scrutiny. Perhaps those who appear suspicious. Perhaps they belong to a ‘wrong’ category such as ‘non-American.’ Or Coinbase may be gradually implementing the technology in order to iron out the myriad problems being experienced by users. A Reddit poster with an existing Coinbase account wrote;\n\nI’ve had an account for three months and all of a sudden when I went to but [sic] more Bitcoin I was taken to a page to verify my identity again. I had already done that by uploading my license. This time they made me use my webcam and it took me eight tries because they kept saying it was too blurry.\n\nWhatever the reason and unless there is a considerable downside, Coinbase is unlikely to forgo a process that protects it from government and provides commercially valuable data. The process is more likely to become the norm for centralized exchanges.\nThe Long Path To Your Identity Strip Search\nThe change has been coming for some while. Jumio, an online mobile payments and ID verification company, unveiled its new Face Match feature in September 2013. In March 2014, a Coindesk article announced Jumio’s Bitcoin Identity Security Open Network (BISON) which targeted a client base “of bitcoin exchanges, wallets, and ATM providers worldwide.” The article indicated future data-sharing plans, which may or may not be optional; the description is confusing and gathered data is often shared despite guarantees to the contrary. The article continued, “BISON client businesses will also have access to regularly updated data regarding success rates, failure rates, account openings, transaction failures and fraud attempts within the network…”\nIn November 2016, Biometric Update heralded Jumio’s innovative melding of Face Match with a bitcoin focus; Coinbase was specifically mentioned.\n\nJumio’s Netverify now includes Face Match and ID verification, a three-pronged approach to the…[KYC] process on mobile devices by confirming an identity and the validity of the person presenting the ID….[Coinbase can] ensure the person with the ID matches the identity on the card before approving increased buy/sell limits within the marketplace.\n\nThis February, Netverify Document Verification was publicly unrolled and declared to be the “first web and mobile document verification solution to meet KYC and AML requirements for pertinent account information.” Coinbase implemented the system in that same month, but the exchange does not seem to restrict its application to “increased buy/sell limit” requests.\nCentralized exchanges are becoming unapologetic arms of the state. They are rushing to over-comply with laws that gut the privacy and protection of their customers.\nThe Unbearable Lightness of Peer to Peer\nMy experience in opening a Localbitcoins account stands in sharp contrast. It took me less than two minutes yesterday morning to register. A follow-up email contained a link upon which to click and constituted the only ID verification. Presumably, an anonymous but valid email address would have sufficed. In a February 12, 2017, Bitcoin.com article, Jamie Redman added, “There is an option to upload a state-issued identification card, license, and a phone number. Verifying these IDs does add more trust to the buying and selling process as far as reputation is concerned. However, users can opt out of these verification processes and still conduct trades on the platform.”\nHow does Localbitcoins function? Established in 2012, it is a type of Craigslist that connects individuals within certain regions who wish to sell or to buy bitcoins. Sellers advertise on the website where they state details such as the selling price and the payment methods accepted. Buyers reply and either meet the seller in person with cash or arrange for alternative payment — for example, through Paypal, gift cards, or Western Union. Localbitcoins offers escrow and conflict resolution as well as a feedback mechanism by which traders can be rated.\nAs of August 2016, about 1.35 million members were reportedly registered from 249 countries, and the value of weekly transactions exceeded $14 million.\nLocalbitcoins is not the only peer to peer exchange. Three others often mentioned favorably are Bitquick, Bitsquare, and Wall of Coins.\nConclusion\nEvery way of transferring wealth has risks. Forums on peer to peer trading are rife with tales of scams but, then, so are forums on mainstream exchanges. Coinbase has been accused of arbitrarily closing accounts and of canceling transfers when a change in bitcoin’s price acts to its disadvantage.\nBut the greatest risk is the regulation of bitcoin which peaks when governments, like Venezuela, crackdown with brute force. The greatest threat to financial freedom is the coalition of governments and central banks, both of which need your cooperation and data to function effectively. Centralized bitcoin exchanges are fast becoming a means to gather both. They are fast blurring into banks.\nWhat do you think about centralized exchanges and increased verification practices?

    "text": "\n Over the past week, the exchange rate of one bitcoin has continued to hold above the US$1,200 range, maintaining an average of $1,215-1,235 per BTC. As bitcoin’s price has consolidated, cryptocurrency markets in general have increased in volume significantly. Currently, 24-hour cryptocurrency trading volume now exceeds $1 billion in trades per day reaching a new milestone.\nAlso Read: Dissecting Swisscoin – Another Rising ‘Cryptocurrency’ Blockchain Ponzi\nBitcoin’s Price Stability and Overall Cryptocurrency Trade Volume Increases\nThe price of a bitcoin has been quite stable over the seven-day period since the rejected ETF decision last Friday. Initially, bitcoin markets reacted with a price rise while waiting for the decision on March 10 and after the SEC’s announcement market prices declined. Since then bitcoin’s value has recovered from the downturn and increased in value to a high of $1,260 on March 15. Bitcoin volume has been incredibly high, reaching an average of over $500 million USD worth of volume daily.\n\nOn the peer-to-peer level, bitcoin exchange volumes like Localbitcoins have also reached all-time highs this week. Global Localbitcoins volumes are currently $32 million with countries like China, the U.S., and Canada leading the race. Other peer-to-peer exchange platforms like Paxful and Bitsquare are seeing record volumes as well.\nWhen looking at overall cryptocurrency markets globally, there has been a massive influx of volume when adding altcoin volumes into the equation. Daily cryptocurrency volume has surpassed $1 billion USD in trades due to significant price increases from other altcoins. Adding to bitcoin’s massive daily trade volume, altcoins like Ethereum, Dash, Tether and Monero have bolstered the overall market volumes.\nGlobal Localbitcoins volumes at an all-time high. 3/11/17\nAltcoin Markets Are Pumping \nThe four altcoins mentioned above have increased their market capitalization values exponentially over the last month. Ethereum is currently trading at over $39 per ether with a record market cap exceeding $3.5 billion USD. Another altcoin that has been rising in value fast has been Dash which is trading at $85 at the time of writing. Meanwhile, Monero has also seen a significant price increase reaching an all-time high of $21. These particularly fast market increases have led to a decrease in bitcoin’s overall market capitalization dominance, which has hit a low of 76 percent.\nOverall cryptocurrency market capitalization, daily volume, and bitcoin dominance according to Coinmarketcap.com, 3/16/17.\nBitcoin Price Moving Slow and Steady \nTechnical indicators show that Bitcoin’s bull market has tapered for the moment as the market moves slow and steady sideways. There’s been massive resistance moving forward above the $1,260 mark, and the 100-200 Simple Moving Average (SMA) suggest a slower uptrend. At the time of writing the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator show sellers seem to be in control for the moment, but order books and depth show a strong floor at $1,190-1,200. Roughly two days after the SEC announcement volatility has diminished quite a bit, leaving smaller gaps for day trading strategies. \nTraders may have taken a break from bitcoin markets to try and reap the benefits of the past month’s altcoin pumps. The price of bitcoin has done well for itself even though gains have been slower than other markets. Stability has been astounding as the price of bitcoin has remained above the 4-digit range for over a month thus far. Over the past week, the community seemed to have forgotten about the ETF decision and have focused most of their attention on topics like scaling.\nWhat do you think about this week’s cryptocurrency markets?

    "text": "\n Just recently Bitcoin.com reported on the Nigerian SEC Association’s warning about Multi-Level-Marketing (MLM) ‘cryptocurrencies’ such as Onecoin and Swisscoin. Our news team has uncovered quite a bit of shady activity while investigating Onecoin. This week we’ve decided to step into the realm of the so-called Swisscoin economy.\nRelated: The Far-Out Claims Behind Onecoin: The Self-Described ‘Bitcoin Killer’\nExploring the MLM Pyramid and So-Called ‘Cryptocurrency’ Swisscoin \nSwisscoin claims to be a cryptocurrency based on a decentralized blockchain, but in reality it operates more like a token MLM affiliate program with an upline and downline structure. Users are instructed to buy token packs paid for with euros or bitcoin as well as recruit members to join the Swisscoin organization. The project officially launched on June 4, 2016, and is reportedly run by the company director Manfred Mayer, a man with an extensive background within network marketing and MLM.\nThe company claims to be headquartered in the Canton of Zug, Switzerland where various cryptocurrency and blockchain startups reside. However much of the operations stem from Frankfurt and Leipzig, Germany, such as the company’s bank and registered domains. Furthermore, when visiting the Swisscoin member website, a vast majority of the text and news updates is written in German.\nRegistering as a Swisscoin Affiliate\nSwisscoin.eu login page.\nInitially signing up for a Swisscoin account is fairly straightforward and only requires a name and email. When I first signed up, I had to confirm the registration using a throwaway email, and I was then allowed into the Swisscoin website. Before I could do anything, I was greeted by a letter from the Swisscoin founder Manfred Mayer that read like a damages waiver. Following the weird letter, which also claims Swisscoin will one day be worth millions, I finally made it to the dashboard.\nThe panel takes a minute to get used to as there are multiple sections within the Swisscoin user interface. If people think bitcoin is hard to understand, this type of interface is a hundred times worse. Within the user dashboard, it shows me the free 100 coins I’ve received for signing up, and I’m given a sponsor named Reda [last name witheld] from Morocco. Reda is my upline connection which means all of my work and earnings give Reda a percentage of my funds.\nThe user-interface also gives me tutorials on how to buy packages of Swisscoin tokens and create revenue from my downline, which entails recruiting members to sign up for Swisscoin. Also, there is what’s called a barometer split that measures like a temperature gauge which claims it will reward my “E-wallet” with more tokens. At the time of writing the split is about 93 percent, so users have to wait just a little bit longer to reap their reward.\nThe assortment of token packages to choose from.\nThe biggest thing mentioned all across the entire platform is how they want you to buy packages. Each package contains a specific amount of tokens for a price denominated in euros. Packages of tokens are named by class and price such as Trainee, Trader-1000, Crypto-Director, and the coveted Ultimate. The cheapest package one can buy is €25 and the Ultimate costs €50,000. In order to purchase a Swisscoin package, I can use bitcoin, Payza, Swift, and Sepa transfer. The Swisscoin public bitcoin address has grossed over 2.5 million dollars in bitcoins according to blockchain explorers.\nAbsolutely No Signs of a Cryptocurrency Infrastructure \nSwisscoin shows no signs of being an actual cryptocurrency. The operating system looks like a clone of the NXT dashboard offering a holding tank for token packages. There is no blockchain explorer, and Swisscoin is not listed on market capitalization sites such as Coinmarketcap.com. The Swisscoin ‘whitepaper’ says a source code repository, and a blockchain explorer is “coming soon.” The organization offers a screenshot of a blockchain explorer instead.\nA ‘Blockchain Screenshot’ provided by the Swisscoin whitepaper.\nThe so-called digital currency has a lot of similarities to Onecoin with its packages, barometer splits, and promises to make you filthy rich. Swisscoin affiliates believe these tokens “have the potential to compete with leading global payment systems,” while always mentioning ‘blockchain technology’ throughout every aspect of the business.\nSwisscoin user dashboard.\nSpeaking to a Swisscoin Affiliate \nA few days ago I decided to reach out to my upline contact Reda from Morocco to get some more details about investing. I was provided with Reda’s email contact, and I sent this message:\n“Dear Reda, A good friend of mine told me about Swisscoin, and it looks like a lucrative investment. However, I have a family to take care of, and I can’t afford much. What’s the best return of investment package for someone with little to spend? What else do I have to do to earn? Sincerely, Posternut.”\nFourteen hours had passed, and I received this reply:\n“Hi Posternut, Your friend is a very smart person. You’ve come to the right place because we all will be very wealthy soon. Your best bet is the Crypto-Trader package which will give you 25 thousand tokens and immediate returns. If you want to make more money invite all of your friends and family members using your referral link. I do well asking my friends using Facebook, and sending links to all of my contacts. The more people who join Swisscoin the better it is for all of us. Feel free to contact me anytime for more information. Best, Reda.”\nSwisscoin is Not a Cryptocurrency \nOverall my entire experience investigating Swisscoin has shown the entire operation is a get-rich-pyramid scheme with no real value. In order to participate, you have to spend money on packages, and spend a lot of time convincing others to sign up below you. Everything about Swisscoin had red flags, and it is difficult to understand why people fall for these types of Ponzis. The Swisscoin operation runs in nearly every country in the world minus a few stricter regions like the U.S. Furthermore the leaders of Swisscoin are throwing an event this April in Dubai to entice followers to spend more money on this worthless token investment.\nThere are also multiple reviews of Swisscoin detailing that is a Ponzi investment from publications such as the Affiliate & Marketing Scams network and Behindmlm.com.\nThe bottom line — Swisscoin is not a cryptocurrency, there is no blockchain to be found, and there is absolutely no innovation involved with the company’s business practice. Swisscoin is a smaller version of Onecoin and uses the language of cryptocurrencies and “blockchain” as a veil to hide its sketchy business practices. As you can see from the video below leaders of Swisscoin just want people to purchase packages so they can make millions.\n\nWhat do you think about Swisscoin?

    "title": " Following its decision to disapprove Bats BZX Exchange’s proposed rule change for Coin ETF, the U.S Securities and Exchange",
    "text": "\n Following its decision to disapprove Bats BZX Exchange’s proposed rule change for Coin ETF, the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now has two more Bitcoin ETFs to consider; Solidx Bitcoin Trust and Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust. The Commission has until March 30 to make a decision on the former while the latter is many months away.\nAlso read: Examining SEC’s Decision to Reject Bitcoin ETF\nRejections Likely for Upcoming Bitcoin ETFs\nThe SEC’s decision to disapprove the proposed rule change for Coin ETF last Friday was primarily based on the nature of the bitcoin markets. The Commission claimed that Bats BZX Exchange must “have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading” bitcoin or its derivatives and that those markets must be regulated for the rule change to be consistent with the Exchange Act. However, since “the Commission believes that the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated”, the two criteria are not met.\nThe chance that significant markets for bitcoin will be regulated in the near future, if at all, is slim. The wider Bitcoin community has already come to understand this, and expects the Commission to reject the proposed rule change for Solidx Bitcoin Trust, as evident in chat rooms and forums online.\nConfirming the community’s expectation is former Needham analyst, who is now Head of Research at Blockchain Capital LLC, Spencer Bogart. Citing how the grounds for disapproval of Coin ETF “were related to the dynamics of the underlying bitcoin markets” as opposed to something specific in the ETF filing, he told Bitcoin.com that:\n\nThe odds of approval are very low for both of the other two Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBogart, who is famous for estimating a sub-25 percent chance of Coin ETF being approved by the SEC, now says that the chance for Solidx Bitcoin Trust is “extremely low”, noting that it is “likely to be rejected on the same grounds”.\nVery Little Anyone Can Do\nFurthermore, Bogart believes that both NYSE Arca and Solidx Management LLC, which is the sponsor of Solidx Bitcoin Trust, can do “very little” to better the chance of Solidx Bitcoin Trust being approved. Bogart said that he did not think NYSE Arca has a better chance of getting its rule change approved than Bats BZX Exchange, adding that:\n\nNYSE would need to enter into “surveillance-sharing” agreements with all the major bitcoin exchanges around the world and they would need to have a reasonable chance of regulatory action against any manipulative trading activity that is detected. Both are unlikely.\n\nFuture Prospect of SEC’s Approval\nThe SEC noted on Friday that, in the future, “regulated bitcoin-related markets of significant size may develop” enough for a Bitcoin ETF to be approved. However, Bogart believes differently, stating that:\n\nI don’t see the SEC approving a Bitcoin ETF for the foreseeable future. I think any major bitcoin investment products will need to be launched in other jurisdictions.\n\nOn February 24, NYSE Arca filed the first amendment to its proposed rule change relating to the listing and trading of shares of Solidx Bitcoin Trust under NYSE Arca Equities Rules 8.201. The comments are due on March 16. When the chance of approval is very low, exchanges sometimes withdraw their proposed rule changes. At press time, NYSE Arca has not done so and the Solidx team did not immediately respond to Bitcoin.com’s request for comment.\nDo you want the SEC to approve Bitcoin ETFs?

    "text": "\n On March 19, the bitcoin mining pool Bitclub Network mined its first Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) block as the mining operation is now signaling support for the protocol. \nAlso Read: Antpool Points 75% Hashpower at BU, While Exchanges Confirm Listing a Split\nBitclub Chooses Bitcoin Unlimited \nOver the course of the past few weeks, there has been an increase in support towards the BU client from miners. On March 17 the mining pool Antpool had pointed 75 percent of its hashrate towards BU and by the end of the evening close to 90 percent was signaling BU support. Now the mining pool Bitclub is changing the game by mining a BU block when the organization previously mined using the Core client.\nThe Bitclub Network’s pool currently holds 2.9 percent of the Bitcoin network’s global hashrate. This hashrate plus the added signal from Antpool will likely push the total BU support upwards. Currently, explicit mining pool support by proposal according to Coin Dance data shows BU is currently at 37 percent.\nThe Reason Behind the Switch \nOur sources have been in contact with the Bitclub Network operators, and they informed us of why they decided to switch proposal support. Bitclub says they have had significant issues with unconfirmed transactions. The Bitclub network has a lot of transactions going to and from its membership base, and new members began to have problems getting transactions confirmed.\nTwo leading members of Bitclub spoke with our sources and explained their frustrations with the current network congestion. The slow network has been a significant inconvenience for Bitclub, and they told to our sources they are making the switch from Core to BU to help with the goal of upgrading the Bitcoin protocol to facilitate more transactions. Moreover, the leaders explained how they have been watching Ethereum trade volumes rising, and they are very concerned about bitcoin going down because of the state of the network.\nWhen It Comes to Scaling Wheels Are in Motion\nThere seems to be a lot of bitcoin proponents concerned with the current state of protocol development with its rising fees and congestion issues taking place more frequently. Bitcoin businesses like Bitpay and Coinbase are changing their business models because network fees are too high for the companies to cover. Since the issues have become topics bitcoiners can’t avoid any more, node operators, and miners are taking action.\nBitclub and Antpool’s latest support show these two pools have moved past conversations and have decided to use their hashrate as a voice of reason.\nWhat do you think about Bitclub mining their first Bitcoin Unlimited block?

    "text": "\n Over the past few days, the Bitcoin network scaling debate has been a viral topic as the community has begun deliberating the viability of a hard fork and a possible blockchain split.\nAlso Read: Antpool Points 75% Hashpower at BU, While Exchanges Confirm Listing a Split\nA Large Group of Bitcoin Exchanges Reveal Hard Fork Contingency Framework\nOn March 17 roughly twenty well-known exchanges released a statement concerning the possibility of a hard fork and a network split. The statement noted that the exchanges believe a hard fork is imminent and how their business plan looks in that situation. The exchanges that signed the letter of intent statement detailed their plans of listing both token assets if a blockchain split takes place. This would include asset listings for Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) protocols. Exchanges who signed the letter include Bitstamp, BTCC, Bitsquare, Shapeshift, Kraken, and more.  \n“We have decided to designate the Bitcoin Unlimited fork as BTU (or XBU),” explains the participating exchanges. “The Bitcoin Core implementation will continue to trade as BTC (or XBT), and all exchanges will process deposits and withdrawals in BTC even if the BTU chain has more hashing power.”\nHowever, the statement of how exchanges would designate the names of the tokens listed has become a contentious issue for those supporting BU. Furthermore, the community and two signatory exchanges had noticed that the letter of intent was altered after it was published. Both Shapeshift and Kraken who signed the letter stated there were changes made to the original document they had signed. The issue at hand was calling the Core protocol BTC, even if that client was not the longest chain with the most proof-of-work running. Kraken explained they did not want to be in a position to decide which chain gets to keep the BTC moniker. Shapeshift founder Erik Voorhees explained his opinion of the name issue on Twitter stating:  \n“For the record, myself (personally) and Shapeshift would use the BTC/Bitcoin name for whichever chain unambiguously “won,” over time,” Voorhees detailed.\n\nExchanges profit on volatility and wealth moveing across chains they support.\nMiners profit from increasing value of coins they mine.\n— Gavin Andresen (@gavinandresen) March 18, 2017 Coinbase Releases a Statement\nCoinbase founder Brian Armstrong.\nOn March 18 Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong revealed his opinion of the recent contingency plan letter and explained why his company did not participate.\n“Coinbase didn’t sign this letter because I think the intention behind it is wrong,” Armstrong states. “On the surface, it is a communication about how exchanges would handle the hard fork, and a request to BU for replay attack protection. But my concern was that it was actually a thinly veiled attempt to keep the BTC moniker pegged to Core software. I think a number of people who put their name on it didn’t realize this.”\nArmstrong agrees that listing forked assets makes sense, but he doesn’t believe the BTC name should automatically go to one development team. “If there is overwhelming support from miners and users around any new version of the software (regardless of who wrote it), then I think that will be called Bitcoin (or BTC),” says Armstrong. The Coinbase founder says the company wishes to remain neutral in the debate.\nBitfinex Introduces Listing Pairs\nAdditionally, one of the exchanges who participated in the letter, Bitfinex released its own listing plan called Chain Split Tokens (CST). Bitfinex customers will be allowed to speculate on the future events of a fork using the CST tokens which include BCC (Bitcoin Core) and BCU (Bitcoin Unlimited).\n“Users will be able to create CSTs by “splitting” a bitcoin through the Token Manager (located in the order type drop-down menu of the sidebar order ticket),” Bitfinex explains on their website. “Once split, the BTC will be removed from your account for each BCC, and BCU added. Through the same Token Manager, you will be able to reverse this process at any time, trading in equal numbers of BCC and BCU to extract BTC.”\nThe discussion doesn’t seem to be over as far as the bitcoin name and branding is concerned. After the contingency letter, bitcoin proponent Olivier Janssens started a petition to get exchanges to remain neutral and not choose sides. “Designating Bitcoin Core as the default Bitcoin BTC/XBT is premature at best and at this point a highly political decision,” Janssens petition explains. There are quite a few bitcoin supporters who agree with Voorhees, Janssens, and Armstrong’s opinions concerning the longest chain getting the right to the BTC name, as many of them have referred to this quote offered by Satoshi in the bitcoin white paper;  \n\nIt is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid one.\n\nCommunity Discussions Continue\nAt press time Bitcoin Unlimited has roughly 35 percent of mining support so it still may be a while before any speculated split event takes place. It’s safe to say as of right now no one can predict who will rightfully claim the BTC name and branding, especially with a letter of intent that is disputed by other well-known exchanges.\n\nI love how industry-signed letters are becoming our new favorite consensus algorithm.\n— Vitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin) March 19, 2017 The discussion will likely continue, and Bitcoin.com will be following these events closely to keep our readers informed every step of the way.\nWhat do you think about the contingency plan drafted by some of the exchanges? Do you think that the BTC name should just be designated with Core or do you think the name belongs to the longest running chain? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

    "text": "\n Large scale DDoS attacks on Bitcoin.com and its subdomains started a few days ago and have heightened over the past 48 hours, in an apparent attempt at targeting the “big block” side of the ongoing disagreement within the Bitcoin community on how to scale Bitcoin.\nAlso Read: Antpool Points 75% Hashpower at BU, While Exchanges Confirm Listing a Split\nTruth Under Attack\nWhen Bitcoin.com re-launched the updated site in 2015, it was smack in the middle of the Bitcoin block size debate, which has also been called by many the Bitcoin “civil war”. It’s no secret that during this time, Bitcoin.com has positioned itself as a proponent for on-chain scaling solutions, as envisioned by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\nSince then, Bitcoin.com has worked with industry experts and leaders in the space to deliver news, uncensored information, and tools to the Bitcoin community. Most recently, Bitcoin.com has opened the Bitcoin.com Mining Pool, which mines using the Bitcoin client Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) and pays 110% block reward and has zero fees.\nDue to this, Bitcoin.com has been the target of individuals and groups that don’t share the same vision. And this week, the site along with the new mining pool and uncensored forum have all been targeted by attackers in attempts to bring down the site and stop the flow of uncensored information.\n\nAll of https://t.co/UtJJm85D5m and its subdomains have been under DDOS attack for several days. Beware of those who would try to censor you.\n— Bitcoin News (@BTCTN) March 18, 2017 Censorship in and of itself has been a huge point of contention within the Bitcoin community, which has had a real and lasting impact to the block size debate in many ways.\nDue to the heavy DDoS on Bitcoin.com domain and subdomains, the forum and mining pool all have had intermittent up-time. Bitcoin.com has also been working with Cloudflare to help mitigate the issues but some users may still be experiencing problems.\nSuspicious Timing\nIt’s also worth noting that the attacks have come at the same time as when the news was released that some Bitcoin exchanges unveiled a hard fork contingency plan. The signed statement has come under a lot of scrutiny because at least two of the exchange signers, Kraken and Shapeshift, said the document they signed was not the same as what they were originally shown. Also missing from the signed statement are several of the biggest exchanges on the market, Coinbase, Gemini, Localbitcoins, among several others.\nThe significance of the timing of these two events can’t be overlooked, as the signed statement clearly has been lauded by the same groups who don’t hold the same values and vision as on-chain scaling proponents in attempt to further smear on-chain scaling. In addition, there have been other subversive attempts at attacking the Bitcoin network in recent times, which has left many scratching their heads just who is behind these sorts of attacks.\n\nhttps://t.co/6EeRmpwLyF has been DDOSed all week. TIL from my CTO that many BU nodes identify themselves as CORE to avoid being DDOSed too.\n— Roger Ver (@rogerkver) March 18, 2017 We’ve also learned that many BU nodes have had to resort to identifying their nodes as Core because they are being DDoS’d also, as described by Roger Ver in a tweet sent today.\nWhat are your thoughts on the recent attacks on the Bitcoin network and on-chain scaling proponents?

    "text": "\n Although many Bitcoiners subscribe to laissez-faire political and economic beliefs of the libertarian variety, some “invisible politics” has reared its ugly head in the ‘Bitcoin Community’ thanks to the digital currency’s scaling issues. The growth of Bitcoin has created a variety of social governance problems that have left many in the ‘Community’ confused. \nAlso Read: Bitcoin Block Size Growth Plan ‘BIP100’ Gets Update\nBitcoin Governance\nWhile focus has been largely on scaling Bitcoin at the technical level to make room for increasing transaction demands, the distributed governance of Bitcoin itself has proven difficult. \n“There are two types of governance. Governance of a specific software project and governance over consensus rules,” submits Eric Lombrozo, Bitcoin developer and CEO of Ciphrex. “For historical reasons, the two have been conflated in the minds of many people.”\nMr. Lombrozo suggests problems could manifest in several ways.  “Governance over a particular software codebase doesn’t require universal agreement over all changes as long as it remains compatible with the existing network,” he says. “It’s only when compatibility is broken that it creates issues that affect everyone in the community.”\nFurther adding questions to Bitcoin’s social issues, when former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn left Bitcoin for R3CEV, he lamented how Bitcoin had become “completely controlled by just a handful of people.”\nBenevolent Dictator?\nCritics have claimed Bitcoin needs a “benevolent dictator” to expand and onboard an increasing number of transactions. “Someone, or some group, must decide how to meet users’ requirements,” Reuters reported on the opinions of some in the Bitcoin space. \nCornell Computer Science professor, Dr. Emin Gun Sirer, cites Ethereum, a blockchain smart contract model, and its “benevolent dictator model” as a working example of distributed governance.\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum founder and main programmer, in effect holds controlling decision-making power over that open-source creation community, some say (even though those who disagreee can fork the network).\nMr. Buterin has defended this model. “Over the last couple of years it’s become apparent that having a static protocol is just not a viable approach,” Buterin said at a blockchain conference. “Software has to evolve … and there has to be some mechanism for agreeing on how software is going to upgrade.”\nMr. Lombrozo points out, however, that Ethereum’s ‘benevolent dictator’ could not stop a split in the Ethereum blockchain, resulting in an duplicate version dubbed ‘Ethereum Classic.’\nGavin Andresen, Bitcoin’s former Chief Scientist, has discussed in YouTube videos how Bitcoin has evolved from a similar model after pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto’s departure.\n“If you go back in history, it was really simple. It was whatever Satoshi decided at the beginning. That’s really where we started. We had one source code. We had one [pseudonymous] person who made all the decisions about what should Bitcoin be, how should it evolve, and what should it do,” he said.\n\nAndresen added: “As soon as Satoshi stepped back and threw the project onto my shoulders, one of the first things I did was try to decentralize that. So, if I get hit by a bus, it would be clear that the project would go on. That’s why, at this point, there are five people who have commit access to the Github Bitcoin source tree. And there’s kind of this consensus process for what changes are made to the code — and even what consensus-level, low-level changes to the Bitcoin rules should happen.”\nIn an Internet Policy Review (IPR) article called The invisible politics of Bitcoin: Governance crisis of a decentralised infrastructure, this question is analyzed in depth. \nThe article paraphrases Yochai Benkler, who said “there are no spaces of perfect freedom from all constraints, only different sets of constraints that one necessarily must choose from.” \nBitcoin might be boasted as a trustless technology, but there’s still a catch. \n“It remains subject to the (invisible) politics of a handful of individuals – the programmers who are in charge of developing the technology and, to a large extent, deciding upon its functionalities,” reads the IPR paper.\nCan Technology Drive Social Coordination?\nThe paper concludes: “The mistake of the Bitcoin community was to believe that, once technical governance had been worked out, the need to rely on government institutions and centralised organisations in order to manage and regulate social interactions would eventually disappear. Politics would progressively give way to new forms of technologically-driven protocols for social coordination– regarded as a more efficient way for individuals to cooperate towards the achievement of a collective goal while preserving their individual autonomy.”\nIn a series of tweets, Mr. Lombrozo has shared his opinion about how Bitcoin might overcome the current gridlock caused by intense disagreement over numerous issues; namely, how to scale bitcoin to meet current transaction demand amid the social scaling problem itself. Many of his tweets have urged people to look beyond intense social media squabbles and start their own Bitcoin-based “cool” projects. \n“Decentralized systems require individual effort in discovering sources and filtering out hubris and noise,” he also tweeted. “This is true at the social level as well as the machine level.”\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin’s other scaling problem?

    "text": "\n European authorities have been steadfast towards regulating bitcoin because they believe digital currencies bolster money laundering and criminal financing. However, according to reports, a multitude of the UK’s leading banks have processed funds associated with money laundering operations and criminal organizations.\nAlso read: Digital Currency Regulation Heats Up In The EU As Parliament Proposes Additional Rules \nWhile EU Officials Focus on Digital Currency Money Laundering, Many European Banks Launder Billions From Criminals \nThe European Financial Commission and Parliament have been ramping up efforts to de-anonymize payment avenues such as cryptocurrencies and prepaid cards since February of 2016. Over the past year, EU government agencies have drafted and submitted proposals that target “unpermissioned” blockchains that utilize digital currency tumblers in order to combat money laundering.   \nThe EU’s regulatory agencies seem rather hypocritical towards a very small decentralized cryptocurrency economy when European and U.S. financial giants have laundered billions of dollars over the past decade. Just recently the news publication The Guardian has uncovered ties between Russian money laundering and a variety of well known UK-based financial institutions. Banks include seventeen European financial incumbents such as Barclays, Lloyds, Coutts, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and HSBC.\n\nHSBC processed $545.3m in laundromat cash, mostly routed through its Hong Kong branch,” explains The Guardian. “The troubled Royal Bank of Scotland – which is 71% owned by the UK government – handled $113.1m. Coutts – used by the Queen and owned by RBS – accepted $32.8m worth of payments via its office in Zurich, Switzerland. Coutts is winding down its Swiss operation and was last month fined by regulators for money laundering in a different case.\n\nEU Officials Draft Regulations for Digital Currencies With Considerable Exaggeration, While Traditional Financiers Have Been Laundering Billions Over the Past Decade  \nThis week EU legislators submitted a draft report that has added a few new cryptocurrency amendments to the official AMLD regulatory guidelines. Amendment proposals suggest there is quite a bit of concern when it comes to anonymity, specifically with public blockchains such as Bitcoin. However, recently one financial researcher suggests governments worldwide greatly exaggerate concerns in regards to the association between criminal financing and money laundering with cryptocurrencies.\n“Treating cryptocurrencies as an exceptional threat creates the misleading impression that more conventional financial products are not already equally, or more, vulnerable to terrorist exploitation,” explains the Royal United Services Institute consultant David Carlisle.\nHSBC money laundering and criminal financing estimates add up to £5.57 billion over the past decade.\nTraditional financial services like the current banking system are widely used for laundering and criminal financing according to many online resources. Estimates are in the billions in regards to these illegal activities, and a majority of funds stem from European and U.S. banks. For instance, the British multinational bank HSBC has been accused of laundering £5.57 billion over the years and had to pay a penalty of £1.2 billion in a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. authorities.    \nFurthermore, the Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) is estimated to have laundered £17.6 billion. According to reports, BCCI is widely considered as a bank that has helped facilitate drug cartels, gun smugglers, and small terrorist groups.\nBanks Say They Follow Strict AML Procedures But Cannot Deny Money Laundering Data\nWith the latest findings of European banks funneling large amounts of Russian funds, it shows EU regulatory agencies are apparently missing the fact that traditional banks far eclipse illicit financing within the bitcoin economy. According to The Guardian, news reporters reached out to all seventeen European banks who implied they strictly follow anti-money laundering guidelines, but not one bank could deny the data provided by the publication.\nWhat do you think about EU officials clamoring about bitcoin anonymity while European financial incumbents launder billions?

    "text": "\n Over the past two weeks, the bitcoin community has been discussing the possibility of a hard fork in the near future. Furthermore many industry exchanges and bitcoin-based businesses are already making preparations for such an event. A couple of questions bitcoin holders are asking are; Whether or not their bitcoins will be safe and what they should do during a blockchain split.\nAlso Read: Popular Bitcoin Exchanges Reveal Controversial Hard Fork Contingency Plan\nBitcoins You Possess Will Be Safe\nThe first and foremost piece of information all bitcoin holders should know is that in the event of a hard fork that splits the blockchain, bitcoins you possess will be perfectly safe. \nOver the past year or so hard forks have gotten a bad reputation for political reasons, but in actuality, most types of forks are merely protocol upgrades. A blockchain split occurs during a hard fork which in turn branches the chain into two parts. If this happens, there is nothing a bitcoin holder has to do but wait and watch the fork unfold.\nThe folks at the subreddit r/btc have compiled a very well written frequently asked questions post concerning protocol upgrades and how users are affected. The thread gives details about the hard fork process and what to expect.\n\nNeeds repeating…\nUsers: If you hold bitcoin and there is a HF, you will now own bitcoin on both forks. You don't need to do anything.\n— Andreas (@aantonop) March 13, 2017 When the blockchain branches into two there will be two digital assets immediately after the hard fork. Bitcoin holders who possess their private keys will have access to assets on both chains after the split event occurs. So, if you “keep your money” in a local wallet on your computer or on your phone you can just stay put and watch the fork happen.\nIf you hold money on a bitcoin exchange, then it will be up to the exchange’s discretion on how they choose to disperse both token assets to customers. Most of the well-known industry exchanges have already pledged to support both assets if a blockchain split event takes place.\nStoring Bitcoin On Exchanges  \nUsers should remember that holding cryptocurrency on an exchange is not recommended even during non-eventful times. As explained above, after a blockchain split customers storing bitcoin on an exchange will have to succumb to the rules of that specific trading platform. For instance, it’s highly possible that exchanges will pause withdrawals for 24-48 hours during and after the fork. Most reputable exchanges should and will likely disperse both assets to their customers sometime after the event, but users should expect a waiting period while the businesses assesses the situation.\n\nThe bitcoin exchange Coinbase explains the company’s current contingency plan to its customers concerning a hard fork and possible blockchain split which includes pausing deposits and withdrawals;\n“Ensuring the safety of customer funds is our top priority,” explains the San Francisco-based exchange. “In the event of a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol, it is likely that Coinbase will temporarily suspend the deposit and withdrawal of bitcoin from the platform pending our assessment of the technical risks posed by any fork, such as the possibility of replay attacks, network instability, or other factors. Customers should take note that they will not be able to withdraw bitcoin from or deposit bitcoin to Coinbase for a period of up to 24 hours or more following the fork. In the event of a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol, Coinbase may suspend the ability to buy or sell on our platform during this time.”\nThe other twenty or so well-known bitcoin exchanges that revealed their hard fork contingency plans last week will also list both digital assets (creating another account for their customers, for the “new” forked coin). Yet it is safe to assume these exchanges will also pause deposits and withdrawals during a split event. Customers will have to follow the rules of the exchange they store their funds with, and each business will have different guidelines.\n\nIndividuals Who Possess Their Keys \nUsers holding the private keys to their funds will have access to both chains after a split occurs. Depending on where the user stores their bitcoins they will have the means to access both digital assets by either waiting for wallet support or moving their funds to a different wallet platform that support both chains. For instance, the hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger explains what happens to people who possess their private keys using a cold storage device;  \n\nFirst of all, it is very important to understand that hardware wallet users control their private keys. So whatever happens, you will always have the possibility to export your keys and use your bitcoins on any software running on any chain or fork. Whatever happens, you do not need to move your funds prior to a fork, nor do you risk losing access to your coins on any side of the split.\n\nThis logic applies to every user utilizing an application that allows exclusive bitcoin key possession. There is no risk of losing bitcoins during a hard fork, and over a period of time after a blockchain split, users will be able to access both chains.\nControl Your Private Keys and Stay Informed \nForks are a part of most open source software protocols that mature, and many people believe bitcoin will experience a number of them in the future. Users should always consider possessing their own private keys at all times, so they have the ability to use their funds when they want instead of having to follow the guidelines of an exchange.\nThere is plenty of material online for people to research what will happen during this type of event and many Bitcoin businesses have detailed their hard fork plans. Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen has also written an informative blog post in regards to what may happen to a majority and minority chain. Andresen speculates what may happen within the market as far as price value, but also assures bitcoin holders their assets will be safe in the event of a blockchain split.\nHow do you envision a hard fork taking place with the possibility of a chain split?

    "text": "\n The EU has recently been very active in attempting to regulate digital currencies, including bitcoin. Last week, Bitcoin.com reported on the European Parliament’s proposal to amend the EU’s fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD), tackling digital currency anonymity. Now, a different proposal submitted by Parliament members is targeting specific areas of digital currency applicable to the EU fintech framework, including “unpermissioned” blockchains.\nAlso read: Digital Currency Regulation Heats Up In The EU As Parliament Proposes Additional Rules \nMany of the EU’s efforts to regulate digital currencies have been through amending the AMLD. Still in its early stage of the EU legislative process, this new proposal seeks to amend an existing EU fintech proposal called ‘Fintech: the influence of technology on the future of the financial sector (2016/2243(INI))’. In a recent draft report, members of the European Parliament urge the European Commission to consider several amendments directly concerning bitcoin and other digital currencies.\nInvestigating the Role of Bitcoin Mixers\nIn one amendment, Parliament members call on the European Commission to investigate the role of bitcoin mixers. Amendment 257, paragraph 16, reads:\n\n[The Parliament] Is concerned by the increased use of unpermissioned blockchain applications, in particular Bitcoin, for criminal activities, tax evasion, tax avoidance and money laundering; calls on the Commission to investigate the role of bitcoin mixers in this process.\n\nThis proposed amendment follows a global conference on countering money laundering and digital currencies in January which more than 400 financial investigators attending, including the FATF, Interpol, Europol, CEPOL and the Basel Institute on Governance. During the event, participants were told that: “All countries are advised to take action against Digital Currencies Mixers/Tumblers”.\nEnergy Usage and VAT\nSome amendments in the proposal revolve around Bitcoin mining’s “high energy” usage such as Amendments 159 and 252. One amendment reads:\n\n[Parliament] Notes that some implementations of DLT technology such as the Bitcoin blockchain have extremely energy intensive computational requirements and that, therefore, research should be encouraged to find ways of mining and verification that are energy efficient, especially for large scale uses.\n\nSome benefits of digital currencies and blockchains were also added to Amendments 160 through 162, including competition of currencies and using an altcoin for solar energy credits. The Parliament “stresses that the current emergence of currency competition between national currencies and private virtual currencies could benefit innovation and price stability”, one proposal reads.\nFintech and blockchain initiatives such as a solar coin as well as research to achieve “environmentally responsible energy use and behaviour” are also welcomed, according to Amendment 162, in order to “reduce the environmental cost of Bitcoin-mining and related activities”.\nAnother amendment concerning bitcoin is one where taxation of payments made with digital currencies was suggested. In October 2015, the EU Court of Justice ruled that bitcoin transactions are exempt from Value-Added Tax (VAT) “under the provision concerning transactions relating to ‘currency, bank notes and coins used as legal tender’”. A Parliament member added Amendment 160 which reads:\n\n[The Parliament] Calls on the commission to amend the VAT Directive so as to include into that payments made by virtual currencies.\n\nWhat do you think of this new EU proposal?

    "text": "\n On March 22 the Czech-based bitcoin hardware and software manufacturer Satoshi Labs has launched a redesigned Trezor wallet with a graphical data interface and newly added security features.\nAlso read: How to Restore a Hardware Wallet Using a Seed Phrase\nSatoshi Labs Introduces the New Trezor Wallet With Added Services  \nThe bitcoin hardware company Satoshi Labs has been a popular choice for bitcoin enthusiasts cold storage options since 2013. Just recently the company has completely redesigned its wallet interface with a variety of new feature services added. For instance, the wallet’s transaction tab displays multiple sources of data for better auditing.\nThe new Trezor wallet has multiple display features for transaction auditing.\nAccounts now show the full amount of funds received in the income section and the entire spent amount with the expense section. Furthermore, the display shows a graphical chart of how many bitcoins have been added to the account over time and with balances starting from the day the Trezor was activated to the present. The wallet also now displays the entire fee rate across all of the transactions sent from the Trezor account.   \n“The new design of the Trezor Wallet focuses on usability and familiarity,” explains Satoshi Labs. “You will see that only a little has changed in the operation logic, in order not to confuse you.”\nAdvanced Recovery \nTrezor’s “Advanced Recovery” mode.\nThe revamped Trezor wallet also has added a service that was previously only available using the command line interface. For instance, the new wallet now allows users to utilize the implementation of Jochen Hoenicke’s “Advanced Recovery” within Trezor’s beta channel. Satoshi Labs says this integration was a “highly requested feature” for Trezor customers that “assures no part of your seed will ever be revealed to your computer.”\nStandard Recovery is still a pretty safe process says Satoshi Labs, but Advanced Recovery adds a whole new layer of protections. Using traditional Standard Recovery methods users have to enter the recovery seed in a shuffled order to make the correct combination confusing to an attacker.\nUsing brute computational force an attacker has to “check through all the combinations of a 24-word seed, and the attacker would have to run SHA-512 (24! ÷ 256 × 8096) 19 621 680 704 813 697 269 760 000 times,” explains Satoshi Labs. So the process is still a fairly secure technique for cryptocurrency holders.\nNonetheless, the newly added Advanced Recovery makes things even more difficult for onlooking attackers and compromised computers.\n“In contrast with the Standard Recovery, the Advanced Recovery completely obfuscates the letters entered on the computer,” the hardware wallet company details. “Instead of writing whole words in a shuffled order, you will be inputting individual letters on the PIN-pad in a regular order. The computer will never know what letter is being entered, as the layout of the PIN-pad constantly changes.”\nMore Enhancements and Features Coming to Trezor \nSatoshi Labs says they are quite pleased with the redesigned wallet system and newly added security feature. The startup also says there are more enhancements and features coming to the Trezor wallet soon. However, because the process is more technical, Advanced Recovery will not become a default option within the Trezor wallet and users will have to utilize the beta version with up-to-date firmware to try the new security option.\nWhat do you think about the new Trezor interface and Advanced Recovery option?

    "text": "\n As I read the Bitcoin news each day and see the price of bitcoin cycling up and down, I’ve been thinking about the different sides of the blockchain scaling debate, and wondering what the best solution is for miners. While I realize that many of us signal (via our pool) our support of one proposal or another, a stable consensus seems elusive. As support for one proposal shifts to another, the forces that represent one idea or another shift to a different adoption method, and that can be frustrating for those of us who have had to change pools and reconfigure, in some cases, many miners.\nI consider myself a hobbyist. I have 20 or so miners, most of which only support SHA256, in a colo. But when I add things up, I easily have more than $30k invested in my mining hardware. If you say it out loud, it feels like a huge investment, and if bitcoin were to suddenly go insolvent due to a hard fork, or fundamentally, bickering, it would indeed be a huge loss to me and my family. This is why I think it so important for all of us to think very seriously about the future of bitcoin. People talk about all sorts of things—payment systems, etc.—but the thing that really matters, from my point of view, is the public ledger.\nIn my day job, I am in charge of enterprise architecture for a major corporation. This corporation, like so many others, invests capital in innovation and research, and blockchain technology is a focus of some of these investments. But no matter what types of blockchain tech you’re looking at, the “big” blockchain is bitcoin. For now. In order for bitcoin to maintain its dominance, it needs to scale to multiple applications—not just rest on its first “killer app,” which is the coin itself. When we look at off-chain scaling solutions, the big concern I have is how many alternative chains will exist. When those chains begin to pick up on the opportunity inherent in non-coin transactions, we, as miners, have lost the battle. The major source of fees in the long term will evaporate into the pockets of the people who run those alternate chains.\nLast week, we all had the opportunity to hear what exchanges were going to do if there was a fork. Then exchanges said that the document they had signed maybe didn’t look the same as it did when it was signed. Why was the document’s hash not published to the blockchain? Why weren’t the signatures cryptographic? Why can’t we have an irrefutable record of who signed exactly what? We can’t because there is no room. That document’s hash would have cost an unrealistic amount of money to embed due to current size restrictions and the ridiculous backlog of data waiting for a block.\nPerhaps the exchanges could have used an alternate blockchain. I am sure Ethereum would love to have that business. The truth though, is that business should be ours. With a variable block size, companies and individuals would have the ability to embed transactions of all types into the blockchain. Such transactions will just become more pervasive over time and along with the coin economy would drive huge fees due to volume, not scarcity, to our mining community. Anyone who has attached themselves to the scarcity wagon is in for a rude surprise. Someone is always willing to do something cheaper. Sometimes they can even do it cheaper and better.\nLet’s not give up our dominate position as the main blockchain that everyone wants their transactions written to. Take time, and make a choice—a choice that will promote our long-term position as the coin, and the blockchain for the future. If, as miners, we don’t act now, I assure you, someone will make a choice for us, and it won’t be the best long-term choice for our wallets. This is an Op-ed article.

    "text": "\n Only 807 people have declared Bitcoin for tax purposes, according to court documents filed by the IRS in San Francisco. If true, it is likely only a tiny percentage of virtual currency users have reported profits and losses in their annual income forms. \nAlso read: Some Blockchain Tokens are Securities, Researchers Find\nIs the IRS Warning Bitcoiners to Declare Bitcoin for 2017?\n\nFiled in San Francisco federal court on Thursday, the new documents further shed light on the reason why IRS has asked Coinbase to hand over a broad range of customer data, including every customer account and detailed transaction records over a considerable period. Coinbase pledged to fight the request.\nIn a new affidavit from IRS agent David Utzke, he discovered that fewer than a thousand people filed a Form 8480 to account for a “property description likely related to bitcoin.”\nThe affidavit reads: “The IRS searched the MTRDB for Form 8949 data for tax years 2013 through 2015. I received the results of those searches. Those results reflect that in 2013, 807 individuals reported a transaction on Form 8949 using a property description likely related to bitcoin; in 2014, 893 individuals reported a transaction on Form 8949 using a property description likely related to bitcoin; and in 2015, 802 individuals reported a transaction on Form 8949 using a property description likely related to bitcoin.”\nCoinbase said on Friday it has yet to hand over information. “Coinbase remains concerned with the indiscriminate and over broad scope of the government’s summons and we have produced no records under the summons,” wrote Coinbase lawyer, Juan Suarez. \nAccording to a Fortune source, the IRS and Coinbase have been in talks over what information exactly the digital currency exchange would provide.\n\nThe IRS received approval from a California federal court last November – just in time for tax season – to serve a so-called John Doe summons on Coinbase to determine whether or not Bitcoin users are declaring their virtual currency. \nBitcoiners “may fail, or may have failed, to comply with one or more provisions of the internal revenue laws,” the IRS opined in 2015.\nThe IRS has therefore requested user records between 2013-2015 from Coinbase, including transaction history, IP addresses and transcripts with customer support. Many Bitcoiners, to be sure, complain the IRS never provided guidance, even though requested by academics and accountants several years ago.\nAll Users of Virtual Currency Are Evading Taxes?\nBrian Armstrong, Coinbase founder and CEO, publicly rebuked the subpoena. “Asking for detailed transaction information on so many people, simply for using digital currency, is a violation of their privacy, and is not the best way for us to accomplish our mutual objective,” he wrote on Medium.\nHe added: “The IRS incorrectly implies that all users of virtual currency are evading taxes.” \nTax industry organizations have called for more clarity when it comes to Bitcoin taxes. “Creating a taxation framework that is stable and standardized, adaptable to digital trends, and maintains basic privacy standards is key to the broader development of the US bitcoin industry,” wrote the Americans for Tax Reform.\nIt could be, of course, that the IRS’ subpoena to Coinbase is their way of telling Bitcoiners in general that this is the year to start declaring.\nDo you think the IRS is getting serious about Bitcoin taxes?

    "text": "\n A new social media website, called Yours, has quietly launched on Bitcoin’s testnet. For Bitcoiners, that might mean within the next few months off-chain, peer-to-peer bitcoin micropayments on a social network. Yours claims to offer an “array of payment models”, which allow content creators to make money.\nAlso Read: Is Bitcoin the Currency of Artificial Intelligence?\nA Social Media Website with Micro-Payments Technology\n\n“Our centerpiece is the purchase model, which is very simple,” explains Mr. Charles, who once worked as Reddit’s cryptocurrency engineer. “Everybody who posts content to Yours – including articles, video, images, audio – can pick a place in their content to put a pay wall.”\nUsers set the price of their own content. “So, if you write a compelling article with a cliffhanger, you can hide the conclusion behind, say, a ten cent pay wall.” \nYours, as well, will offer a micro-payments wallet. This has proven a controversial technical arena in the Bitcoin universe. In recent years, as increasing amounts of throughput have been introduced to Bitcoin, the cost of transactions have gone up. Tiny transactions are no longer cost-effective on Bitcoin. Yours seeks to repair this. \n“We have developed a smart contract network on Bitcoin similar to the Lightning Network,” Mr. Charles tells Bitcoin.com. “Except our protocol is not dependent on Segwit and can run on bitcoin today.” \nThis will be very useful for some Bitcoin users who find the current fee environment to be too high. “Yours allows users to possess their private keys and have full custodial control over their funds at all times, while being able to participate in off-chain zero fee transactions with other users,” Mr. Charles tells Bitcoin.com. \nDeveloping a micro-payments platform was not easy for Yours. “Our smart contract system is several times more complicated than a normal Bitcoin wallet,” according to Mr. Charles.\nWith the Yours testnet launched, anybody can pay for content, but not everyone can post. \n“If you want to post, you will have to do a one-on-one demo with us so that we can get your real-time feedback about the experience,” Mr. Charles explains. \nSoft Launch to Scale\nThere are numerous models allowing individuals to get paid on Yours, including paywalls on content. Further, a classic endorsement model will allow content creators to earn as users pay to upvote their content. Another model sees readers pay to see ads. Commenters can earn when their comments are upvoted. Individuals can also invest in a creator’s content, in order to earn returns on that content’s income over time. Overall, Mr. Charles is trying to take Yours slowly. \n“We need a slow influx of users to help us identify the most important bugs before launching to a large audience,” he says.\nWould you use Yours over Reddit?

    "text": "\n The bitcoin wallet Breadwallet has just launched the ability for users to buy bitcoins from inside their iOS app. This feature will be rolled out over the next two weeks, starting today. Bitcoin.com talked to founder and lead developer Aaron Voisine to find out more about this new on-ramp to Bitcoin.\nAlso read: Popular Bitcoin App Breadwallet to Launch Built-In Exchange\nControlled Rollout\nAccording to Breadwallet’s announcement:\n\nStarting today, iphone users in the United States will start receiving the ability to buy bitcoin through the breadwallet app, either with cash at one of thousands of retail locations and bitcoin ATMs, or by linking a bank account.\n\nInitially, not all Breadwallet users can access this feature. “This will be a controlled rollout” available for only a small number of users, according to the company. “We’ll be enabling for 10% of users (randomly chosen) on launch day, and then ramping it up to all users over the next two weeks”, Voisine told Bitcoin.com.\n“At launch the service is available in the US, excluding NY”, he explained, reiterating that users can only exchange their US dollars for bitcoin currently. However, he noted that “we will continue adding more locations and local currencies going forward”. Following this iOS launch, he said:\n\nThe android version is in the works and is planned for roll out next quarter.\n\nLast December, the company invited US and Canadian iOS users to beta test buying bitcoin with cash. The company described at the time that “options include both bitcoin ATMs and physical store locations where you can purchase bitcoin from a cashier”. It noted that all “the nearby options for purchasing bitcoin with cash” will be displayed on a map once the user choose the “Buy Bitcoin” option and then “Cash” within the app.\nUsing Kraken for Bank Transfers\n“The payment processing will be handled by our exchange partners in each locality”, Voisine explained, adding that “our launch partner in the US market for bank transfers is Kraken”. He also noted that, after paying in fiat, “the funds are sent upon completion of the ACH transfer, which is typically 3 to 5 days”.\nHe detailed:\n\nThe conversion rate is the market spot rate at the time the order is placed. The exchange fee is 1%.\n\nKraken has been offering the ability for wallets to buy bitcoin in-app since it acquired non-custodial wallet funding service Glidera last December, renaming it Kraken Direct. The service offers “one-click buying and selling of bitcoin” from a wallet via ACH bank transfers and “never takes custody of their funds during the process”, Kraken’s website explains. The company claims to currently support “around 10 of the top wallets including Airbitz, Copay, Mycelium and Multibit, with many more in the development pipeline”.\nFollowing this iOS launch, “we’ll be quickly adding new locations and local currencies for bitcoin purchasing”, Voisine conveyed. “We’re also working hard to bring other new financial service offerings, as well as improved user experience around sending and receiving bitcoin (like BIP75) without compromising on the security, openness, or decentralization of the platform”.\nWould you use the Breadwallet app to buy bitcoins?

    "text": "\n The question is a large obstacle to the mass adoption of digital currencies and it should be addressed head-on. The audiences being targeted as adopters are also a problem. The question and a problem overlap.\nAlso read: A Decentralized Money Needs A Distributed Web for Maximum Freedom\nCalls for mass adoption usually aim at the mainstream and often translate into some form of government approval. This approach alienates two significant categories of people who should be fellow travelers: “preppers” and “survivalists.” (For the differences between them, click here.\nPreppers and survivalists are rigidly individualistic and anti-government. The crypto-community needs them to counterbalance the trend toward licenses, regulation, and state control.\nThere are two problems with outreach, however: some voices in the crypto-community are openly hostile or scornful to preppers and survivalists; many preppers and survivalists view bitcoin with skepticism. The later ask a reasonable question which is often shrugged off: will bitcoin survive a collapse of infrastructure which could include the electric grid?\nI have no doubt that digital currencies will not only survive but also grow as they have in the chaos that is Venezuela. But, again, the question is reasonable and deserves a respectful response.\nThe Crypto-Community\nFirst, the indifference or hostility of some within the crypto-community.\nPreppers and survivalists were once viewed as bizarre dissidents but this is an antiquated attitude. Many of their lifestyle strategies, such as stockpiling canned goods and precious metals, are now mainstream and don’t occasion a sideways glance. Nevertheless, sophisticated bitcoiners may feel alienated from people who actively espouse a less technical lifestyle. This is not a barrier with outreach to these groups, however, as much as it is a barrier to connecting with the vast majority of average people.\nNot reaching out is one thing. Being openly hostile is quite another. Many within the digital community may not be blatantly antagonistic to preppers and survivalists. But, to the extent preppers and survivalists are addressed, it is often in a tone of contempt. For example, Jeff Berwick wrote about the subject at The Dollar Vigilante,\n\n[T]hese people [“Shit Hits The Fan” people] have a subconscious hatred for bitcoin because a) Gold has not performed as well as bitcoin and b) because they missed out on the massive gains to date. To those people, you need to let go of your hatred. Your hatred manifests in your own body and people just really won’t even want to be around you as you shout at the TV every time they say bitcoin has hit a new all-time high. And, as well, your obsession with SHTF scenarios is also not healthy. As I said above, the scenarios are very real. But they also may not happen.\n\nBerwick’s psychoanalysis of SHTF people is baffling. Nevertheless, he raises two points that spin into the next barrier raised against preppers and survivalists from adopting digital currencies.\n• the scenarios of a possible collapse are “very real;”\n• the scenarios may never occur.\nA common reason why preppers and survivalists reject digital currencies is because it requires the internet and electricity, both of which could easily become unreliable or unavailable. A sack of gold beneath the woodpile can be easily accessed and exchanged for the necessities of life. Digital currency…not so much.\nIn Defense Of The SHTF People\nThe scenarios of a collapse are “very real.” The economy is speeding toward a brick wall. Civil society has never been so contentious. And, then, there are global tensions. A key reason preppers and survivalists dismiss digital currencies is that they view them as overly dependent upon fragile infrastructure.\nTo take preppers and survivalists seriously, consider just one unfolding situation: North Korea. The leader Kim Jong-un is an egotistical madman who may soon have the nuclear capacity to reach American soil. He may currently be able to attack American military bases in the region as well as Japan.\nA simplistic sketch of background. In March, Kim test-fired four missiles into seas off Japan. Recent U.S.-Japanese naval ‘exercises’ in the area were followed up by a stern warning from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of a possible pre-emptive military strike, presumably to take out missile sites. North Korea counter-threatened with a nuclear strike if the Americans so much as fired one rifle and, then, it tested “a new…high-thrust rocket engine.” Another test occurred last Friday.\nMeanwhile, Tillerson’s talks with Chinese leaders – the only nation able to rein Kim in – appear to have gone poorly. And the installation of a powerful American anti-missile system in South Korea could not have helped. Upcoming talks between Trump and China may be more productive but only if someone budges on profound disputes such as who owns the South China Sea Islands.\nThe preceding detail is offered as proof that worrying about your safety and your family’s is not hysterical. Not worrying may be the ridiculous position.\nBut will a nuclear war happen? I don’t believe so. Nuclear war is highly unlikely if only because it would devastate every nation in the region, including the initiator.\nIt is far, far more likely that the threats will continue and deepen the cold war that’s been spreading for decades: namely, computer attacks aimed especially at financial institutions and infrastructure.\nA severe economic collapse seems inevitable, however\nWhither Bitcoin During A Cold War?\nThe question remains. Even without nuclear war, would bitcoin be able to function during a collapse or a cold war?\nYes. Electricity and the internet may be less reliable or more expensive but they would be available. An increasing dependence on the blockchain would make it a top economic priority.\nIt would also be a top military priority. In October 2016, the Pentagon revealed it was actively exploring blockchain technology “to create tamper-proof military computer systems, including those used to control America’s nuclear weapons.” Other nations are undoubtedly doing the same.\nConclusion\nThe bad news: an economic collapse or a cold war would negatively affect the internet and the electrical grid.\nThe good news:\n• Aspects of the internet were specifically designed to survive war by being decentralized.\n• The blockchain will be essential to both societal and global functioning which means the internet will be given top priority.\n• Local economies will be also be built on the blockchain. “Most of the technologies already exist. Distributed Identity (Blockstack, Bit ID, etc) combined with on chain issuance of assets (MSC, Counterparty, Colored Coins) combined with off chain transference and transactions of such assets (Hyperledger, Open Transactions, etc).”",

    "text": "\n The infamous Gaw Miners company and investor Stuart Fraser may see the courthouse soon in a civil lawsuit against the defunct operation. A U.S. judge from the state of Connecticut denied Fraser’s request to a default judgment and hearing extensions.\nAlso read: SEC Officially Indicts GAW Miners CEO for ‘Hashlet’ Ponzi Scheme\nGaw Miners Sued for Selling a ‘Progressive Array of Products’ of Which They Did Not Own\nGaw Miners was an organization that allegedly ran a mining operation and a cloud-based Ponzi that failed miserably in mid-2015. Gaw’s founder Homero Joshua Garza and associates like Stuart Fraser were under great scrutiny from the bitcoin community due to shady mining operations, the Zen miner program, the “Hashlet” packages, and the notorious digital currency Paycoin. In December of 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicted Gaw Miners and Garza for operating a Ponzi scheme.\nThe Gaw Miners “Hashlet” scam.\nFollowing this event, in the summer of 2016 customers of Gaw sued the company and investor Stuart Fraser for fraudulent activities. The civil suit which is taking place in the district court of Connecticut seeks damages from the company due to defendants selling “what they did not own and misrepresented the nature of what they were selling.”      \n“From approximately March 2014 through December 2014, defendants sold a progressive array of products and investment contracts to over 10,000 investors that defendants claimed would yield profits from mining or otherwise investments in virtual currency,” explains the civil suit against Gaw miners.\nJudge Michael Shea Denies Default Judgment Request and Hearing Extensions\nOn March 21 the court received a motion from Fraser’s legal team Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP asking the judge for a default judgment call. Fraser has repeatedly denied allegations of his involvement with the mining operations. The court ruled against the motion and vacated the default judgment stating;    \n\nThe Court addresses herein multiple pending motions. First, the Motion to Dismiss [ECF No. 41] is DENIED because it does not address the operative complaint. The Court will consider the Motion to Dismiss [ECF No. 61] the operative complaint in due course. Second, for the reasons set forth in Plaintiffs’ memorandum, [ECF No. 68-1], the order granting motion for default entry under Rule 55(a) as to GAW Miners, LLC and Zenminer, LLC [ECF No. 65], including the deadline to file a motion for default judgment by March 1, 2017, is VACATED.\n\nWill Gaw Investors Get Restitutions Soon?  \nStuart Fraser denies any involvement with Gaw. However, his Linkedin profile that has since been removed revealed a different story.\nThe people behind the curtains of the Gaw Miner operations are accused of manipulating lots of investors and using “cryptocurrency jargon”, masquerading their true intentions. The company’s bitcoin cloud mining operations and the Paycoin scam reaped in millions in revenue but never paid off for investors. The company was widely accused of not even owning any legitimate mining operations at all while some speculated Garza and affiliates sold the mining rigs before the company went under.\nWith Judge Shea’s recent decision the civil suit against Gaw, Zen and Fraser looks like it will gain some traction in the near future.\nWhat do you think about the court case against Gaw Miners, Zen Miners and Stuart Fraser?

    "text": "\n This past February, Valiollah Seif, governor of the central bank of Iran, told press on national television that Iran would eliminate the use of the U.S. dollar within the country. As the middle eastern country’s economic situation shifts, the region is steadily becoming fertile ground for bitcoin adoption.\nAlso read: You Might Be Exchanging Bitcoin With Trading Bots and Not Even Know It\nBitcoin’s Censorship Resistance History of Bypassing Economic Sanctions in Iran\nOver the past few years, people have stated they believe Iran is the perfect candidate for embracing bitcoin’s censorship resistant utility. The logic behind this is largely due to the U.S. sanctions against Iran, which strictly enforces economic embargos and trading bans against the country. Many other countries also follow the sanctions as the U.S. and the United Nations Security Council has put a lot of pressure on allies to support the trade guidelines.\nBecause of the strict economic sanctions the subject of bitcoin and Iran made headlines in 2012 from a report published by Bloomberg. The article explained that “dollar-less Iranians had discovered the virtual currency.” Bitcoin’s were becoming quite valuable in Iran because they could be easily spent abroad by citizens the report detailed. Iranian-American bitcoin consultant Farzad Hashemi said residents were amazed at how easily it could help them spend money overseas.        \n“They are instantly fascinated by it,” Hashemi explained. “It’s a flash for them when they realize how it can solve their problems.”\nImage courtesy of the Bitcoin Iran Facebook page.\nThe Iranian Bitcoin Environment\nBitcoin’s legality in Iran is unclear as the country’s authorities have not officially established a political stance on the decentralized currency subject. Citizens currently rely on Localbitcoins for their bitcoins and also utilize a marketplace called Coinava. The peer-to-peer marketplace has been offering Iranians a platform to buy and sell bitcoins since 2013. Coinava is similar to Craigslist as users can meet to trade bitcoins in their local area. The Iranian bitcoin platform uses an escrow to hold traded funds and charges both parties 1% for the transaction.  \nTranslation: “Welcome, Coinava is connecting Iranian bitcoin buyers and sellers.”\nAlso, Bitcoin Iran’s public Facebook group has over 31,000 members, and there are very active Iranian bitcoin meetups as well in the country. Moreover, a shoe company in Iran called Persian Leather Shoes is a bitcoin only business. The Persian shoe company explains why it only uses bitcoin for shoe sales on its website stating;  \n\nOur business is making and selling leather products. We like to sell our products across the world and the more customers the better. The problem is we operate in Iran and most payment systems either are not willing to serve us at all or impose a huge risk on our business — Now, with Bitcoin and the help of Bitcoin community we are hoping to become a role model for other small businesses in Iran to find global customers.\n\nUsing Bitcoin for Iranian equities on the Tehran Stock Exchange\nMikael Johansson, founder of Brave New World Investments.\nLast week, according to a local Iranian news outlet, a Swedish firm called Brave New World Investments plans to use cryptocurrencies as a way to bypass trading sanctions in Iran. The startup aims to fund its operations with bitcoin as an investment vehicle for Iranian equities on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE). \nThe Linköping, Sweden-based Brave New World Investments (BNW) says it started its business because Swedish banks “fear” doing business with Iranian financial institutions. The firm’s founder Mikael Johansson details the startup will operate entirely with cryptocurrency with their partners and European shareholders.\n“Now we simply do not have a Swedish bank account. However, we soon will have an Iranian bank account for the equity investments. We pay our bills, shareholder dividends, Iran deposits – everything – in cryptocurrencies,” explains Johansson. “There are no sanctions in Sweden or in the European Union obstructing Swedish-Iranian investments, so we are not breaking any laws in our jurisdiction.”\nBitcoin.com spoke with Johansson and asked him if he thinks problems may arise concerning the U.S. sanctions.\n“I think every operation where you do not know your bitcoin counterparty well, you might run into problems with sanctions,” Johansson told Bitcoin.com. “We will perform an audit on our process to ensure that no sanctions are accidentally broken.”\nThe benefits of bitcoin’s censorship resistance is working well for citizens of Iran and those wanting to do business in the middle eastern country. With the central bank removing the U.S. dollar away from the region residents may find the attributes of bitcoin more tempting.\nWhat do you think about bitcoin adoption in Iran?

    "text": "\n Bitcoin’s decentralized nature is one of its most important features; it is the feature of freedom. This means bitcoin is not arbitrarily controlled by a central group of jackbooted thugs, political leeches, or other enemies of liberty.\nAlso read: Where Do You Stand on the Yin & Yang of Different Bitcoin Ideologies?\nIt is true Bitcoin relies on a set of developers to make decisions in terms of protocol changes (albeit dependent on approval by miners and node operators), but in no way do they possess the same authority as the sociopaths who manipulate the central banks in the United States do. Consensus among the developers and community determine the growth, evolution, and direction of the protocol.\nFreedom Cells\nPeople work in the garden at the Freethinker House in Houston, Texas.\nIn this manner, Bitcoin pairs perfectly with a new type of decentralized, freedom-based community. These communities are what anarchist and freethinker Derrick Broze refers to as Freedom Cells.\nIn Broze’s upcoming book Manifesto of the Free Humans, to be released on April 7, written with co-author John Vibes, they describe what they mean by “freedom cell.”\nThese are small groups of renegades that consist of roughly eight members that unite in a decentralized fashion. Their goal is to work cooperatively to live outside the confines of the State. Broze has even started his own freedom cell in Houston, Texas, and refers to their living quarters as the Freethinker House.\nIn their book, Broze and Vibes describe Freedom Cells as,\n“Peer to peer groups made up of 7 to 9 people (with 8 being ideal) organizing themselves in a decentralized manner with the collective goal of asserting the sovereignty of group members through peaceful resistance and the creation of alternative institutions.”\nThese Freedom Cells implement agorism to power their activity. Agorism is a term coined by late philosopher Samuel Konkin III. It is the philosophy that people should make voluntary exchanges on the black market and subsist through these markets for the purposes of creating social change. Konkin referred to this type of activity as counter-economics.\nBroze and Vibes have taken this counter-economic philosophy and uniquely created a practical way to implement it via decentralized freedom cells, and thus Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies provide the obvious type of currencies these groups can use.\nBitcoin Decentralization and the Underground Economy\nThe decentralized nature of Bitcoin allows freedom cells to prosper in an underground marketplace. It is true that many freedom cells may use a barter system as the primary portal of economic activity, but cryptocurrency provides alternative, digital, pseudonymous, and transferable store of value.\nMatter of fact, Bitcoin has the capacity to help incentivize people to create decentralized, peer-2-peer freedom cells, because it makes living economically within those groups more practical and exciting. An interesting side-effect of decentralization is it places emphasis on the smaller community or subgroup.\nHow Freedom Cells Flourish\nWhen people realize they do not need central planners to run their lives, they immediately start thinking on a small scale. When there is no more government to defer to, people do not imagine that faraway authorities should control them or tell them how to live. Bitcoin is a part of this decentralizing process, and other cryptocurrencies may also fill a similar role.\nBitcoin allows freedom cells to flourish, because it helps these groups make trades without necessarily using a barter system. It provides them with a technological means for accomplishing the same thing, except with more practicality. In essence, crypto-money was created as a technology to make economic transactions simpler and freer. This currency was intended to be the dominant currency of the counter-economy, and it will let more maverick liberty groups illuminate more paths to freedom and prosperity.\nHow would you leverage cryptocurrency in your Freedom Cell?  Images via Shutterstock and Derrick Broze’s Free Thinker House Facebook page.

The “Bitcoin Wallet Standards Initiative” had some of the most popular and leading wallet representatives within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nAlso read: Fifty Developers Hack With Bitcoin for Two Days in San Francisco\nThe First Annual Bitcoin Wallet Standards Initiative\nBitcoin wallets developers share a mutual interest when building the cryptocurrency wallets we all use today. Lots of companies use similar industry standards within the bitcoin wallet environment like deterministic wallet infrastructure, security features and more. This weekend a large group of bitcoin wallet developers met at the popular bitcoin-accepting bar in Berlin, Room 77. The Bitcoin Wallet Standards Initiative (S3ND) had wallet representatives from fifteen different platforms attend among other industry developers.\n\nS3ND included representatives from popular bitcoin wallet companies such as Ledger, Trezor, Green Address, Bitgo, Armory, Electrum, Mycelium and many more. Furthermore, the meeting also included bitcoin proponents such as the Lighting Network developer Olaoluwa Osuntokun (Roasbeef) and core developers Luke-jr, Jonas Schnelli, and Matt Corallo attended as well. The S3ND initiative’s road map also plans to host more wallet standards round table meetings in the future to create better wallet interoperability.\n“Developing a common language and the best-practices for wallet design, without preventing competition and the freedom of wallet designers to innovate, is critical to users,” explains the  S3ND founding principles. “Bitcoin must be interoperable. Users must be able to choose the wallet software and hardware they want, with the freedom to migrate when they see fit.”\nOther Wallet Developers Express Interest \nBerlin’s popular bitcoin-accepting bar Room 77 hosts the first annual Bitcoin Wallet Standards Initiative (S3ND).\nThe meeting at Room 77 discussed subjects such as wallet migration, Segwit, Bitcoin Proposal discussions (BIP), multi-sig standards and more. “As the organization matures, working groups will continue to develop standards independently, which will be discussed and ratified at annual meetings,” details S3ND organizers. Furthermore, attendees focused a lot of attention towards privacy standards such as private transaction relays, and common transaction formats. While a significant amount of wallet companies are members of the organization other digital currency programmers are welcome to attend.\nOther bitcoin wallet representatives who could not attend expressed their interest in the wallet standards roundtable.\n“We would have loved to attend this,” said the developers of Samourai Wallet. “Unfortunately we didn’t see any advanced notice of this event taking place. Looking forward to the outcome of this event.\n“I would love to attend (Breeze Tumblebit Wallet), but unfortunately it’s the other end of the world,” explained Adam Ficsor, a contributor to the Tumblebit research paper.\nS3ND Summarization and Github Organization \nOne of the organizers of the event, Lightning developer Roasbeef, explained to wallet developers who could not attend that a summary of the event would be created in the near future. “We will likely prepare a summarization document to be published after the event which goes over the topics discussed, action items, and follow-up work. Keep on eye on this Github org,” Roasbeef detailed.\nOrganizers seemed pleased with the first annual S3ND and the creation of a forum for wallet standards. Members believe the meeting will lead to better wallet design and “more efficient and applicable standards processes can be developed.”\nWhat do you think about the Bitcoin Wallet Standards Initiative (S3ND) roundtable meetings?

    "title": " Bitcoin mining has become a competitive industry within the cryptocurrency economy. With all the large data facilities and pools",
    "text": "\n Bitcoin mining has become a competitive industry within the cryptocurrency economy. With all the large data facilities and pools these days people often wonder what it takes to get involved with mining.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Mining: A Closer Look Under the Hood\nA Few Calculations Before You Start Mining\nMany people are interested in mining bitcoins from home, but these days it’s become increasingly harder for home-based miners to make a profit. In order for an individual to join the mining environment, they need to figure out if it is worth it by calculating a bunch of different factors. Then they must either build a machine capable of mining or purchase a pre-built mining rig to join this aggressively competitive sector.\nThe first thing people need to do is check a few statistics. This includes the mining hardware’s hashrate execution, the Bitcoin network’s current difficulty, and the electrical costs associated with a mining device. These steps are needed to assess the performance of a custom built or purchased a mining computer. Building custom mining rigs are slowly becoming a dying art as pre-assembled mining computers with Application-Specific Integrated Circuitry (ASIC) have become a dominant force within the industry.\nThe Four Variables\nHashrate\nA pre-built mining device from a well-known manufacturer will give you the details of the machines hashrate execution or the speed at which the device can perform mining calculations. Device performance is typically measured in terahashes for every calculation solved per second. This statistic can be measured against the current bitcoin difficulty [the calculation of how difficult it is to find a hash] which can give a person a rough idea if their machine performs well. Mining difficulty changes every 2016 blocks and the current network difficulty is 460,769,358,091 at the time of writing.\n\nElectricity\nMining also includes the cost of electrical consumption. Unless someone is stealing or getting free electricity, the cost to power a mining rig always comes into play. In order to figure out a machines return on investment (ROI) miners must divide the hash execution performance by the number of electrical watts consumed. Large mining facilities have found ways to offset electrical costs by utilizing more different types of resources such as hydropower and geothermal power. Electric power has different costs depending on where you live, for instance, the U.S. the average people pay is roughly 12 cents per kilowatt-hour. In other areas around the world, electricity is cheaper particularly in regions like China, and India.\nDevice Cost\nAnother calculation to figure into the equation is the cost to acquire a mining device. Pre-manufactured mining rigs can be anywhere from US$500 to $2,000 depending on performance and if the device is new or used. To get ahead of your original investment you have to mine enough bitcoins to cover the price of a machine and only after meeting this cost a person then can profit. Other things to consider are buying racks for multiple machines, connectors to tether all of the miners together in unison, and keeping capital handy for replacement parts.    \nTime and Maintenance\nBitcoin mining also takes time to set up the machines and maintain them. Also just like any computer that operates consistently, factory parts can malfunction, and bitcoin miners often need fan replacements because devices run so hot. Additionally, it helps to be computer savvy and know how to use software, command lines, and be able to configure wiring and replacement parts. Larger data facilities hire employees to take care of thousands of machines running 24-hours a day.       \n  Popular 2017 Mining Rig Companies and Products\nCurrently, there are only a few dedicated mining rig manufacturers that produce mining rigs. The two most popular mining rigs available in 2017 from the Bitmain Antminer brand include the R4 home miner and the S9 series. Both machines consume roughly 845-1375 watts and calculate hash solving at 8.6-12.9 terahashes per second (TH/s).\n\nFurthermore, this past November another mining device manufacturer Canaan announced the launch of the Avalon 721 ROQ Solid Miner. The latest release from Avalon uses custom 16 nm ASIC chips and what the firm calls a “Smart Layout.” The Avalon 721 operates at six TH/s and uses 900-1200 watts while operating. Avalon also boasts an open source repository for its mining software.  \n\nPeople can also build their own custom mining rigs or assemble a data station using devices and parts from multiple companies. Parts to make a homemade rig and mining machines made by a manufacturing company are in high demand and can be expensive. Anyone can estimate a mining ROI with variables given from the machine’s performance and today’s bitcoin difficulty statistics. There are also calculators on the web that can assess the performance of a miner and estimate an ROI. However, every day after the ROI timeframe will be different due to increases in electrical cost, and changes to the network’s mining difficulty.\nBitcoin Mining Can Be for Money and for Fun \nGetting into the bitcoin mining game isn’t easy, and it can be difficult meeting the original investment. For some machines, it could take a year or longer to get an ROI with today’s difficulty. Moreover, machines have to be maintained and being technically savvy can help a great deal as there are a lot more variables to deal with when beginning to mine bitcoins. A lot of people say that individual mining isn’t worth it these days so many people join pools to better their chances at reward. Furthermore, some people mine just to help support the network and participate because it can be a fun hobby. Whatever the case may be preparing to mine bitcoins is a bit more complicated than it used to be.\nWhat do you think about individual and home mining? Do you think it is still profitable?

    "text": "\n Bitcoin gambling has continued to rise in popularity over the years. Many people believe Bitcoin is the perfect currency for online wagers and cryptocurrency-based gambling statistics have shown that the market agrees.\nAlso read: Lucky Week at Bitcoin Games Roulette Table as Players Win 154 BTC\n$4.5 Billion in Bitcoin Wagers Since 2014 \nIt is clear that Bitcoin gambling is just one of many excellent platforms that demonstrates the cryptocurrency’s real-world use cases. Using bitcoin has allowed for more privacy-centric gambling, alongside quicker ways to fund casino accounts, pay out jackpots and reward players. Online gambling is a huge industry with a volume of $45.86 billion in 2016 and Bitcoin has captured just a tiny fraction of this market so far.\nNonetheless, the use of Bitcoin at online casinos has steadily risen every year with many people placing their bets with cryptocurrency daily. Bitcoin gambling has been around since the currency’s inception and in 2013 Bitcoin betting accounted for over 50 percent of all Bitcoin transactions. A research report released that year detailed “online gambling represents at least 10x the transaction volume of Silk Road and the other Bitcoin drug marketplaces.”\n12/2014 to 4/2017 Gambling statistics according to the Bitcoin Strip.\nAccording to the Bitcoin Strip, a website that tracks online Bitcoin casino statistics, over 24.5 billion bets have been placed with bitcoins over the past two years. In 2017, the popularity of Bitcoin gambling continues to grow as there are now hundreds of cryptocurrency gaming destinations on the web. According to statistics throughout sixty cryptocurrency-based gambling sites, people are placing 337 bets per second and are wagering three BTC per minute. Moreover, since 2014, roughly 3.7 million BTC has been wagered equating to $4.5 billion USD at the time of writing.\nAccording to Bitcoin Strip the total BTC wagered over the past two years is 3,750,898 BTC.\nBitcoin Gambling Site Domains Sell for Big Money  \nLast month a domain called “bitcoin.casino’ sold for a record sale of $28,000 for the .casino extension portal. A Florida-based firm called Casino Holdings bought the bitcoin.casino domain and the website hosts reviews of Bitcoin gambling sites found online. According to statistics, searches for .casino domain extensions have been on the rise this year. Furthermore, Bitcoin based casino-style gaming sites have been selling like hot cakes for quite some time. Shapeshift founder Erik Voorhees sold his website, Satoshi Dice, for over $11.5 million (126,315 BTC) back in 2013.\nRegulatory Restrictions\nBitcoin and online gambling has increased in nearly every country in the world bar the U.S., Russia and a few other regions. Currently the U.S. has significant regulatory policies against online gambling in general throughout the country. Most of the restrictions stem from the Unlawful Internet Gaming Enforcement Act (UIGEA) that was created back in 2006. According to the act, the UIGEA “prohibits gambling businesses from knowingly accepting payments in connection with the participation of another person in a bet or wager that involves the use of the Internet and that is unlawful under any federal or state law.” As a result the vast majority of Bitcoin casinos and cryptocurrency wagering sites refuse to operate in the U.S. to this day.\nHurdles Aside Bitcoin Gambling Continues to Grow Beyond 2017\nUsing Bitcoin to play classic casino games such as blackjack, roulette, dice and more will likely continue to increase as statistics have shown. Some residents from countries with stricter regulation may not be able to participate, but many other regions are seeing a lot of growth in the gambling market. \nRegardless of regulation issues, cryptocurrency gambling continues to rise every year, and 2017 is no different. Three bitcoins gambled per minute over the past two years shows cryptocurrency and online wagers are working quite well together.\nWhat do you think about bitcoin and gambling?

    "text": "\n Some people believe the properties of precious metals like gold far exceed the fundamental attributes of Bitcoin. Over the years, many have claimed that gold is scarce and is hard to counterfeit. However, there have been cases that have proven gold is not as scarce as we think and the soft metal is often substituted with phony imitations.\nAlso read: Japan Declares Sale of Bitcoin Exempt from Consumption Tax\nGold’s Scarcity Compared to Bitcoin\nOne of the most valued properties of Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency’s capped supply at 21 million units. Scarcity is believed to be a valuable trait to humans as economists believe this attribute fends off market behaviors like inflation. Most people consider precious metals like gold and silver to be a scarce commodity within our world. However, over the years it has become more apparent that gold’s scarcity may be somewhat of a falsehood.\nFor instance, scientists have found there are vast amounts of mineral elements in space, specifically in asteroids. Asteroid mining, which mines raw material from floating space rocks, is a legitimate venture that will likely take place in the near future. The practice will enable people to mine and transport gold, silver, iridium, palladium, and platinum back to earth. However at the moment this process is expensive and could cost billions just to get started, but the NASA mission OSIRIS-REx is just one of many projects working on this goal. One asteroid can hold hundreds of thousands of kilograms of gold, depending on size. Google’s Planetary Resources also plans to mine asteroids.\n\nOn earth, there may be even more gold than we think, for instance under the ocean floor and new mining locations are found every few years. Just the other week, on March 29, over 382 tons of gold were found in Shandong China. Reports state that the mine’s value is estimated to be over $22 billion (RMB150billion), which in itself is larger than Bitcoin’s current market capitalization. Reports reveal the mine is one of the largest gold reserves ever found in China and the potential excavation can be finished in only two years.\nFool’s Gold\nIt is a known fact that Bitcoin cannot be duplicated or counterfeited. The network will not accept a forged bitcoin and will reject anyone trying to double-spend any unit in this capped supply. Gold proponents will also tell you the precious metal is also hard to counterfeit.\nJust recently, in Edmonton Canada, local law enforcement officials issued a warning to the public about a potential fake gold bar scam. Various merchants in Edmonton purchased fake bars last year, that investigators reported to be “professionally packaged and authentic.”\n“We tested the product for authenticity and quickly determined these gold bars were nothing more than copper bars plated in gold,” explained EPS Criminal Investigation Officer Robert Wellon.\nFurthermore, last month, investigators in China revealed an ongoing investigation in which they discovered a fake gold operation stemming from the Boyuan Mining company. The knockoff gold bricks allegedly scammed investors and financial institutions out of 11 billion CNY. Moreover, the gold was used to secure mortgages and pledge loans from the People’s Bank of China and Shanxi Province Rural Credit Cooperatives. Using gold as collateral for loans and real estate deals is common in China. Suspects used 62 percent tungsten in the forged bars, but the outer shells were solid gold.\nBitcoin’s Benefits of Sound Money Exceed Gold\nIt is clear that gold’s scarcity and anti-counterfeiting claims are a bit misleading. On the other hand, Bitcoin will never have more than a 21 million capped supply, and forgery is extremely hard to accomplish within the Bitcoin network. Furthermore, the number of bitcoins in existence is far scarcer than we think due to losses, thefts, and concepts like proof-of-burn.\nThe attributes of sound money, as far as scarcity and counterfeiting are concerned, is superior with Bitcoin in comparison to precious metals like gold. Furthermore, when it comes to sound money, Bitcoin also excels with its aspects of divisibility, portability, and durability.\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin’s anti-counterfeiting and scarcity attributes compared to gold?

    "text": "\n Wikileaks has exposed the CIA’s hacking tools and techniques in “the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.” Some readers are probably compromised without knowing it – if not by the government, then by criminals who have acquired the non-secured tools. Here’s how to assess your vulnerability and what to do about it. \nAlso read: Bitcoin Gamblers Have Wagered $4.5 Billion in BTC Since 2014\nWhat is “Vault 7”?\n“Vault7” is Wikileaks’ codename for a series of massive document releases on the e-surveillance and cyber-warfare techniques of the CIA. It is not known how many releases will occur but four have so far.\n\nMarch 7: “Year Zero” contains over 8,000 documents or “more than several hundred million lines of code” – that render the CIA’s entire hacking capacity.\nMarch 23: “Dark Matter” documents several CIA projects to infect Apple Mac firmware and explains how the CIA gains “persistence” on “Apple Mac devices, including Macs and Iphones” and how it uses “EFI/UEFI and firmware malware.”\nMarch 31: “Marble Framework” offers 676 source code files for the CIA’s program that aims “to hamper forensic investigators and anti-virus companies from attributing viruses, trojans and hacking attacks to the CIA.”\nApril 7: “Grasshopper” contains 27 documents from the CIA regarding “a platform used to build customized malware payloads for Microsoft Windows operating systems.”\n\n“Year Zero” is the most interesting to Bitcoin users because it documents proximate dangers. “Grasshopper” is also important to examine.\nWhich Devices are Vulnerable to CIA ‘Infection’?\nThis Wikileaks dump reiterated something we already knew; Our devices are fundamentally unsafe. No matter what kind of encryption we use, no matter which secure messaging apps we take care to run, no matter how careful we are to sign up for two-factor authentication, the CIA—and, we have to assume, other hackers—can infiltrate our operating systems, take control of our cameras and microphones, and bend our phones to their will. The same can be said of smart TVs, which could be made to surreptitiously record our living-room conversations.\nConsider just three.\nSmartphones\nReason magazine states the danger simply. “According to Wikileaks, the documents show the CIA has a specialized unit specifically for stealing data from Apple products like the Iphone and the Ipad, and another unit for Google’s Android mobile operating system. These units create malware based on ‘zero- day’ exploits that the companies that develop the compromised systems are not aware of.”\nPC Backdoors\nCIA can reputedly infect computers which run on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7. Mac OS or Linux – those are reported to be affected as well.\nWeeping Angel\nC/net reports that Weeping Angel is an “alleged spying tool, co-developed by the CIA and the UK’s MI5 security agency, which lets a Samsung Smart TV (specifically, the F8000 Smart TV) pretend to turn itself off — and record your conversations — when you’re not using the screen.” Although there is evidence of development since 2014, there is no hard evidence of completion. Note: Samsung drew sharp criticism in 2015 when its smart TVs were shown to be recording private conversations.\nWeeping Angel may not affect Bitcoin use directly but it demonstrates the pervasive surveillance being pursued by the CIA.\nA Truly Troublesome Wrinkle – Criminals\nMost people will not be targeted by the CIA or even by government agencies with which the hacking tools may have been shared, like the IRS. But the CIA seems to have lost control of their own tools including weaponized viruses, malware, and trojans. The tools, code, and strategies apparently circulated freely among former contractors and hackers for the U.S. government, who were not authorized to view them.\nNBC News reported on an interview with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. “Assange ridiculed the CIA for failing to guard information about its online arsenal, allowing it to be passed around within the intelligence community. That is how the material ended up in Wikileaks’ hands ─ and, possibly, criminals’, he said.” Wikileaks has “held off publishing viruses and other weapons”; it has delayed publication in order to first “disarm” the tools.\nYou should assume that weaponized hacking tools are in private hands. The CIA may not consider you “worthy” of targeting but criminals are less discriminating.\nWhat to Do in Self-Protection?\n\nAvoid the specific companies, devices and operating systems mentioned in Vault 7. Wikileaks has compiled an impressive list of the “companies, products, tools, and terms that are mentioned in the Vault 7: CIA Hacking Tools Revealed publication to date.” The list is here.\nSome companies, like Mozilla, have vowed to fix the vulnerabilities, and Assange has provided incentive. A headline in the Washington Examiner (March 18) stated, “Wikileaks threatens to reveal tech companies that haven’t responded to help offer against CIA hacks.” But how will you know if the companies actually come through? If you are loyal to an operating system, as I am to Linux, then take further steps.\nDon’t abandon encryption. It still offers better security than “naked” transmissions.\nIf your iOS and Android devices are compromised, so are your apps because input can be grabbed before encryption. Use open source software whenever possible. Richard Stallman of the GNU Project explained: “Proprietary software tends to have malicious features. The point is, with a proprietary program, when the users don’t have the source code, we can never tell. So you must consider every proprietary program as potential malware.” (Android’s core is open source but closed source has been added on top of it.)\nKeep strangers physically away from your devices, because some of the compromises revealed seem to require a physical interaction.\nUpdate your operating systems to the latest version. The company may have fixed security weaknesses and your current system may not accept security updates. Alternatively, consider switching to an older “dumb” phone.\nUse an antivirus program. If a backdoor was installed with the company’s cooperation, malware may not be detected, let alone fixed, by security updates.\nDon’t just turn devices off. One security advisor suggests treating microphones as if they were guns. Always assume they are loaded and unplug them.\n\nStay safe out there.\nWhat do you think about the CIA’s hacking tools, and Vault 7?

    "text": "\n Hackers in North Korea reportedly stole large amounts of bitcoins between 2013 and 2015. South Korea was one of the targets, but not the only one.\nAlso read: Why South Korean Bitcoin Adoption Could Outpace Most Other Countries This Year\nBitcoins Stolen from 2013-2015\nRadio Free Asia (RFA) is a private, nonprofit international broadcasting corporation based in the US. The publication reported on Wednesday that North Korean hackers stole more than 100 million won worth of bitcoin, approximately US$88,000, each month from 2013 to 2015.\nChoi Sang-Myong is a senior official at South Korea’s cybersecurity firm Hauri Inc. He told the publication, as translated by South Korea’s largest news agency Yonhap, that:\n\nCyber criminals have turned to bitcoin for money as it is very difficult to track them down. Since tracking down the culprits is very difficult, North Korea had jumped on the bandwagon of bitcoin extortion since around 2012.\n\nFirst Target: South Korea\nThe relations between North and South Korea became extremely strained in 2013, during the Korean Crisis, when North Korea blocked access to the Kaesong Industrial Region for all South Korean citizens. Both countries agreed to reopen the industrial park four months later, but tensions stayed on edge in the meantime.\nAccording to Choi, the bitcoin thefts targeting South Korea began during the two weeks that followed the shutdown of the Kaesong industrial park that year. North Korean hackers soon stole about 40 million won worth of bitcoin from South Korea at the time, Choi revealed, but noted that the country has not been the only target. He added:\n\nAfter that, they were confirmed to have secured more than 100 million won in bitcoin every month.\n\nWhile Choi confirmed North Korea’s bitcoin theft activities up to 2015, he speculated that the hackers involved may have moved onto other more profitable fields thereafter.\nBitcoiners in North Korea\nBesides the hackers, there have not been many reports of Bitcoin users in North Korea, due to their totalitarian internet policy that limits access to a handful of elites and scientists.\nHowever, in January 2014, the first claimed Bitcoin transaction was sent from North Korea, for the amount of 0.1037 btc to Sean’s Outpost, a homeless shelter in Pensacola, Florida. Using the discontinued Changetip app, Reddit user Bitcoindprk proved that he was on a tour in North Korea and sent $100 at the time to the famous Bitcoiner’s charity, run by Jason King. In doing so, the nameless Redditor demonstrated that Bitcoin truly has no borders.\nAdmitting that it would be a few years until the locals would even get access to the internet, he also claimed that he had been handing out paper wallets “with a few mbtc each to the Korean guides” who accompanied him on the tour.\nDo you think North Korea is one of the biggest bitcoin Hodlers?

    "text": "\n Microsoft Office users can now create immutable documents with help from the Bitcoin blockchain. On April 10 a blockchain document certification and verification application called Stampery was added to the multinational tech giant’s Microsoft Office program.\nAlso read: Skeptics Show Concern as UASF Gains a Following\nMicrosoft Office Add-on is a Bitcoin Blockchain Certification Feature \nMicrosoft has shown support for Bitcoin-related applications for quite some time. Now a company engineer, Ville Rantala has announced the implementation of the Stampery blockchain add-in for it’s Microsoft Office suite. Essentially users can certify and verify documents using either the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain. Microsoft’s engineer believes enterprise organizations and individuals need to record and secure important documents every day. Immutable certification and verification are crucial to the integrity of legal documents and contracts that cannot be manipulated, Rantala details.\n“An alternative to relying on a single entity (commercial, public, government, etc.) to keep such proof of identity safe is to create a hash of the document and send that hash to the publicly accessible blockchain, such as Bitcoin,” Microsoft’s Senior Engineer Rantala explains. “Once the hash data is present on the public blockchain, the document can’t be changed without invalidating the hash. This approach guarantees both the document’s privacy and the data’s availability for future validation purposes.”\nHow the Stampery program works using Microsoft Office.\nBlockchain Certification and Verification Without Leaving the Office Program\nMicrosoft’s Rantala says they utilized a secure API to introduce the Stampery add-in to Microsoft Office and Outlook without leaving the program. This means the add-in blockchain certification and verification buttons can be found in the software’s toolbar. The engineer’s blog post details how the process works within the platform’s user interface;\n\nCertification: Pressing the certification button calls a JavaScript function in Office. This function hashes the document and sends the sha256 hash to a Node.js server as a REST call, so the document never leaves Office. The Node.js server runs as an Azure App Service and keeps a copy of the hash for later verification before calling the Stampery API with the hash. The Stampery service then takes the hash and puts it onto the public Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains.\nVerification: Pressing the verification button calls the Javascript function from the certification process again, which hashes the document and sends the hash to the Node.js server as a REST call. The Node.js server then calls the Stampery API to access the original hash for the document from both blockchains.\n\nStampery’s certify and verify buttons can be accessed within the Office application without leaving.\nA Notary Solution for Individuals and Enterprise Customers\nRantala believes adding Stampery to the Office platform will enable users to employ a more secure method of document storage. Furthermore, the tech company’s engineer thinks enterprise customers will find the feature very useful as the application can ensure the validity of important business documentation. Created in 1988 Microsoft Office is one of the most popular word processing software suites utilized in office and business settings worldwide.\nThe code for the Stampery Office add-in is open source, and the protocol can be reviewed on Github. “Users should be able to see that documents sent to them are signed or stamped, then verified or notarized,” explains Rantala.\nWhat do you think about the Microsoft add-on blockchain tool Stampery to the company’s Office suite?

This means that the company employs real-time, time-stamped verification for its identity product. Civic describes this activity as a firewall between civic and the user’s identity.\nA tech crunch article provided further information on how the network functions, saying, “This system is made possible through Civic’s Identity Protection Network, which will be a network of businesses who collect users’ personal data, including their SSN. This network could include members like banks, financial services, healthcare organizations or any other company that asks for your SSN. Consumers will be alerted when their SSN is used by a Civic partner.”\nEvolving ID Authentication\nThey refer to their type of blockchain-based ID security on their Identity Protection Network as “evolving authentication.”\nWhen users sign up to the platform, they are allowed to authenticate their identification and use different signatory defenses to prevent nefarious actors from accessing personal credentials.\nThe Civic Website says:\n\n“Authenticate without the need for traditional physical IDs, knowledge based authentication, username/password, and two-factor hardware tokens.\n\nCivic wants people to use their service so they can secure their personal identification on the blockchain and protect themselves from hackers and other criminal activity.\nCivic Partners with Intel to Provide More Protection\nAccording to Civic’s website, they are also teaming up with Intel in order to provide extra security.\n\nThe startup believes this is an exciting innovation using blockchain technology and Software Guard Extensions together. According to Intel, SGX is a codex of new instructions that can be used by applications to segregate private sets of data. This denotes credentials that can be stored and authenticated without having them loosely floating around in physical form or unprotected on the internet.\nLingham’s company further states that they offer (SPS) secure private sign up and (SPL) secure private logon via the civic application.\nDo you believe Civic’s blockchain-based fraud prevention and protection is useful?

    "text": "\n The sinister acts of the global elite continue as many headlines reported this weekend revealed the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) being scrutinized for monitoring global bank transfers. A group of hackers called the Shadow Brokers who tried to blackmail the NSA for one million bitcoin have released files revealing the NSA’s control over the SWIFT interbank messaging system.\nAlso read: Your Bitcoins Open to CIA and Criminals, Heed Wikileaks’ Warning\n The Shadow Brokers Reveal the NSA’s Access to Private Information \nBack in August of 2016 Bitcoin.com reported on a hacking organization called the Shadow Brokers and their dealings with the NSA. At the time the notorious group of hackers told the NSA if they didn’t pay the group one million bitcoins they would reveal evidence of fraud and zero-day exploits used by the NSA to access people’s private information. Following the event, some bitcoiners believed the NSA was possibly baiting the Shadow Brokers with small amounts of seized bitcoins.\nThe bitcoin address used by the Shadow Brokers never received the one million bitcoins from the NSA, but the wallet has collected over $12 thousand USD worth of BTC since the initial blackmailing. Whether or not the money came from ‘agents’ or from public donations is unknown, but not one satoshi has left the wallet. Over the past eight months, the hacking group has released highly classified data allegedly stemming from the U.S. security agency. \nThis month the Shadow Brokers is once again releasing more information because the NSA didn’t pay up. The data leaked by the hackers includes possible NSA developed zero-day exploits to all Windows systems prior to Windows 10 and evidence of the NSA monitoring the SWIFT system and global bank transfers. The Shadow Brokers also detail that the group has more classified information to release in the future stating;    \n\nWho knows what we have coming next time?\n\nPossible Windows Operating System Exploits and SWIFT Surveillance \nAccording to a Wired interview response from Matthew Hickey, owner of the security company Hacker House, the collection of data released by the Shadow Brokers reveals more than 20 exploits in the leak. Furthermore, the hacks include possible exploits to quite a few versions of the Windows operating system. The alleged hack can give an attacker the ability to control a PC from a remote location from anywhere around the world. However, according to a Microsoft spokesperson the company told Wired and many other publications that all of the exploits have been patched. According to Reuters, some security researchers detail some of the Windows exploits may still work.\nAdditionally, the leaked data and exploits had revealed the monitoring of global bank transfers and quite a bit of spying on banks in the Middle East and Latin America. Reports show the exploits attacked the SWIFT messaging system which transfers billions in national currencies every day. SWIFT has stated there currently is no evidence the network was accessed without them knowing, but has released a security update for all its customers. “We mandate that all customers apply the security updates within specified times,” SWIFT stated to Reuters.\nThe NSA’s Reach is Massive\nRevelations from Edward Snowden has shown the NSA and the European GCHQ has quite the overreach over our private data and financial lives, some say more so than we can possibly imagine. The Shadow Brokers latest release also details how vulnerable the current banking system is and in the future incumbents know they will likely fall victim to superior technology like the Bitcoin blockchain.

    "text": "\n Bitcoin.com just launched a document notary page. Anyone can use it. Just log\nonto notary.bitcoin.com and upload a document. It will then be etched onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin.com notarized Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper as its first document proof. \nAlso read: New Bitcoin.com Podcast Episode with Patrick Dugan of Bond Issuing Omni\nNotarization is a service that has previously been the province of government agencies. Governments monopolized this service to control people, but times have changed. The Bitcoin.com website says:\nHistorically, governments acted as trusted third parties by issuing important life documents (like property titles, drivers licenses, and birth certificates).\nTraditionally, people have wanted sensitive documents time-stamped and permanently verified for proof of ownership without assistance, and now the blockchain can assist with the same service. Certifying documents costs about 0.0050 BTC, or 6 dollars.\nA Blockchain Notary is a Cryptographic Digest\nThe purpose of this action is to file a document on the\nblockchain, and have a time-linked historical reference to it. Technically, a document can include government typified paperwork, high-pixel film, or even a region-marked photograph or piece of artwork.\nBitcoin.com’s website put it this way, “A cryptographic digest of your document will be stored in the bitcoin blockchain, linking it to the time of submission. Your document could be anything, from an input-constrained form like conventional government documents to a full-resolution movie or location-stamped image.”\nTrustless Document Storage at Bitcoin.com\nHaving a document trustlessly inscribed on the blockchain has several benefits. The primary benefit is that documents are backed on the blockchain in perpetuity. This means that the document’s footprint exists in cyberspace even if the physical copy vanishes.\nHowever, this also implies that the document stored will never be exposed. Its contents are not displayed via the blockchain. It is merely “dated” and cryptographically recorded, in which case its existence can be proven when necessary.\nBitcoin.com’s website clarifies:\nYou control your own information — your document’s contents are not stored in the blockchain or ever exposed.\nProve your document existed by comparing the blockchain entry of your document’s cryptographic digest to your actual document (if and when the need arises).\nWill you be trying Bitcoin.com’s notary page anytime soon?

    "text": "\n Researchers from ETH Zurich and the Hebrew University have found how “internet routing attacks” and “malicious Internet Service Providers (ISPs)” can attack the Bitcoin network. In their research paper entitled “Hijacking Bitcoin: Routing Attacks on Cryptocurrencies”, they describe the attacks as well as countermeasures against them. The paper will be presented at the 2017 IEEE Symposium on security and privacy in May.\nAlso read: Attacks on Data Privacy May Get Scarier in 2017\nInternet Routing Attack Vector\nThere are already many known Bitcoin attack vectors such as double spending, the 51% attack, DDoS, eclipsing, and transaction malleability. However, the authors asserted that:\n\nOne important vector has been left out though: attacking the currency via the Internet routing infrastructure itself.\n\nWhile a Bitcoin node can be run from anywhere on earth, the researchers found that most of them are hosted with a few ISPs. Specifically, they found that 13 ISPs host 30% of the entire Bitcoin network. In addition, 60% of all possible Bitcoin connections cross 3 ISPs.\n“Together, these two characteristics make it relatively easy for a malicious ISP to intercept a lot of Bitcoin traffic,” they wrote, adding that “any third-party on the forwarding path can eavesdrop, drop, modify, inject, or delay Bitcoin messages such as blocks or transactions.”\nTwo Types of Attacks Warned\nThe paper then describes two types of attacks claimed to be practical and possible today.\nThe first is called a “Partition attack” which aims to partition the Bitcoin network or “completely disconnect a set of nodes from the network”. The second is called a “Delay attack” which aims to delay the propagation of new blocks to a set of Bitcoin nodes without disrupting their connections.\nTo determine their effects, the authors set up a network and initiated the attacks on themselves. They performed a hijack in the wild against their own Bitcoin nodes to learn the effect of a Partition attack. For a Delay attack, they used an interception software against their own Bitcoin nodes. They eventually came to the conclusion that:\n\nThe potential damage to Bitcoin is worrying. By isolating parts of the network or delaying block propagation, attackers can cause a significant amount of mining power to be wasted, leading to revenue losses and enabling a wide range of exploits such as double spending.\n\nPossible Countermeasures\nThe paper offers various suggestions to combat the routing attacks of both kinds. While nothing is a cure for all attack types, the more countermeasures deployed, the more effective a defense Bitcoin users will have.\nBoth long and short-term countermeasures were suggested. Recommended strategies include increasing the diversity of node connections, selecting Bitcoin peers that are routed further away, monitoring round-trip communication times, and even encrypting all node traffic. The research team also proposes monitoring any other additional statistics so that deviations from normal behaviors can be immediately identified at each node.\nThe full list of countermeasures can be seen here.\nWhat do you think of these attacks?

    "text": "\n Someone identifying himself as Satoshi Nakamoto has been answering questions on the popular question and answer website Quora as if he were indeed the inventor of Bitcoin. He claims to be an American living in Bali who will meet with visitors locally. Bitcoin.com reached out to him to find out his story.\nAlso read: Craig Wright Wants to Kill Satoshi by Becoming Him…Again. Why? And How?\nBali-Based “Satoshi” Offers to Meet in Person\nA Bali-based “Satoshi” in 2001, posted on Facebook\nUsing the title of “former founder and creator at Bitcoin from 2008 to 2010,” the Quora user by the name of “Satoshi Nakamoto” began answering economic-related questions on April 3. He is the 17th user going by this name on the popular website and has been actively answering questions. At press time, he has posted 19 answers with rapidly-growing 32,400 views and has 161 followers.\nThis “Satoshi” has stated in no uncertain terms that he is the creator of Bitcoin, adding that: “I live in Bali, Indonesia, and I was actually born in 1977; not 1975. I am American – not bloody English!”\nSpecifically, he is staying at the Berry Biz, a small but opulent hotel located on the southwest side of Bali’s capital city, Denpasar. In replying to a user wanting to meet him, he wrote:\n\nI stay at Berry Biz; just Google it and ask the front desk to call Satoshi Nakamoto. I will come down to meet you.\n\nDefending His Existence\nIn a recent post, he wrote: “I am very real, however, everyone who is supposed to be me – isn’t! I am so far removed from that ‘so called’ eligibility list that it would be impossible to guess who I am.” He then gave his email address and said he has a facebook profile.\nOn Facebook, there is a profile page created in March for a Satoshi Nakamoto living in Bali, who is originally from Texas. The page description matches his Quora-derived information. It also contains a Virginia State driver’s license photo which the page owner claims to be his younger self, taken in 2001.\nNo Cryptographic Proof\nBitcoin.com emailed him, questioning if he could provide any type of cryptographic proof by sending some of the earliest of Satoshi’s coins, or signing a message with Satoshi’s PGP private key from 2010. “Mr. Nakamoto” told Bitcoin.com:\n\nI can’t sign any messages because my old email (satoshin@gmx.com) was highjacked a number of years ago. It contained my only backup of all my private keys.\n\n“All my Bitcoin private keys were once held within a single encrypted notepad document. One copy was stored on my laptop, and the other was stored in my original GMX email account; however, neither sources are accessible now,” the self-styled Bitcoin creator continued. “A sequence of events unfolded in 2010 that caused me the loss of all my keys.” The explanation also hints to why he decided to leave Bitcoin development behind. “After I lost ‘incentive’ to continue with the Bitcoin project, I announced to the world that I was moving on to other things.”\nIn addition, he said he has been trying to come forward since 2010. However, “everyone is too focused on who they think I should be. Every time I tried to publicly announce who I am, I get humiliated or treated with extreme hostility and disrespect.”\nHe’s not Craig Wright, but He is Pro-Patent\nCraig Wright\nThe Bali-based, self-proclaimed Satoshi said that he is not Craig Wright, the infamous Australian who’s also claimed to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto. “Craig Wright was nothing more than a mathematician and computer scientist that assisted in correcting a single typo in the subsection ‘Calculations’ of my original white paper”, the new “Satoshi” recalled. “He did not author or co-author any part of ‘Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system’.”\nWright has been trying to patent many Bitcoin and blockchain related concepts. Recently, a company that Wright is associated with has bought his patents as part of a deal they are describing as the “largest acquisition in the Bitcoin and blockchain development space yet.”\nIn his answers on Quora, the Bali-based “Satoshi” also repeatedly shows support for the use of patents to drive technological innovation. This standpoint would be unpopular among many of the libertarian Bitcoiners who chose Bitcoin for its anti-state-monopoly features. In one answer, “Satoshi” details how he would make $100,000 in 6 months. His method involves submitting product design “with patent application to your country’s patent authority then make sales calls to large companies that have a mass market distribution outlet for your product or design.” In another answer, he advised: “Patenting your own products or `logical technology´ model” will offer the highest returns.”\nUpdate: The user’s information and answers have been removed on Quora.\nWhat do you think of this “Satoshi”?

    "text": "\n The infamous Multi-Level-Marketing (MLM) scheme and so-called ‘cryptocurrency’ Onecoin is under investigation once again. On April 10 the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority otherwise known as Bafin has frozen funds connected with a Onecoin payment processor.\nAlso read: NSA Exploits Reveal the World of 1984 Is Here\nGerman Regulator Bafin Freezes a Onecoin-Associated Company’s Assets \nA German-based company called the IMS International Marketing Services Gmbh is under scrutiny for accepting funds coming from the Onecoin organization. In a recent report, the German regulatory agency Bafin reveals they have seized funds in excess of €29m from the IMS firm. The agency states that IMS raked in a total of €360m from the MLM based company Onecoin Ltd., for over a year.\nBafin says Onecoin is part of a vast network of marketing agencies selling virtual units the company declares as a cryptocurrency. The financial regulator says the Onecoin MLM scheme is used in Germany and across the world by many people. However, Bafin calls IMS an “unauthorized money remittance business,” and the company is in violation of sentence 4 of the German Payment Services Supervision Act.\n“In its decree of 5 April 2017, BaFin ordered IMS International Marketing Services GmbH to immediately cease and wind down its unauthorized money remittance business with investors in “Onecoin” for Onecoin Ltd.,” explains the German supervisor’s office. \n\nIn case IMS should not abide by the order to cease business, Bafin threatened to impose a coercive fine of 1.5 million euros; for non-compliance with the winding-down order, it will also impose a coercive fine of 150,000 euros.\n\nInvestigations in Germany and All Over the World\nFor a highly detailed report on Onecoin’s sketchy MLM practices and proof the virtual token is not a cryptocurrency check out our popular Onecoin expose’ here.\nOnecoin and its associated companies have been under investigation in Germany before. Bafin started investigating Onecoin in June of 2016 due to solicited investments through the German bank Commerzbank AG. The bank is the second largest financial institution in Germany and may have accepted unauthorized funds from the MLM organization in the past. Furthermore, the alleged Ponzi scheme has been frowned on by government authorities in Belgium, Nigeria, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and many more countries.\nBafin says they don’t have the power to decide whether or not Onecoin tokens are valid under civil law. However, operations will be investigated says the regulatory agency and “orders may still be subject to judicial review.” Although they can’t legally define Onecoin’s business practices at the moment, Bafin can shut down unauthorized remittances.\n“On behalf of Onecoin Ltd, IMS International Marketing Services had investors who had bid to buy “Onecoins” and transfer the sales to various accounts held by IMS International Marketing Services with different banks in Germany and forwarded the money on behalf of Onecoin Ltd to third parties, based in particular outside of Germany. This kind of financial service is classified as money remittance business,” Bafin’s report details.\nWhat do you think about Bafin freezing a company’s assets with connections to Onecoin?

    "text": "\n This week all eyes are watching India as citizens are having trouble accessing cash reserves as ATMs run dry throughout the country. Alongside these troublesome economic times, bitcoin trading is increasing substantially in India, as the country is one of the hottest bitcoin regions in the world right now next to China and Japan.\nAlso read: Bitcoin Adoption in Thailand Led by Tourism Industry\nBanks and ATMs Run out of Cash Throughout India\nRight now there is significant demand in India for cash as banks and ATMs within the country are currently experiencing a shortage of physical notes. According to regional publications, some regions in India are reporting 90 percent of the local ATMs do not have cash. Sources in the country say the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has moved some of its cash reserves to certain areas within the country due to the recent elections.\nFurthermore, the State Bank of India (SBI) has revealed the cash crisis has caused customers to start losing confidence in the system because there is nothing local bank executives can do.\n“Nearly 70 percent of our 648 ATMs in the three districts are out of cash. The rest will also become dry in the next few days as we do not have cash to refill the machines. We are helpless from our side,” said the deputy general manager of SBI, Ajoy Kumar Pandit.\nATMs across India are “Out of Cash.”\nThe Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India\nThe Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India\nRecently some members of the Indian government have made some negative statements towards bitcoin, but it hasn’t slowed down cryptocurrency demand in India. Additionally, leaders within the region have formed a committee to investigate the cryptocurrency and will release a report on bitcoin in three months. A few days after the government committee formation, bitcoin startups within the region also created a coalition to discuss the subject with Indian officials.\nThe companies involved with the newly formed group called the “Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India” (DABFI) include Bitcoin-focused startups such as Zebpay, Unocoin, Coinsecure and Searchtrade.\n“We request the committee to give us an opportunity to meet them and showcase the benefits of this technology for our country,” explained the DABFI. “Financial inclusion, cheaper cross-border remittance, full trace and track on the movement of value on the blockchain network, and the potential for India to become a financial hub are key benefits that can be derived using virtual currencies.”\nBitcoin Demand Growing as Indian Traders Take in Profits\nAlongside cash demand, Bitcoin is doing phenomenally well in India, and there is significant market demand for the decentralized currency. Localbitcoins volumes in India are still very high with an average of 20,000,000 INR or $300,000 USD during the first week of April. Furthermore, price spreads across Indian exchanges are currently $50 higher than most global averages at the time of writing.\nMoreover, just like in China, bitcoin traders and enthusiasts are doing quite well in India trading bitcoin. According to a recent article from the Times of India, the decentralized cryptocurrency is becoming attractive because it can be used to move money across the world in a permissionless way. Benson Samuel, CTO, and founder of exchange Coinsecure has found customers are using the exchange for arbitrage. “One lady used to buy from our exchange, and within a few hours, sell it on another. That works because different exchanges have different prices,” explains Samuel.\nLocalbitcoins volumes during the first week of April hit an average of 20,000,000 INR.\nSpeculative Asset for Now\nAs cash reserves run dry in India, many citizens have found a safe haven and store of value with bitcoin. Right now most Indians look at bitcoin as an asset class and are waiting for the government to consider it a legal form of payment much like Japan’s recent rulings.\n“Like gold, Indians believe that to be an asset class, and its actual use case is only 1% of total transaction value. We believe that once Indian merchants get clarity on regulation and taxation of bitcoins, we will see them using it as a payment gateway,” Saurabh Agarwal, co-founder, and CEO of Indian Bitcoin exchange Zebpay adds.\nWhat do you think of the recent events in India concerning Bitcoin demand?

    "text": "\n The Bitcoin scaling debate affects some businesses more than others, but few real-world businesses have the volume to watch Bitcoin’s momentum react to it like the tourist hotspot, the Pattaya Beer Garden. Bitcoin.com discussed adoption trends in Thailand with Peter Noid, the proprietor of this large and popular restaurant and bar located in Pattaya, a resort city south-east of Bangkok.\nAlso read: Bitcoin Startups Challenging Big Banks Profits\nBitcoin Accepted at the Pattaya Beer Garden\nWith seating for 400 and “around 2,000 visitors a day,” the Pattaya Beer Garden started accepting bitcoin in early 2014 when the Thai government first eased its stance on Bitcoin’s legality. “I was an early Bitcoin supporter,” Noid told Bitcoin.com. “We started accepting it as soon as the Thai government said it was not illegal to do so.”\nIn 2013, the Thai central bank declared the use of bitcoin illegal in Thailand, but changed its opinion in early 2014 to make it not illegal. However, buying bitcoin in Thailand and then selling it outside the country was still strictly prohibited, Noid explained. The revised stance “enabled us to begin accepting bitcoin,” he recalled. While there is currently no official law governing Bitcoin in the country, the central bank’s opinion is revered, and early adopters there have had to tread lightly.\nThe Pattaya Beer Garden at night. (Photo/Albin Lageder)\nThe infrastructure for Bitcoin acceptance has grown but merchants are still very cautious to this day. “Bitcoin is well established in Thailand with a number of good local exchanges that have good liquidity,” Noid described. However, “merchant acceptance is very low. Just a few of us in Pattaya and a few more in Bangkok,” he added.\nNoid uses Bitpay for merchant processing. “We hold 100% in bitcoin. I have never cashed out,” he conveyed, noting that he has been a big believer in Bitcoin’s future. While only a small percentage of his business is currently done in bitcoin, it is still at a frequency far higher than most bitcoin-accepting establishments receive. The beer garden gets “on average 1 or 2 bitcoin transactions a day,” he revealed, adding that:\n\nI love the whole idea of Bitcoin and I am 100% convinced that merchants like me can do a lot to raise awareness.\n\nTo that end, Noid placed “we accept bitcoin” stickers predominantly around the premises which has led to “hundreds of inquiries about what the heck is Bitcoin.” This allows him to introduce many new people to the digital currency. “I enjoy doing that,” he said.\nTourism Industry Leads Bitcoin Adoption\nSanctuary of Truth, Pattaya, Thailand\n“Tourism is the 2nd biggest industry in Thailand and the biggest industry by far in Pattaya,” Noid noted. The beachfront town receives roughly 8 million visitors each year from every corner of the globe.\n“Bitcoin customers reflect that diversity although I would say Americans are probably the largest group of users we see,” he said. “On any day you could easily find visitors from 25 different countries at the Pattaya Beer Garden.” This makes the establishment one of the few places where one can watch global Bitcoin adoption trends in the wild on a daily basis.\nThe Pattaya Beer Garden. (Photo/Bill Pearson)\nThe beer garden is an expansive tourist spot in one of the most congested parts of the main Pattaya strip, with a dining area overhanging the water.\nThe tourist hangout is patronized by customers from diverse demographics. The group consists of “a lot of couples which are predominantly 40+ American and European males and 20+ Thai females,” Noid divulged. “Quite a few Thai family groups and younger foreign men as well.”\nHe sees a lot of young Russian couples and older Chinese men too, and it’s this latter group that he often sees paying in bitcoin. “There are not a lot of places you can do that in Thailand so it’s a novelty for a lot of Bitcoiners,” Noid conveyed. “I have personally met many of these people and had some great discussions.” The beer garden gets “a lot of visitors who come specifically to spend their bitcoin,” he added.\nWidespread Credit Card Fraud\nIn Thailand, like most countries, credit cards are widely known and accepted. “However a lot of tourists are reluctant to use [credit cards] because of fraud which is also well known here,” he explained, adding ATM fraud to the list of problems with the legacy financial system in Thailand. “For me, bitcoin is clearly the superior choice but of course most of our customers do not know that,” he said. “Bitcoin should be more widely adopted as it is so easy and safe for tourists.”\nThat’s why the Pattaya Beer Garden accepts zero-confirmation transactions for all bitcoin payments. “Any other choice would not be practical in a retail situation. We have never had one go bad and we have well over a thousand transactions,” he shared, illustrating the ample goodwill that still exists in the Bitcoin community.\nBitcoin Adoption Stalled\n“It [Bitcoin adoption] grew quite rapidly until the ‘don’t buy a coffee with Bitcoin’ meme grew as well,” he recalled. With a saddened heart, he added, “We have seen little growth in bitcoin transactions this past year.” In fact, he said:\n\nAdoption has ceased growing here.\n\n“Paying for your beer or coffee may not be an important economic function but it makes Bitcoin real in people’s minds,” Noid stated. In his view, the current impasse in the scaling debate is the culprit that is “doing immense harm” to Bitcoin adoption. Specifically, “high fees and long confirmation times are definitely impacting adoption. That saddens me greatly,” he admitted.\n“I was quite active getting other merchants to accept bitcoin here but I no longer advocate this,” he continued. “The present gridlock in Bitcoin is not something I wish to explain to potential merchant adopters.”\nNoid fully understands that Bitcoin “cannot scale on chain to Visa/Mastercard levels,” and contemplated “second layer solutions may well be the answer or any other of the myriad proposals.” However, he made his stance clear that Bitcoin needs a quick fix in the meantime. “While that gets sorted out we need to scale on-chain right now to allow adoption to continue increasing and create more customers for whatever other scaling solutions actually get implemented,” he said, adding that:\n\nRight here at the coal face of Bitcoin acceptance I can feel the momentum Bitcoin once had slipping away. I am very pissed off about that.\n\nDo you think the scaling debate is holding back other merchants like it does in Thailand? Let us know in the comments section below.

Currently, F2 Pool is the second largest mining operation behind Bitmain’s Antpool capturing 11 percent of the network’s hashrate. People have been focused lately on F2 Pool’s actions because many are curious to find out what scaling solution the pool supports.\n\nSo far figuring out whether or not F2 pool supports bigger blocks, or Segregated Witness (Segwit) has been quite confusing. From the signs of things and statements made, the mining pool would like to see both developments move forward. For instance, one vocal member of F2 pool, Wang Chun has been voicing his opinion on the subject for quite some time but in a very cryptic fashion. \nThen this week on April 18th the Chinese publication 8BTC’s forum revealed a translated statement from F2 Pool that announced the organization was in favor of Segwit, but the announcement also stated the pool wants a larger block size.  \n“Most people don’t realize that the debate is about what is best for bitcoin instead of choosing one specific scaling solution, Segwit, BU or other scaling solutions,” explains the mining pool’s announcement.\n\nAt F2Pool, we are in favor of Segwit plus a large block size. Segwit can help solve technical problems and a large block size is beneficial to the bitcoin ecosystem in the long run. But the hard fact is that we are not able to reach this goal under the current situation.\n\nCan We Really Determine What Scaling Solution F2 Pool Supports?\nWatching F2 Pool’s scaling signals when the pool mines blocks on the network has also been very confusing. The mining pool has signaled for Segwit but has also shown support for other proposals as well. A few weeks ago for an April Fool’s Day joke, the pool signaled for every proposal on the table including Segwit, Bitcoin Unlimited, Classic, and an 8mb increase. The pool also showed signs of supporting Segwit on the Litecoin network that day.\nF2 Pool’s Wang Chun told his Twitter followers that day, “Bitclub stole my idea for the upcoming April Fool’s Day. Let’s signal BU + SW + Classic + XT +8M all together!”\nWang Chun meets with Bitcoin Unlimited developer Andrew Stone in China this past March.\nWang Chun’s Twitter Statements\nFurthermore, Wang Chun has been revealing strong opinions about bitcoin development over the past few days. On April 18 Chun compared Core developers to Saddam Hussein winning 100 percent of the vote in 2002. “Core devs are no different from President Hussein IMHO,” explains Chun. The F2 pool associate goes on to say that the scaling debate is not about Segwit at all but more about development communication and listening. \n“It’s not about segwit or not,” says Wang Chun. “It’s about communicating, listening, understanding, and respecting. All those the things current Core devs lack.”\n\nThe pool has been signaling for Segwit for the past three days according to network statistic websites. It seems the mining pool is pleased with taking a more humorous approach and has no problem joking around about block size debate. However, as the saying goes many true words are said in jest. It’s clear Wang Chun has a lot to say about the scaling subject and believes Bitcoin development communication skills with miners needs improvement.\nWhat do you think about F2 Pool’s stance towards the scaling debate? Do you agree with any of Wang Chun’s recent statements towards developers? Let us know in the comments below.

    "text": "\n Ever since the new digital currency legislation was implemented in Japan, Bitcoin has become a hot topic within the region. Now the famous city of Hirosaki is accepting donations for its well known Cherry Blossom Festival that gathers millions of visitors each year.\nAlso read: Japan Declares Sale of Bitcoin Exempt from Consumption Tax\nCity of Hirosaki Accepts Bitcoin Donations to Help Preserve Thousands of Cherry Blossom Trees   \nOn April 20 the city of Hirosaki has announced it will be collecting bitcoin donations to help preserve its 2600 cherry blossom trees and the annual festival held at the end of the month. The news of Hirosaki city officials choosing to accept bitcoin donations was also reported on by the national Japanese broadcast NHK. The Japanese city is well known for the tree festival conducted around the Hirosaki Castle Park.\nThe festival has over 2 million visitors every year who observe the fifty types of cherry blossom trees in the city. However according to city officials taking care of the trees is costly and Hirosaki city officials have partnered with the Japanese exchange Coincheck to accept bitcoin donations.         \n“We expect bitcoin donations to be an effective approach to promote Hirosaki’s cherry blossoms and a castle especially to people living outside of Japan,” explains Hirosaki’s city committee. “We also expect bitcoin donations to be a unique tourism promotion. When it comes to more practical benefits, bitcoin donations require much lower initial cost and running cost compared to traditional methods.”\n\nA Great Opportunity to Attract Tourists from Overseas\nCity officials detail donations have always gone towards taking care of the thousands of trees alongside maintaining the 400-year-old Hirosaki Castle for future visitors. Bitcoin contributions will help preserve the trees and repair broken stone on the castle walls explains the Hirosaki city committee. Furthermore, the city said they will further investigate both positives and negatives concerning using bitcoin to facilitate donations.\n\nAs Hirosaki-city, we consider bitcoin donations a great opportunity to attract tourists from overseas. On the other hand, we are also going to conduct a search on disadvantages and discuss further possibilities.\n\nThe Japanese trading platform Coincheck who helped facilitate the deal with the city of Hirosaki has been on a mission promoting bitcoin in Japan since 2012. The firm has made headway in the region, and quite a few merchants use the service to accept bitcoin in their stores and restaurants.\n\nBorderless Donations \nJust recently Coincheck and the popular Japanese exchange Bitflyer announced both firms would help thousands of merchants in Japan accept bitcoin this summer. Coincheck is pleased to assist the city of Hirosaki to begin accepting bitcoin for the Cherry Blossom Festival donations and hopes other local Japanese city officials adopt the payment method.\n“Bitcoin allows accepting donations regardless of regions due to its borderlessness. As one of the largest bitcoin company, Coincheck will continue to promote bitcoin donation around the world,” the Japanese exchange stated.\nWhat do you think about the city of Hirosaki accepting bitcoin payments to help preserve the cherry blossom trees?

    "text": "\n The Bitcoin payments startup Abra has been busy adding to its service offering since Bitcoin.com reported on its progress in January. Abra users in the U.S. and the Philippines can buy bitcoin via their bank account or with cash. The list of supported banks has been growing fast. On Thursday, the company announced that over 60 U.S. banks and credit unions are now supported for both deposits and withdrawals.\nAlso read: Abra to Finally Launch Global Bitcoin Network Next Month\n60+ U.S. Financial Institutions Supported\nAbra users load money into the company’s smartphone app in two ways; with a bank account or with cash. The company started offering the option to buy bitcoin via bank accounts in early March, but only to users in the U.S. and the Philippines. There is no fee to add, send, or withdraw money from a bank account. Initially, only 17 U.S. banks were supported. However, on Thursday, the company announced the addition of many more U.S. financial institutions, stating that:\n\nOur latest update adds support for 46 new US banks and credit unions, bringing the total number of supported US banks and credit unions to 63.\n\n“In the U.S., these banks are supported for adding and withdrawing funds held in the Abra app,” the company’s website states. At press time, there are 34 banks and 29 credit unions supported. They include Bank of America, Capital One, Charles Schwab, Chase, Citibank, Commerce Bank, Fidelity, Suntrust, TD Bank, USAA, Union Bank, and Wells Fargo.\nIn the Philippines, adding funds to an Abra account can be done through only three banks: BDO Unibank, BPI, and Unionbank. Withdrawals can be done via most major banks, according to the Abra’s website, including Bank of Commerce, Citibank, HSBC, Metrobank and Union Bank. A full list of supported financial institutions for both the U.S. and the Philippines can be found here.\nWhat makes Abra unique, however, is its network of human tellers, which currently supports over 50 currencies globally. While users outside the U.S. and the Philippines will have to use bitcoin to add and withdraw money from the Abra wallet, a teller can give them their local currency. The company is currently working to build out its teller network so that users can cash in and out from anywhere around the globe. At the end of March, the company revealed that there are Abra tellers in over 100 different cities worldwide including over 1,500 locations in the Philippines.\nAbra users in the Bitcoin community are starting to describe on social media their experiences using the app. Reddit user “Pdubl” mentioned that he has tested out the new features successfully. “ACH transfer was relatively quick compared to Coinbase/Glidera, about 2-3 days,” he recalled and noted the new fee structure as well. He added:\n\nThe exchange rate seems to be about 1.5% but it’s built into the price. You also pay the BTC transaction fee when you withdraw.\n\nACH Transfer Limits, Rates, Time\nAbra advertises “No transfer fees. Low exchange rates” on its website. “There’s a $500 daily limit on ACH-based cash loads,” the startup also noted. Once the money is loaded into the Abra app, users can hold, spend and send bitcoin to other Abra users anywhere in the world, as well as receive it in their own local currency.\nThe company claims to offer “the least expensive ACH-based option for buying bitcoin today.” At launch, it used Coinbase for bitcoin price conversion but has recently changed to using Tradeblock’s XBX Index. “This will result in a conversion rate that more closely tracks the global average across institutional bitcoin exchanges,” Thursday’s announcement reads.\nIn addition, Abra is “running tests to shorten the amount of time it takes to add money via bank deposit from 2-3 business days to 1-2 business days,” the company also revealed on Thursday. “In some cases we may require additional verification to protect the security of our customers’ accounts, which could add more time.”\nOne of Abra’s main goals has always been to jumpstart the mass adoption of Bitcoin. In its recent statements, the company wrote: “Bitcoiners can now send bitcoin to pay people without having to explain Bitcoin.” In addition, “they won’t even know the sender sent them bitcoin. Recipients can then cash out their wallet balance to their bank account in any of our supported countries or find an Abra Teller nearby if they need or prefer to withdraw physical cash.”\nWould you use Abra?

This week, the startup Elliptic has announced a new monitoring tool and the company’s partnership with Silvergate Bank. According to Elliptic, the platform which the two firms designed will give financial institutions better insight into Bitcoin-related risks that don’t comply with current regulatory standards.\nFounded in 2013 by James Smith, Adam Joyce, and Tom Robinson, Elliptic has raised US$7 million since the company’s inception. Investors injecting money into Elliptic’s coffers include Digital Currency Group and banks like Santander.\nMoreover, the startup claims that it has already produced substantial evidence for law enforcement agencies worldwide.\n“Our proprietary database links millions of Bitcoin addresses to thousands of clear web and dark web entities,” Elliptic’s website details. “We back this up with transparent documentary evidence. We have delivered actionable evidence in cases involving international arms trafficking, money laundering, theft, and drug offenses.”\nThe company became well known when it introduced the “Bitcoin Big Bang,” a visualization tool that analyzes “the emergence over time of the largest entities on the Bitcoin blockchain, and their interconnectivity.”\nElliptic’s Bitcoin Big Bang\nRelying on Tools Rather than the Word of the Exchange\nThe latest tool from the London-based blockchain surveillance startup will help banks when dealing with Bitcoin-based companies in order to stay compliant with regulatory guidelines.\n“The banks that are working with Bitcoin companies really don’t have much visibility into how effective they are at handling the risk associated with Bitcoin transactions,” explained James Smith, the CEO at Elliptic.\n\nUntil now, they pretty much have had to rely on the word of the exchange or whoever says ‘we’re doing the best we can’.\n\nWill Banks Get Comfortable With Bitcoin?\nThe news comes at a time when banks have been known to stop working with Bitcoin companies like exchanges when it comes to accounts and operations like wire transfers. Over the past two weeks, quite a few bitcoin trading platforms have had issues dealing with financial institutions and their de-risking methods. Elliptic and Silvergate Bank believe giving banks better visibility will make things easier for both parties.\nThe Californian financial institution has bolstered Bitcoin for quite some time. The president and CEO of Silvergate Bank, Alan Lane, has been trying to get bankers to discuss the subject of digital currencies at California Bankers Association meetings. Furthermore, the bank has made connections with fifteen Bitcoin businesses and other members of the blockchain industry in order to further its goals. With a network of banking institutions and Bitcoin companies using Elliptic’s new tool, the two firms hope it will bring more confidence to financial incumbents dealing with the cryptocurrency. \nWhat do you think about Elliptic’s new tool that gives banks visibility to unsavory activity on the Bitcoin blockchain?

    "text": "\n Florida lawmakers are considering new legislation that aims to stop virtual currency dealers who participate in money laundering. The bill, sponsored by Miami-Dade Representative Jose Felix Diaz, has passed through the state’s House Appropriations Committee.\nAlso read: The One Man Supreme Court Bitlicense Battle Begins in Two Weeks\nFlorida Lawmakers Target Virtual Currency Money Laundering\nMonetary concealment and cryptocurrency is the latest topic for Florida legislators following the state’s money laundering lawsuit dismissal last year. The case involved Michel Espinoza, a man charged with illegal money transmission for selling $1,500 worth of bitcoins to undercover police. Espinoza’s case was dismissed because the judge considered bitcoins as a form of property. Miami-Dade officials are not pleased with the result of the Espinoza trial, and the state is appealing the judge’s decision.   \nNow a bill sponsored by local bureaucrats and the Miami-Dade Cyber Crime Unit will define bitcoin as a “monetary instrument” and criminals using “virtual currencies” can be prosecuted for money laundering charges.\n“The high-tech criminals of the 21st Century use virtual currencies like bitcoin to accumulate and hide the profits of their illegal activities,” explained Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle.\n\nThis legislation makes sure that traffickers and fraudsters can no longer try to use internet-based currencies to hide and move their ill-gotten gains.   \n\nNo Clear Bitcoin Definitions Across the U.S.\nIf the law passes, it will essentially add bitcoin to the current definitions of “monetary instruments” under Florida’s money laundering act. Current Florida statutes say “monetary instruments” are defined as coin, U.S. or foreign currency, and checks. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies do not fall into that category and that is the reason why the Miami-Dade judge dismissed the Espinoza case.\nEach U.S. state is trying to figure out whether or not bitcoin is considered a currency or commodity. Currently, there is no general consensus on which definition to use, and this has made legal issues difficult. For instance, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) defines bitcoin as a commodity or property. But in September of 2016, a federal judge based out of Manhattan declared bitcoin is money during a high-profile New York lawsuit.\nIn the New York criminal case against Anthony Murgio, Federal Judge Alison Nathan stated:\n\nBitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term — Bitcoins can be accepted as a payment for goods and services or bought directly from an exchange with a bank account. They therefore function as pecuniary resources and are used as a medium of exchange and a means of payment.\n\nMoney Laundering Intent Must Still Be Proven\nA South Florida-based attorney, Andrew Hinkes, says the new bill will not give prosecutors an advantage as they will still need to prove money laundering intent.\n“I don’t think it would affect the day-to-day users of bitcoin, or investors who hold bitcoin,” Hinkes explains to the Miami Herald. “But it might affect the business of those who exchange bitcoin for dollars. Now, assuming the facts support the intent required by law, the path to the prosecution of traders for money laundering is clearer in Florida.”\nThe Senate version of the new bill will be facing an appropriations committee vote in the near future, as the House appropriations version has passed unanimously.\nWhat do you think of the new virtual currency money laundering bill proposed in the state of Florida?

    "text": "\n In a talk given at the Africa Blockchain Conference on March 2 called “Blockchain vs. Bullshit: Thoughts on the Future of Money,” Andreas Antonopoulos provided clarity in regards to new “blockchain” projects that are emerging in the space that might be fraudulent. The purpose of his talk was to give insight on what constitutes the real deal and also clarify the motives of the fraudsters.\nAlso read: Litecoin Reaches Round Table Resolution for Protocol Upgrade\n\nHe said, “How can you tell…blockchain or bullshit? They both start with a ”B,” what’s the difference? If you can replace the word blockchain with database and the brochure reads the same, it is business as usual. It is not decentralized. It is not borderless, neutral, censorship-resistant, open. It reestablishes trust in intermediaries. It’s just a database, and that is not disruptive.”\nFrauds Will Be Naked on the Beach\nAndreas Antonopoulos\nIn his typical eloquent fashion, Antonopoulos said when the tide recedes, these charlatans and frauds will be left standing naked on the beach. They will have left their bathing suits at home, along with their integrity and dignity. They will be disrobed for all to witness. Of course, this is what happens when nonsense is gift-wrapped and pawned off as blockchain technology.\nHe clarified, ““There is a lot of bullshit being peddled to VC’s to investors, to initial coin offering buyers, to uneducated investors. There are a lot of Ponzi schemes, there are a lot of pyramid schemes, and a lot of empty promises. There is also a lot of business as usual disguised as innovation, disguised as disruptive technology.”\nAntonopoulos said the bankers, central planners, and other parties will especially attempt to defraud people and claim their pseudo-innovations are amazing blockchain revelations.\nIn other words, these are the vultures who want people to trust them rather than trust the real decentralized, peer-2-peer trustless networks. In an impassioned and explosive statement, Antonopoulos decimated these hucksters:\n\n“Trust us? These banks. Where were you in 2008. Where were you when Libor was fixed. Where were you when the gold markets were fixed? Where were you when front-running and high frequency trading was creating these monsters of crony capitalism? Trust us? Hell no. Removing the clearinghouse and replacing it with…what’s the word? It’s not consortium…CARTEL, that’s the word. With a cartel of the same market makers who have manipulated and compromised every market in history. And doing that in a way that closes it from transparency. That is not a recipe for efficiency, mutability, and transparency. That is not a blockchain. It is bullshit.\n\nLesson of the Day\nWhat Antonopoulos said to beware of is people promising *currently* impossible things with Blockchain technology, such as massive retail sales, and other forms of fully functional markets or banks on the blockchain.\nHe did not specify any of the fraudsters or make any specifics claims about who may be a culprit. His point was not to level attacks against anyone specific. It was merely to testify that the forces of evil are everywhere, and they will do anything to thwart decentralization, financial independence, and ultimately, the blockchain.\n\nDo you believe there a lot of fraudulent projects already in the blockchain space?

Promising that the strategy will soon be published for public consultation, he said:\n\nWe must be on the frontline in embracing blockchain and Bitcoin…we must be the ones that others copy.\n\nIn February, Bitcoin.com reported on Muscat’s proposal for the EU to become the “Bitcoin continent.” At this conference, the prime minister reiterated his position. He, once again, called for the EU to harness the potential of Bitcoin and seek to become the “Bitcoin continent of Europe”.\nMalta’s Strategy to Attract Investors\n“Having a strategy would encourage investors to come here. Malta could be a trailblazer in this sphere,” the Times of Malta reported Muscat as saying. “We need to be a frontline country when it comes to this innovation; we cannot wait for the regulators to reach their conclusions and then have to copy what other countries are already doing.” In addition, he explained that “the island also needed to look at adopting cryptocurrency, in spite of the wariness of regulators.”\nSilvio Schembri, Malta’s MP\nTheo Dix, an EY consultant, said, “if Malta develops a legal framework, blockchain technology companies would be encouraged to come here.” EY (formerly Ernst & Young) co-hosted the conference.\nHis sentiment is echoed by the chairman of the Economic and Financial Affairs Committee, Labour MP Silvio Schembri. He estimates that if Malta can attract even 1 percent of the UK’s fintech post-Brexit, “it would mean an injection of €200 million into the local economy.” He wants Malta to have “the world’s best environment for the development and commercialisation of fintech models and disruptive innovation,” thus fulfilling his dream for the country to become the “the Silicon Valley of Europe”, Malta Today reported.\nOther than the regulatory framework, Schembri believes Malta already has the right geographical position and weather conditions, as wall as “strong financial system, skills base, entrepreneurial spirit and can-do approach”. All these factors make his country a perfect test-bed for fintech companies. He added:\n\nThe government should ensure that Malta has the appropriate regulatory framework, the right tax system and the best infrastructure to support this ambition.\n\nWhat do you think of Malta’s strategy to embrace Bitcoin?

    "text": "\n With all different types of digital money these days and accounts represented electronically, people often wonder what’s the difference between traditional electronic currency issued by banks and permissionless cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\nAlso read: Why All Central Banks’ E-Currencies Will Fail Horribly\n \nThe Big Push for a Cashless Society\nOver the past few years, there’s been a lot of discussion concerning the world’s progression towards a cashless society. Furthermore, bureaucrats and government authorities worldwide have also bolstered the idea further by removing individual notes of tender from circulation by demonetizing cash reserves. Before the seventies, cash was a dominant form of money, but since then most people now transact with an electronic representation of their local currency in their day to day lives.\nFor instance, only 8 percent of the world’s money is represented by physical notes, and everything else is a form of digital fiat. Countries everywhere around the world have slowly been progressing towards a cashless society. In the U.S. the practice of electronic deposits into bank accounts became popular in 1975, and a decade later people were using these balances with debit cards.\nNow throughout a few particular countries, large denominated notes like the $100, $500, and $1,000 bills are becoming rarer as governments are removing them from circulation. One country, in particular, India is suffering from a cash crisis as leaders started a demonization process last year. The use of cash within India is becoming less visible as Indian authorities are pushing hard for a cashless society by replacing it with digital fiat.\nThe Glaring Differences Between Electronic Fiat and Cryptocurrencies\nThere are significant differences between the traditional digital currency in your bank account and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. One of the biggest contrasts between the two is bitcoin’s deflationary attributes which is backed by the currency’s 21 million capped supply. Many economists believe this is a great benefit as the public knows that there are only so many bitcoins, which causes people to save, and purchasing power usually increases.\nWith traditional digital fiat reserves, there is no telling how much money is circulating, and no one knows if the central banks are printing money on a whim. Economists who are against this type of monetary practice, such as those from the Austrian school, believe the world’s citizens are experiencing a silent robbery called inflation due to central planners printing vast amounts of fiat reserves. Sometimes central bank’s like the Federal Reserve tell the public they are creating more money with concepts like quantitative easing and the recent bank bailouts.    \nAnother reason the world’s traditional fiat currencies are no good is because the electronic form is also used to monitor the public’s wealth. Cash is harder to track, and governments can keep a keen eye on funds moving around their electronic databases. Furthermore, other government agencies such as the UK’s GCHQ, the NSA, the FBI, and the CIA have been known to being spying on citizens and the world bank’s monetary movements.\nWith this power, central authorities can censor people’s privileges to move money in any way they see fit. There are clear examples of banks, credit card companies, and Paypal freezing peoples funds or halting operations because of reasons they don’t particularly agree with.\nCensorship Resistance and Unstoppable Tax Protests\nWith bitcoin, people can move their wealth in a permissionless way using their individual sovereignty. Bitcoin users can utilize the decentralized currency for operations that are typically frowned upon by third party forces. This includes online storefronts selling pornography, illicit drugs, and other black market activities. Cryptocurrencies can also be used to avoid taxation as it leaves the decision of reporting to tax officials up to the user.\nThe infamous whistleblower Edward Snowden has agreed with this sentiment explaining to his Twitter followers on November 13 stating;\n\nCoincidentally, new technologies raise the possibility of unstoppable tax protests.   \n\nBecause the public is embracing bitcoin and blockchain-based permissionless currencies authorities worldwide are trying to co-opt the technology. Rather than be disrupted, central monetary planners believe adding the word “blockchain” to the incumbent databases used today will lure more people towards a cashless society. One that will still be monitored, controlled with censorship, and even “editable” for those trying to erase fraudulent behavior.\nThere is a big difference between the electronic money used by banks today and bitcoin, as the latter is far superior for those who embrace freedom.\nWhat do you think about electronic fiat currency in comparison to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin?

    "text": "\n This past week a South Korean bitcoin exchange called Yapizon was hacked for 3816 BTC or roughly $5.3 million USD worth of bitcoins on Saturday, April 22. The exchange has made a statement concerning the hack and plans to offer an IOU token to its customer base to cover losses.\nAlso read: Bitcoin’s Price Moon Bound Breaking $1400 and Climbing\n3816 BTC Stolen From the Korean Bitcoin Exchange Yapizon\nAccording to the bitcoin exchange Yapizon, four of the company’s hot wallets were compromised on April 22, between 2:00 to 3:00 in the morning. Yapizon says roughly 36 percent of funds were stolen and they have filed a complaint with the Cyber Investigation Division of Seoul, the local police. After the hack, Yapizon says they have spoken with their legal team and have decided to split the loss among its customer base.   \n“After many discussions, legal and accounting consultations and reviews, we have come to the conclusion that it should be applied fairly to all members,” explains the Yapizon exchange. “It is also the most common way to go through the liquidation process.”\nThe trading platform details that they are not spreading losses to KRW accounts but only virtual holdings including BTC, ETH, and LTC. Yapizon says executives and the CEO have relinquished property rights to resolve the case and will be paying its members with a token called “Fei.” Furthermore, the Korean exchange says they will also provide customers the opportunity to trade the Fei into shares of Yapizon’s “Yahoo Japan” stock.  \nA Bitfinex Precedent?\nAfter hearing the news, many bitcoin proponents were dismayed to hear the exchange was using the same IOU method Bitfinex used this past summer. According to Bitfinex, the company has reimbursed all of the losses from the breach in August. However, many bitcoiners commenting on the Yapizon issue say that Bitfinex has created a dangerous standard for hacked exchanges. Even the Korean exchange details that Bitfinex had set a precedent for their decision.   \n“There is a precedent,” details Yapizon’s theft announcement. “The largest Bitcoin trading company in the world, known as Bitfinex in Hong Kong, was hacked in August 2016 and suffered a loss of 120,000 bitcoins (about 22 billion won), and its assets were down by about 36%.\n\nAfter temporarily issuing coupons equivalent to the amount of the damage to members, it has become a bigger company now, and it has removed the loss by repurchasing the coupon from its members every month.\n\n ‘Fei’ Distribution Process Time Frame Not Disclosed\nThe exchange is a relatively small trading platform amongst larger exchanges in the South Korean region like Bithumb, Korbit, and Coinone. Yapizon doesn’t detail any more information about the incident, and the exchange does not seem to be operational. The Korean company does give details on the Fei distribution process but does not disclose when that will happen.\n“We are sorry to have caused an economic loss to you,” Yapizon adds. “We will do our utmost to maximize profits for our members by minimizing the loss and increasing the price of ‘Fei’ through the growth of our company and growing our shareholder value.”\nWhat do you think about the Yapizon exchange hack?

    "text": "\n Bitcoin is growing in popularity in Africa particularly in regions such as Kenya, Nigeria, and Ghana. This week the Hong Kong-based Bitspark has launched a remittance service to Nigeria at rates 14.4 percent better than competitors, by leveraging the speed and efficiency of the Bitcoin network.\nAlso Read: U.S. Government Cracks Down on Illegal Bitcoin Money Transmitters\nBitspark Offers Cheaper Remittances by Leveraging the Bitcoin Blockchain\nThe startup Bitspark is a cryptocurrency-financial services provider servicing the Asia-Pacific region and now countries located in Africa. The company has created an end to end remittance service powered by the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitspark says they will focus on Nigeria first as the country has the largest population and economy within the African continent. According to statistics, Nigeria has received an annual US$21 billion in remittances from countries across the globe.\n\nBitspark details that its newly launched Nigerian payment service will save people transaction costs as the company believes it is far cheaper than remittance competitors.\n“For every one dollar you send to Nigeria you’ll receive $0.14 more than if you use a competitor’s offer which at the end of the day can work out to be hundreds of dollars to the average transaction,” explains Bitspark.\n\nThis is made possible by using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the payment method without the need for banks. This is a great benefit to the end user receiving the money and Nigeria as a whole ensuring more money makes its way into the hands of the people which in turns helps develop the rapidly growing economic prospects of the nation.\n\nSignificant Interest Stems from South African Countries\nNigeria, Ghana and South Africa are interested in bitcoin the most according to Google Trends.\nSouth African countries are embracing bitcoin as Google Trends points out significant interest is arising from Nigeria and Ghana. Furthermore, according to a research report from the wallet provider Luno, concerning South Africa, bitcoin is attractive to citizens within the country. Luno’s report also details that 66 percent of South Africans surveyed say they trust bitcoin. 12.9 percent of responses say South Africans are using it for faster payments but 39.6 percent of those surveyed are holding bitcoins as an investment vehicle.\nOver 66 percent of South Africans surveyed trust bitcoin according to Luno research.\nOther Bitcoin-Based Payment Service Startups Are Targeting the African Continent\nOver 39 percent of South Africans surveyed believe in bitcoin as an investment and performing asset according to Luno research.\nJust recently the payment platform startup Bitwala announced a new service offering bitcoin-to-M-Pesa transactions at zero cost. Bitwala customers will be able to utilize the service to send funds to friends and family members in Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Tanzania free of charge.\nOther companies focused on bitcoin remittance applications in Africa are also making headway in the region. Last month the African payment services provider Bitpesa partnered with the bitcoin-based lending platform Bitbond. In order to make cross-border lending possible both companies utilize the bitcoin blockchain for faster, more efficient payment processing.\n“This means that a small business owner from Kenya can receive loan funding from investors from all over the world via Bitbond and have the funds paid out to his mobile money account in 20 minutes,” explains the founder of Bitbond Radoslav Albrecht. “This is an unprecedented level of innovation and convenience in the entire online lending space.”\nBitcoin-centric businesses are focusing in on Africa, and the South African region as cryptocurrency interest is growing fast.\nWhat do you think about bitcoin’s success in Africa and the South African region?

She said:\n\nThe euro has protected no one, quite the contrary. The euro has been a deadweight for prices, a deadweight for jobs, a deadweight for the competitiveness of our businesses and it would be much simpler to kick-start the economy without this common currency.\n\nFrance’s presidential candidates\nOn Sunday, May 7, the French people will cast their final vote in the country’s presidential election. Two candidates remain out of 11 from the first round; Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron.\nThe far-right Le Pen is in favor of Frexit. She wants to replace the euro with a basket of new national currencies, and even considers capital controls. Her opponent, Macron, is a centrist who is in favor reforming the EU to avoid Frexit.\nLe Pen has reportedly spoken against Bitcoin to the point of suggesting banning the cryptocurrency. Macron, however, supports experimentation and the use of blockchain technology.\nFrexit Could Boost Bitcoin’s Price\nThe effect of Frexit on Bitcoin could bear a resemblance to how Brexit affects the digital currency after Britain voted to leave the EU in June last year. “Brexit offers an opportunity for the UK to become a hub for cryptocurrencies if it tries to reposition itself as an innovation economy,” Bob Swarup, a principal at Camdor Global Advisors, told The Telegraph.\nWith the upcoming election, France’s future looks uncertain, similar to Brexit and Trump’s victory in the U.S., according to European Bitcoin startup Bitwala. “If the situation feels a little bit like a deja vu, this is because it is.”\nThe startup noted that “the price of bitcoin experienced a 25% hike from the day before Brexit to the next,” adding that:\n\nThe uncertainty regarding the value of Euro and Franc would increase demand in the cryptocurrency the following day of the Frexit referendum.\n\nOperating in over 120 countries with over 20 currencies, Bitwala claims to have over 25,000 users. The company offers remittance services using Bitcoin.\n“Hundreds of thousands of workers and immigrants currently residing in France are sending billions across borders to support their families with remittances,” the startup detailed. “Percentage of deposits and money transfer fees could eat directly into the savings of many affected families.”\nBitcoin “could play a vital role upon the possible withdrawal of France’s withdrawal from the European Union and the reintroduction of the Franc,” Bitwala believes, adding that:\n\nIf France does pull a Frexit, Bitcoin will experience a surge beyond record levels in terms of price.\n\nDo you think Frexit will happen and how will it affect the price of bitcoin?

    "text": "\n The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published last week a Bitcoin-related patent application by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc (CME). It describes clearing systems for “physically settled” digital currency derivatives contracts, including bitcoin.\nAlso read: Bitcoin Investment Trust Raises Offering to $1 Billion, Signs on Credit Suisse and Wedbush\nCME’s New Patent Application\nCME is an American financial and commodity derivative exchange based in Chicago. Today, it is the world’s largest options and futures contracts exchange, based on the number of contracts outstanding.\nThe company filed a patent application titled “System for Physically Delivering Virtual Currencies” with the USPTO on November 4, 2015. It was then published on the agency’s website on May 4.\nThe inventors listed on this patent application are Ryan Pierce, Sandra Ro, and Mansoor Ahmed. According to CME:\n\nThe present invention relates to systems for clearing derivative contracts based on virtual currencies and, in particular to systems that allow for the physical delivery of virtual currencies without the clearing counter-party directly possessing the virtual currencies.\n\nThe aforementioned derivative contracts include common futures and options contracts, CME details. In addition, the company specifies that “the virtual currency comprises bitcoin” without naming other cryptocurrencies.\nLast month, the USPTO published another Bitcoin-related patent application by the company. The patent for “Derivative Contracts that Settle Based on a Virtual Currency Difficulty Factor or an Index of Virtual Currency Generation Yield” was filed in October 2015 but published in April this year.\nBitcoin Poses a Clearing Challenge\nIn its patent filing, CME claims the needs for new systems and methods for transactions involving digital currencies including bitcoin, citing that these assets “can be transferred pseudonymously”.\n“Some types of futures contracts are ‘physically’ settled” where the actual commodity is delivered by the relevant counter-party at final settlement, the company explains, adding that:\n\nA clearing counter-party could facilitate physical delivery of virtual currency contracts by instructing the sellers of expiring contracts to transfer the virtual currencies directly to the clearing counter-party, and the clearing counter-party would then transfer the virtual currencies to the buyers.\n\nHowever, digital currency transactions “cannot be reversed without the consent of the recipient,” CME wrote, noting that “computer security breaches or employee dishonesty” could result in permanent loss of these assets. Furthermore, holding them “for settlement of derivatives contracts at a clearing counter-party presents a tempting target for thieves” and storing them also carries unique risks requiring specialized security procedures. The company believes:\n\nVirtual currencies, such as bitcoin, create challenges for clearing counter-parties.\n\nAfter outlining many risk factors, CME asserts that “there is a need in the art for improved systems and methods for clearing derivative contracts based on virtual currencies while minimizing risks to clearing counter-parties.” The patent describes “systems and methods that allow a clearing counter party to confirm that virtual currency has been physically delivered without taking possession of the virtual currency,” the company details.\nWhat do you think of CME’s new patent?

Florida legislators believe money launderers and other cyber criminals have been taking advantage of antiquated laws. They wanted to update them in the hopes of thwarting and undermining online financial crimes. In this regard, they have decided to call bitcoin a “monetary instrument.”\nThe Miami Herald article quoted one of the law makers,\n‘Cyber criminals have taken advantage of our antiquated laws for too long,’ said House Rep. Jose Felix Diaz, R-Miami, who sponsored the bill. ‘Bitcoin bypasses the traditional banking system, and our state’s laws simply had not caught up to the upsurge in criminality in the world of cybercurrency.’\nCase Dismissal in Florida\nJamie Redman, writing for bitcoin.com, covered the reasons why Florida lawmakers have come down so hard on bitcoin’s alleged use in cyber crimes.\nLast year a “money laundering” case was dismissed by a judge, because bitcoin was defined as property rather than money. The case involved a man named Michel Espinoza who sold $1,500 worth of Bitcoin to an undercover cop.\nRedman said, “Espinoza’s case was dismissed because the judge considered bitcoins as a form of property. Miami-Dade officials are not pleased with the result of the Espinoza trial, and the state is appealing the judge’s decision.”\nBitcoin Legal Quagmire\nThe overarching theme across the United States with bitcoin is legislators do not know how to properly define it. They cannot decide whether to call it a money or commodity. This misunderstanding has led to a situation where people have been able to successfully use bitcoin to “launder money.”\nThe IRS has officially said that bitcoin is property or a commodity.\nWill Florida politicians effectively stamp out crypto-based money laundering?

    "text": "\n The Australian government has renewed its commitment to end bitcoin double taxation in response to the Productivity Commission’s Inquiry. It has been over a year since Treasurer Scott Morrison made the promise to act quickly on changing the country’s goods and services tax (GST) law.\nAlso read: Australia’s Law to End Double Taxation of Bitcoin Stalled\nEfforts Renewed\nMichael Mccormack MP\nBitcoin.com recently reported that the Australian government’s efforts to change the GST law to end the double taxation of bitcoin were stalled. While this issue was a priority last year, according to the Australian fintech industry, it has not been one this year.\nHowever, that may be changing based on a report released on Thursday by the Australian Minister for Small Business, Michael Mccormack MP. The 37-page report outlines the Government’s response to the “Inquiry into Business Set-up, Transfer and Closure” launched by the Productivity Commission. The role of this government’s independent research and advisory body is to help governments make better policies for the Australian community. The report reads:\n\nThe Commission found that restrictions on new business entry come in many forms. Governments, at all levels, should identify and reform restrictions that are deliberately or inadvertently anti-competitive.\n\nAreas such as taxation, including the GST tax, “is a major concern” for businesses, the report notes, adding that these factors “can dissuade new business entrants, stymie business expansion or hasten closure.”\nBitcoin Recommendation Has Government’s Support\nThe Commission put forth a list of recommendations to which the government responded in four ways. It either supports the recommendations fully, supports “in principle” only, notes the recommendations, or does not support them altogether.\nOne of the Committee’s recommendations states:\n\nDigital currencies, such as bitcoin, should be treated as a financial supply for GST purposes. This would require that the definition of money be updated to include digital currency in both Division 195 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth) and relevant GST Regulations.\n\n“The Government supports this recommendation,” was the response to the above statement. The report further clarifies that “the Government agrees that consumers should not be subject to the GST twice when using digital currency to purchase goods or services.”\nAmending GST Act is a Fintech Priority\nIn March last year, the government released the Backing Australian Fintech statement to address the double taxation of digital currencies. It also established a Fintech Advisory Group “to advise the Treasurer directly on issues important to Australia’s fintech industry, such as identifying areas of potential future reform, and ensuring that the specific priorities of the industry are considered in the implementation of government policies.”\nOne of the fintech priorities outlined in this report was to amend the GST Act of 1999 to recognize bitcoin as money. The government acknowledged the recommendation and also suggested that “AML/CTF laws should apply to digital currencies.”\nThursday’s report confirms that “the Government is working with the Fintech Advisory Group on options to reform the current GST treatment of digital currencies.” However, “any change to the GST treatment of digital currencies is subject to formal state and territory agreement,” the report concludes.\nWhen do you think the Australian government will finally end bitcoin double taxation?

Many bitcoin proponents believe the state is becoming an innovative region as Vermont authorities have crafted quite a few bitcoin and blockchain friendly statutes.\nVermont’s latest amendment clearly defines bitcoin and alternative digital currencies as a “means of stored value that can be a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and store of value. Has an equivalent value in money or acts as a substitute for money and also may be centralized or decentralized.”\nAs far as virtual currencies are concerned “permissible investments shall be held in trust for the benefit for the purchasers and holders of the licensee’s outstanding payment instruments and stored value obligations,” explains Vermont bill 182.\nVermont Laws Considered Bitcoin and Blockchain Friendly\nLast year former Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin also progressed the state’s legislature with an economic bill that applies to all blockchains. The bill H.868 recognizes any fact, document or record certified on a blockchain which can be legally admissible in a court of law. The legislation detailed these types of records are deemed as “authentic” within business and litigation matters. The state of Arizona has a similar bill in motion which aims to legally recognize blockchain based digital signatures and smart contracts.\nVermont bill 182 furthers the state’s friendly nature towards cryptocurrencies as traditional businesses must hold a degree of permissible investments. Now if a company chooses they can hold bitcoin or another digital currency, but “only to the extent of outstanding transmission obligations received by the licensee in an identical denomination of virtual currency.”\nCurrently, there are roughly nine states working with digital currency and blockchain-related legislation. U.S. lawmakers that are implementing laws towards cryptocurrency users and businesses include representatives from Florida, Vermont, Arizona, North Dakota, California, Illinois, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Nevada, and Maine. Furthermore, a new congressional blockchain group has been created to further research for laws created on the Federal level.\nWhat do you think about Vermont’s law that allows money transmission businesses to hold bitcoin as a permissible investment?

    "text": "\n The Bitcoin ecosystem is thriving as the decentralized network continues to break new records in 2017. This month the Bitcoin network’s hashrate surpassed over four exahash per second adding one more milestone to the record books.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Startups Believe Africa Is Fertile Ground for Crypto-Solutions\nBitcoin’s Hashrate Crosses Four Exahash\nThe bitcoin mining environment has grown massive with many participants and pools competing to process transactions so they can earn fresh new bitcoins. The mining process has evolved from individuals mining on their computers at home to mega-sized data facilities located all around the world filled with thousands of machines.\nOver the past year and four months, bitcoin’s hashrate has entered the exahash era as the network processed one exahash per second in January of 2016. Now the miners’ collective hashrate is over four exahash per second or 4,216,797,036 GH/s, surpassing the most powerful supercomputers in the world.\nBitcoin Hashrate according to Blockchain.info May 8, 2017.\nAn exahash solves 10^18 hashes (problem-solving with algorithms) per second which means the network’s hashrate is processing beyond exascale computing speeds at over four quintillion hashes per second. According to research, exascale computing technology will grow exponentially in 2018, and the bitcoin network became one of those technologies when it surpassed 1.5 exahashes per second in mid-2016. The introduction of new mining chips and the growth of mining pools has led many people to believe bitcoin is the most secure computational network in history.\n\nMining Revenue Is up, Network Difficulty Is High, and There Are More Pools Than Ever Before   \nBitcoin’s rise in fiat value has helped push mining to new levels over the past year. According to statistics mining revenue is up more so than ever before as miners accumulate coinbase rewards and mining fees. However, network difficulty is also extremely high making it difficult for solo miners to make a profit without joining a pool. Bitcoin’s network difficulty is a measurement of how difficult it is for miners to find a hash below the given target. \nAn estimation of hashrate distribution amongst the largest mining pools according to Blockchain.info on May 8, 2017.\nMining pools have been around for quite some time, and a few years ago people thought hashrate distribution was too concentrated between a few pools. In particular, during the summer of 2014, Ghash mining pool breached the 51 percent threshold of hashrate distribution several times. However, in 2017 there are more pools than ever as there are currently roughly 22 pools commanding most of the mining power. No pool has more than 20 percent of the hashrate distribution, and there are only six significantly larger pools compared to all the others.\nBitcoin’s Exponential Mining Power Securing the Blockchain’s Strength\nLooking at Bitcoin’s hashrate compared to other altcoins using proof-of-work one can see that Bitcoin’s processing power is exponentially larger. For instance, the Litecoin network’s hashrate is 5,695 GH/s, Ethereum’s is 23766 GH/s and the hashrate for the Dash network is 1,252 GH/s. The processing power of the Bitcoin network is leaps and bounds larger than all three of these alternative networks combined. Making Bitcoin’s distributed ledger not only the longest running, but also considered by many as the most secure blockchain on the face of the earth.\nWhat do you think about the Bitcoin network’s hashrate surpassing four exahash per second?

    "text": "\n Following the inspections by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) which started in January, Chinese bitcoin exchanges halted bitcoin withdrawals. Now that the inspections are near completion, regulators are reportedly preparing to issue regulatory guidelines for all bitcoin trading platforms in China. These documents are expected to be released in June and withdrawals could soon follow.\nAlso read: ‘Rectification Plan’ for Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges Leaked\n‘Notice of Administrative Punishment’\nThe on-site inspections of Chinese bitcoin exchanges are near completion, reports Caixin on Wednesday.\nThe regulators will soon issue a “Notice of Administrative Punishment” to each of China’s three largest bitcoin exchanges, according to a translation by Cnledger on Twitter.\n“This type of notice is issued by government departments to those who did not break the laws but violated certain rules or regulations. In many cases, fines are incurred,” Cnledger explained. Okcoin, Huobi, and Btcc “will be facing a penalty of an unknown amount,” local Chinese publication 8Btc wrote.\nTwo Regulatory Documents Expected in June\nLast month, Bitcoin.com reported on a leaked document of the Chinese government’s “rectification plan” for bitcoin exchanges.\n8Btc reported on Wednesday that rectification requirements and inspection findings were used to compile two regulatory documents. The “management guidelines” and “AML guidelines” for bitcoin exchanges are expected to be released in June, the publication detailed, adding that:\n\nAccording to the inspection findings, the relevant administrative penalty resolution has been drafted and the paper is being reviewed. Two key issues must be corrected: one is the fiat and BTC lending business and the second is the flawed AML system.\n\nHow the Ordeal Began\nThe on-site inspections of Chinese bitcoin exchanges began in January. The following month, major Chinese exchanges announced the suspension of bitcoin withdrawals for one month, only to extend it longer. The exchanges have claimed the withdrawal suspensions are necessary while they develop and upgrade their systems to comply with regulations. They have also suspended margin trading.\nFollowing the inspections of major bitcoin exchanges, the PBOC started inspecting smaller ones. The bank also reportedly suggested extreme measures for all Chinese bitcoin exchanges to follow including in-person verification for account opening and other extensive customer verifications.\nMeanwhile, the bank has put together a list of rules for bitcoin exchanges to follow. Withdrawal suspensions and other major changes were speculated as being orders from the PBOC; a theory which was confirmed in the leaked document in April.\nWhen will Withdrawals Resume?\nIn March, Bitcoin.com reported that Chinese bitcoin exchanges would not resume withdrawals until the AML rules have been clarified. Btcc, Huobi and Okcoin separately said at the time that:\n\nSuspension will lift only after regulators approve internal compliance upgrades.\n\nAs the AML document and regulatory guidelines for Chinese bitcoin exchanges are expected to be released in June, “bitcoin withdrawal suspension could be removed subsequently,” 8Btc noted.\nDo you think withdrawals will resume in June?

The company also claims to be the first ewallet provider “to treat bitcoin like any fiat currency.” Merchants can now hold bitcoin in their accounts instead of having them automatically converted into fiat currencies. Furthermore, bitcoin payments are protected by Payza’s Resolution Center.\nAlso read: Early Version of Tumblebit-Enabling Hiddenwallet Released\nNew Bitcoin Services\nPayment technology company Payza helps more than 13 million members in over 190 countries and 26 currencies process online payments. Monday’s announcement adds cryptocurrency exchange services to the mix. The company announced:\n\nPayza, an award-winning global payment platform, today announced that it has become the first ewallet provider to treat bitcoin like any fiat currency.\n\nPayza began offering Bitcoin services to account holders in August 2014, starting with the ability to buy bitcoin using funds in their Payza accounts. In October that year, the company announced a service to allow users to sell bitcoin in order to fund their Payza accounts. Customers’ bitcoins were automatically exchanged into USD “at a competitive exchange rate that is updated in real-time,” the company noted.\nAdditional bitcoin services introduced on Monday include “instant bitcoin-fiat exchanges and the option to hold bitcoin alongside fiat currency within Payza ewallets.” Payza’s members can now hold bitcoins directly in their Payza ewallets, bypassing the need to have a separate bitcoin wallet to exchange between bitcoin and fiat currencies.\nBitcoin can now be sent and received between Payza members instantly just like fiat currencies such as the USD, euros, or sterling, the company details, adding that:\n\nThe fee to receive bitcoin is just 1.2% per transaction, which is lower than the standard Payza receiving fee of 2.9% + $0.30.\n\nBetter Bitcoin Payment Solutions for Merchants\nIn May 2015, Payza launched a bitcoin payment option for merchants to accept bitcoin payments. However, these payments were immediately converted and settled in USD. While their customers could pay in bitcoin before, merchants did not have the option to hold bitcoin as they were all automatically converted into fiat currency.\nNow merchants who use Payza for online payment processing will have the additional option of holding bitcoin they receive. The company details:\n\nMerchants will have the option to retain those payments in bitcoin in their ewallets until they choose to convert the funds themselves. Merchants will also have the option to set their prices directly in bitcoin without setting that price in a traditional currency like U.S. dollars.\n\nWhile Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, all purchases made in bitcoin through Payza’s online payment platform “will remain protected by Payza’s Resolution Center, a section within Payza accounts dedicated to resolving transaction disputes between buyers and sellers,” the company noted.\nFuture Plans\nAccording to Payza’s global executive vice president, Firoz Patel, more bitcoin and cryptocurrency features will be announced in the coming weeks and months. For example, Payza members will soon be able to exchange bitcoin in their Payza ewallets to instantly load their Payza Cards with U.S. dollars. He said:\n\nWe are on track to launch full cryptocurrency exchange services, providing current and future crypto-enthusiasts the ability to exchange dozens of cryptocurrencies, not just bitcoin, within their Payza accounts. \n\nWhat do you think of Payza’s new Bitcoin services?

This year there’s been a lot more homes for sale from individuals posting ads on public websites like Craigslist and bitcoin-based businesses that are specifically tailored to selling real estate.  \nAlso Read: Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Considers Bitcoin\nIndividual From Hong Kong Advertises a Brand New Vancouver Villa for 2099 BTC\nJust recently a person selling a brand new home in Vancouver announced that he was selling the US$3.5 million dollar house for 2099 bitcoins. The Hong Kong Craigslist post offers a nice Coquitlam home in British Columbia, Canada with all the fixings. The post asks for “serious inquiries only” and states the the house for sale is located in “one of the hottest markets on the planet.”\nThe ad made headlines across various news outlets speculating this was a sign of how Chinese citizens are bypassing cash outflows by purchasing real estate. The publications Zero Hedge and the Huffington Post propose this may be how Chinese investors are moving significant amounts of funds out of the mainland.\nCoquitlam home in British Columbia for sale on Craigslist. Seller says Ethereum is also accepted.\nPurchasing and Renting Properties With Bitcoin All Around the World\nAnother way a person can sell or buy a home for bitcoin is through the platform Bitcoin Real Estate. The platform is very similar to applications like Zillow and has quite a bit of real estate listings with prices denominated in BTC. Listing a home requires a simple registration process and buyers looking for a home can easily access the search settings that includes filters. Bitcoin Real Estate offers a variety of properties with a broad array of price ranges as some listings are just land and others can be million dollar homes.\nFor instance, for around 755 BTC ($1.3M) an individual can purchase a luxury villa in Thailand at the Sanctum in Chiang Mai. The property comes with Smart Home capabilities, an Italian stone kitchen, a saltwater pool, four car garage, and even a nuclear fallout shelter. If you don’t have deep pockets, you can also purchase land that doesn’t have a house on the property for 17.5 – 35 BTC. There are many cheaper properties that can be found on Bitcoin Real Estate from places like Costa Rica, Mexico, Scotland, India and more. The Bitcoin Real Estate platform has 23 pages of listings for sales and rentals all around the world. \nLuxury Thailand villa for sale at the Sanctum in Chiang Mai.\nA Place Where Bitcoiners Can Buy Extravagant Properties, Million Dollar Homes, and Even Fallout Shelters\nIndividuals looking for more lavish real estate listings for bitcoin can shop for a home on Bitpremier, a Washington DC headquartered market that sells luxury items. Bitpremier has been around since 2013 and currently has ten pages of ritzy properties for sale in the real estate section. Not all the homes cost millions as there are a few properties listed for a few hundred thousand dollars worth of bitcoin. For 88 BTC a person can buy a five-star three-floor penthouse in Acapulco with two bedrooms. The home has a private beach, and the previous owner purchased the home for $174,000 USD worth of bitcoins back in 2013.\nFor those looking to avoid a nuclear catastrophe Bitpremier also has fallout bunkers for sale as well.

    "text": "\n Everyone should be wary of scams on the mining hardware market. They seem to be proliferating. These scam sites possess a thinly disguised veneer of legitimacy. They appear authentic and honest. Without some technical acumen or knowledge of red flags to investigate, anyone can become a victim. \nAlso read: Ripple Market Capitalization Soars, Surges Past Ethereum\nPotential buyers are not the only victims, though. News organizations and other websites have unwittingly advertised hardware scams in their press releases, within news articles, and as popup ads on their pages—which puts more people at risk.\nFor instance, Cryptocoins News published a press release on May 15 purported to be placed by Knc Miner… but the company has harbored a questionable reputation ever since before their bankruptcy proceedings last year. Coinmarketcap.com also posted a random ad popup for Knc Miner, and Cointelegraph also published a version of the press release.\nPrior to delving more into this KnC mining quagmire, what are some potential hardware scams customers or news organizations should be knowledgeable about? What should customers and other organizations look for that demonstrates the mining emperor has no clothes? What are the red flags?\nPotential Hardware Mining Scammers and Red Flags\nThere are at least three potential hardware scammers currently lurking on the market with reputable and professional looking webpages. These include, Foxminers, Knc-Miner, and Ufominer.\nThe commonality among these hardware scams is they offer deals or technology that is too good to be true. Everyone who mines bitcoin, Litecoin, or any other cryptocurrency wants the best possible equipment for the most affordable price. However, buyers and other interested parties should be wary about these deals. There are several red flags that indicate these pieces of hardware probably do not exist and companies who purport to sell them are likely fictitious.\nFoxminers\nFoxminers said their equipment can mine both Scrypt and Sha 256. This is supposed to be the first dual-mining hardware. However, there is no known technology in existence, and no one has come forward with a machine running this capability.\nTheir website buy screen says, “Chip Quality: 28nm SHA-256 & Scrypt Dual ASIC Designed By FoxMiners.”\nJamie Redman, writing for bitcoin.com, also examined their fraudulent activities. He said, “Unfortunately for the company, according to a scam warning on the forum Bitcointalk.org users have found issues with Foxminers claims. For instance, the spec sheet provided for the FM9800-XD1112 is nearly identical to another mining chip called SFARAD explains a skeptic on the forum. The two specs were also compared on the website Draftable for a side by side comparison revealing lots of similarities.”\nEveryone be aware, though. Their website looks legitimate and professional, but they are not operating in a transparent manner. It appears they are merely leveraging a clever “grab quick cash by night” scheme.\nUfominers\nAnother elegant-looking hardware scam site goes by the name “Ufominers”. Their website says,\nThe main focus area of our company is the development of cryptohardware, creation of blockchain-based technologies and delivery of remote hardware access services.\nEven though the alleged company talks a big game, several organizations have come out to question the legitimacy of Ufominers. Educational site 99coins pointed out a Ufominers deal that was too good to be true.\nThey said, “their most powerful product is the Nekrosminer that has a whooping 85TH/s for just $4,800 (~$57 for 1 TH/s). For comparison, the most advanced known miner on the market today supplies around 14 TH/s for around $2,000(~$142 for 1 TH/s). So you can see why their offer would seem very lucrative.”\nThese types of pricing and power discrepancy red flags are one of the most common indicators of a scam on the market. Anyone interested in purchasing a mining rig should acknowledge these deceptions. This pricing-to-power red flag is why Ufominers is likely another fraudulent company feigning legitimacy.\nKnc-Miner\nThe Knc-Miner scam site is probably one of the most obvious scams to break into recent limelight. As mentioned, the “company” released a press article about the comeback of their business. Cryptocoins News has the press release headline as “KnC Miner Returns With Improved Mining Product for Sale!”\nHowever, the miner suffers from the same power-price discrepancy that acts as a red flag for a scam. The Knc website claims their new Titan hardware has double the speed of the old one. This using only 1 of the original 5 boxes needed to achieve half that speed with the original Titan.\nWe have increased the speed to 750 MHs, offering our customers the fastest specialized scrypt mining hardware.\nThis is an obvious scam to those with a keen eye. The most powerful miner coming out on the market is an Antminer that mines at the speed of 375 mh/s, and the purported 750 mh/s is just not possible with current technology for commercial mining.\nKnc Miner Quagmire, Organization Among Miners, and Staying Aware\nBitcoin.com also dug deeper into the Knc Miner scam quagmire and discovered the purported Swedish domain owner for the site has already turned it over to the police. The owner, Sten Oscarsson of Gogreenhost, runs Knc’s old data center after buying the bankruptcy estate, and tells Bitcoin.com he is calling for an organization among miners to help combat these types of scams within the ecosystem.\nThis, however, does not mean anything will happen to the “company.” It is now just widely understood the site is fake and based on the solicitation of fraudulent mining rigs. In this sense, all these similar scam sites are now being revealed as fakes.\nKey Takeaway: Staying Vigilant of Scams\nThe key takeaway from this information is everyone understands there are an alarming number of scam sites cropping up. Each one purports to sell mining hardware that functions beyond current technological means at ridiculously low prices, and each intends on taking their customers money without providing a product in return.\nCustomers must remain vigilant and watch for these types of red flags. Make certain the company is reputable and that it actually exists. Protect the pocket book. Stay wary and vigilant of scams. The fraudsters, charlatans, and crooks are everywhere.\nDo you know anyone who has been ripped off by a fraudulent mining hardware company? Tell us the story in the comments section below.

Since the announcement, quite a few bitcoin enthusiasts got upset with Bitpay for dealing with Bitmain and its founder Jihan Wu.\n\nI suggest anyone who uses BitPay, close your account. Boycott merchants who use them as well. This company deserves to die. https://t.co/mBWNAOJbPL\n— Alphonse Pace UASF (@AlpacaSW) May 16, 2017 Furthermore, there have been numerous forum posts, and Twitter comments calling for bitcoiners to boycott Bitpay. Bitpay founder Stephen Pair has noticed the conspiracy theories and detailed how the company partnered with Bitmain stating;\n\nI’ve enjoyed reading the conspiracy theories about our relationship with Bitmain — That relationship was initiated by me reaching out to them. I had very good conversations with them about the issues at hand and we found we had a mutual interest in developing a viable alternative to the various Bitcoin C++ clients.\n\n‘Conspiring With Bitmain to Make Bitcoin Better’\nBitpay founder and CEO, Stephen Pair.\nPair says at one time he didn’t believe in alternative clients to the original C++ code but has since seen a new light. He says the original codebase has improved but believes large C++ software can fold under its own weight over time. “We need alternatives, but in the past, we’ve decided we didn’t have the staff needed to sustain an alternative implementation and make it successful,” explains the Bitpay founder.\nThe alternative client Bcoin has been running in production for months and is the only alternative code that has been battle-tested by miners. The project Pair says, is an opportunity for Bitpay and fit the company’s technology stack. Bitmain had also seen potential in the Bcoin client, and Pair thought the partnership was a great way to “get a commitment to funding on a sufficient scale.”\n“So, I guess we are conspiring with Bitmain to make Bitcoin better,” details Pair.\nAddressing the Angst Towards Bitcoin Miners \nAnother thing Pair has noticed is a negative attitude towards bitcoin miners lately. Pair says the company has been “bothered” by this sentiment against miners. Since the scaling debate has become more contentious, bitcoiners have scorned miners for not supporting scaling solutions on both sides of the debate.\n“Bitpay’s success depends largely on miners providing a well-functioning network,” explains Pair. “We appreciate miners and we think they deserve to be treated better. If miners have an issue, we at Bitpay want to help identify the problem and find a solution.”\nThe Bitpay CEO says the company initiated the collaboration with Bitmain to address difficulties working with miners “head on.”\nWhat do you think about Stephen Pair’s statements about Bitpay’s relationship with Bitmain?

    "text": "\n The first document timestamping service for the Bitcoin blockchain, Proof of Existence, has been acquired by Bitcoin ASIC mining hardware manufacturer Canaan. The company has also retained the founder of Proof of Existence, Manuel Aráoz, as an advisor on future product development.\nAlso read: Veriphant Helps Enable Legal Proofs in the Bitcoin Blockchain\nThe Acquisition by Canaan\nFounded in 2013 and headquartered in Beijing, Canaan Creative Co. Ltd (Canaan) produces Bitcoin mining rigs, designs ASIC microprocessors and operates data centers.\nOn Sunday, May 21, the company’s Hong Kong-based subsidiary, Canaan.io, announced that it had acquired Proof of Existence from founder Manuel Aráoz. “The blockchain space offers us opportunities on the hardware side and on the services side,” said Xiangfu Liu, Canaan co-founder, adding that:\n\nWe make the hardware that secures the blockchain; and now with the acquisition of Proof of Existence, we will also build services on top of the tamper proof features of the blockchain.\n\nEarly this month, the company also announced that it had raised RMB300 million (approximately US$43 million) in a series A funding round. Its investors include Chinese hotel operator Jin Jiang International Group Co. Ltd, Chinese investment firms Baopu Asset Management Co. Ltd., and Tunlan Investment.\nThe funding will support Canaan’s “upcoming 7nm designs and to enter the AI [Artificial Intelligence] market with its first Knowledge Processing Unit (KPU),” the company revealed on Sunday. Its products can be applied in AI fields including smart home appliance, autonomous driving, voice interaction and image recognition.\nAvalon Mining Family\nAvalonminer 741\nCanaan is the company behind the Avalon mining family of hardware which produces ASIC mining chips and rigs. The line of hardware was launched in late 2012 and was the first to successfully pre-sell commercially available ASICs. Avalon mining rigs were sold and delivered before any other brands of ASIC bitcoin miners, even pre-dating the infamous Butterfly Labs brand, making it the oldest brand of Bitcoin mining equipment still in production today.\nWhen Avalon first debuted their then-powerful, 65 gigahash mining rigs on Ebay for $1,500, the response was so overwhelming that the last unit sold for over $20,000. Today, their 7.3 TH/s Avalonminer 741 sells for $715, as shown on Canaan’s website.\nProof of Existence\nProof of Existence was another historic debut for Bitcoin. Launched on May 21, 2013, it was the first blockchain-based service to allow users “to publicly prove that you have certain information without revealing the data or yourself, with a decentralized certification based on the bitcoin network,” its website describes. According to Sunday’s announcement:\n\nIt [Proof of Existence] has processed thousands of documents supplying customers with immutable proof of existence for their assets.\n\nThe service offers document proofs that are stored on Bitcoin’s blockchain, without storing the document itself. The first of many similar services and protocols to do the task, Aráoz’s website uses a special bitcoin transaction that contains the hash in Bitcoin’s OP_RETURN script, embedding it into the bitcoin blockchain. It also lets users come back and verify their documents later.\nManuel Aráoz’s Other Projects\nAs part of the acquisition agreement, Canaan has retained Aráoz as an advisor on future product development and other blockchain related services. “Aráoz has agreed to continue on and advise the company on improvements to the product as well as other software services,” the company wrote. “The agreement ensures that there will be no interruptions in services and no changes in the API.” Commenting on the acquisition, Aráoz said:\n\nI’m really happy to close this deal with Canaan.[…] I’m looking forward to enhancing the product, and exploring other blockchain services.\n\nAráoz, who lives in Buenos Aires, has been involved in many projects surrounding and supporting the Bitcoin ecosystem. Proof of Existence was his first, which led to him working for Bitpay in 2014, where he helped develop the popular Javascript Bitcoin library, Bitcore.\nThat project led to the creation of Multipaper, the first multi-signature address paper wallet, which uses Bitcore. Then in May 2015, he created Streamium, a video livestreaming application like Periscope or Meerkat. Streamium was the very first application to use Nakamoto payment channels for micropayments while streaming live P2P video. Today Aráoz is working on Decentraland, a blockchain-based virtual reality project.\nWhat do you think of Canaan acquiring Proof of Existence? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "text": "\n Barry Silbert’s firm the Digital Currency Group (DCG) revealed a scaling agreement on May 23 with a letter of intent backed by 56 Bitcoin companies, for Sergio Demian Lerner’s recent Segwit-2Mb plan. The announcement states the signed agreement represents a “critical mass of the bitcoin ecosystem” with 83.28% of hash power supporting the proposal. \nAlso Read: Sidechain Juggernaut RSK Labs Launches Ginger Testnet After $3.5M in New Funding\nThe Anticipated ‘Barry Silbert Scaling Proposal’ Has Been Revealed\nFor a few days bitcoin enthusiasts have been anticipating the “Barry Silbert” scaling plan  hinted at a few days ago. Following Silbert’s statements about a new scaling effort, a meeting took place in connetion to the Consensus 2017 conference. As the conference came to an end, Silbert’s venture capital firm DCG revealed the compromise proposal. \nThe agreement is supported by 56 digital currency companies stemming from 21 countries worldwide. The letter states the agreement has the backing of over 83 percent of the network’s hash power. This group represents 5.1 billion USD monthly on chain transaction volume and 20.5 million bitcoin wallets within the economy.\n“We agree to immediately support the following parallel upgrades to the bitcoin protocol, which will be deployed simultaneously and based on the original Segwit-2Mb proposal,” explains the DCG announcement.  \n\nActivate Segregated Witness at an 80% threshold, signaling at bit 4 and activate a 2 MB hard fork within six months.\n\nA Proposal to Lower the Segwit Threshold to 80%\nPrior to DCG’s announcement discussions of lowering the Segwit threshold that took place during the Consensus 2017 scaling panel, Eric Lombrozo stated it was possible to lower the Segwit threshold. After the discussion on May 22, Bitcoin developer James Hilliard proposed a “Reduced signaling threshold activation” BIP.\n“I would like to propose an implementation that accomplishes the first part of the Barry Silbert proposal independently from the second: ‘Activate Segregated Witness at an 80% threshold, signaling at bit 4,’” explains Hilliard. “The goal here is to minimize chain split risk and network disruption while maximizing backward compatibility and still providing for rapid activation of Segwit at the 80% threshold using bit 4.”\n\n\nBy activating segwit immediately and separately from any HF we can scale quickly without risking a rushed combined segwit+HF that would almost certainly cause widespread issues.\n\n\nCompanies/Individuals that Approved Consensus; The Future of Bitcoin\nSome of the notable companies and people that agreed to this Segwit activation compromise include Decentral, Grayscale investments, Jaxx, Bitmain, Xapo, Yours, Bitpay, Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin.com and Guy Corem.\nThe medium article further suggested the community is prepared to handle any growing pains as a cohesive whole that has proven technical compromises can be made in the most challenging and high-risk environments. The consensus article echoed this sentiment:\n“We are also committed to the research and development of technical mechanisms to improve signaling in the bitcoin community, as well as to put in place communication tools, in order to more closely coordinate with ecosystem participants in the design, integration, and deployment of safe solutions that increase bitcoin capacity.”\nDo you think this concludes the mining debate?

Since this past April interest in the decentralized currency has grown quite a bit since the Japanese government legalized bitcoin as a form of payment. Now as the country continues to progress in adoption a possible blockchain split may happen in two weeks, and Japanese bitcoin businesses want to be prepared.\nAccording to the Nikkei Asian Review, the Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA) is currently deliberating guidelines for a one day to one week “freeze on bitcoin transactions.” The JCBA organization says it aims to “actively investigate and research necessary information, consolidate knowledge and exchange opinions, and aim for sound industry development” in Japan. As far as August 1 is concerned, the association made up of fourteen regional cryptocurrency exchanges says it wants to “protect customer assets.”\n\nJapanese Exchanges Detail Suspensions and Decision Announcements\nThe publication also details the trading platform Bitflyer is still undecided on its decision but will release an announcement next week. The Japanese exchanges Bitbank and Tech Bureau has detailed trading will be allowed, but deposits and withdrawals will be suspended until the possibility of a fork is resolved.\nThe statement from the JCBA and a few Japanese exchanges follows the announcement from the GDAX exchange on July 13. The exchange announced the suspension of deposits and withdrawals on August 1 and the possibility of halting trades as well. GDAX executive Adam White says the decision was based on technical risks and the possibility of “network instability.”\nMasayuki Tashiro, a data analyst at the Japanese trading platform Fisco, says the chance of instability could make some transaction records inaccurate.\n\nIf there really is a fork, some transaction records could disappear\n\nThere’s still a possibility that nothing happens on August 1 and the industry is just playing it safe as they did this past March. This weekend the code for Segwit2x will be delivered and Segwit activation could happen, which might stop the potential August 1 fork. The JCBA is just following protocol, and other exchanges will likely do so leading up to the next two weeks in order to protect their businesses from legal repercussions.\nWhat do you think about Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association drafting August 1 guidelines?

    "text": "\n Financial strategists, stock analysts, and tech gurus are all bullish on bitcoin. Even amidst concerns about how bitcoin will be upgraded and its recent violent price fluctuations, several public figures believe the cryptocurrency has a bright future. They tend to see bitcoin trending upward as demand for the digital currency accelerates. In this regard, bitcoin will either “cannibalize gold” or cause John McAfee to “eat his own dick on national television.” \nAlso read: The Bitcoin Scaling Countdown: Miners Begin Running Segwit2x Software\nTom Lee and the Cannibalization of Gold\nOn July 7, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee became the first big league Wall Street strategist to analyze bitcoin under a light of optimism. In a report, he claimed bitcoin could reach $55,000 by 2022. He also commented on the gold market, saying that urgency for possessing bitcoin will act as a substitute for gold. A CNBC article covered his enthusiasm:\n“We believe one of the drivers [of bitcoin] is crypto-currencies are cannibalizing demand for gold. Based on this premise, we take a stab at establishing valuation framework for bitcoin. Based on our model, we estimate that bitcoin’s value per unit could be $20,000 to $55,000 by 2022.”\nHe went on to say gold’s market value currently sits at $7.5 trillion, and bitcoin is $41 billion (at the time of writing). However, gold’s supply is swelling due to intensified mining operations, whereas bitcoin’s supply will remain stable as a result of the 21 million cap. This apparently places a huge demand burden on bitcoin, which may cause the price to trend forcefully upward.\nRonnie Moas and Bitcoin’s Limited Supply\nMajor stock research analyst Ronnie Moas also commented on Bitcoin’s supply cap. Earlier this month, he said, “Since only 21 million bitcoin can ever exist, increasing demand for the digital currency will naturally drive its price up.”\nMoas believes bitcoin can reach $5,000 just before the end of the year. He elaborated in comment to CNBC: “$5,000 could happen in a few months. It’s only starting to gain traction right now. It’s starting to spread like wildfire right now.”\nThe analyst said he personally put a few hundred dollars into bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies. He plans on investing even more. He mentioned bitcoin is not something he wants to miss out on. “What is more painful than losing money to cryptocurrency is inaction in the ecosystem, Moas said.\nJohn McAfee Vows to “Eat His Dick on National Television”; An Extremely Bullish Ride\nCybersecurity guru and libertarian presidential candidate John McAfee’s thinking follows alongside Moas, except McAfee tweeted to one of his followers today that if his predictions fail to materialize, he will dine on his own penis in front of everyone. McAfee made the comment after saying bitcoin will move above $500,000 within three years.\nHe said, “Bitcoin’s low of $1,800+ yesterday simply could not be maintained.

The photos were taken during her discussions before a House Financial Services Committee. The incident was not well received by government staff, with the man being hastily escorted from the building.\nPhotos of the bitcoin photo bomber and the public address for his bitcoin wallet soon began to circulate online, leading to the man receiving over $10,000 in donations in just a few hours.

There is also clothing merchandise celebrating the event available for purchase, and some twitter followers have asked to purchase his tie.\nBitcoin Sign Guy is not the first person to generate a sizable bitcoin bounty from holding a placard at a public event. In 2013, a fan attending a college football event waved a saying reading ‘hi mom, send bitcoin’ that also featured the QR to the individual’s wallet.

    "text": "\n There’s been a lot going on as far as development goes with the latest alternative clients and the Segwit2x plan also known as BTC1 on Github. One particular subject that came up on the BTC1 repository was the idea to incentivize the development community with time-locked bitcoins to smoothly activate a hard fork.\nAlso read: The Bitcoin Scaling Countdown: Miners Begin Running Segwit2x Software\nTime-locked Incentive for a Bitcoin Hard Fork\nChain engineer Oleg Andreev.\nThe hard fork has gotten a bad name over time mostly because of the contentious fork that took place with the Ethereum network. Hard forks aren’t forward-compatible, which means that the entire ecosystem of miners, wallet providers, exchanges, and merchants need to upgrade to the new code. The Segwit2x plan aims to activate Segregated Witness (Segwit) and follow up with a hard fork a few months down the line.\nThis week Oleg Andreev, product architect of the blockchain network company Chain introduced Issue #72 to the Github repo called “Time-locked incentive for Bitcoin hard fork.” The scheme Andreev says is to incentivize the community with coins that cannot be spent for a period of time until after the completion of a successful hardfork. The idea comes at a time when Segwit2x offers a compromise of both Segwit and a 2MB hard fork, but the problem is some people think the second part of the agreement won’t be fulfilled.    \n“It is well-known that cryptocurrency development can be incentivized by long-term time-locked coins,” explains Andreev. “Meaning, that the coins cannot be spent in the peak of a bubble, or right before a disaster that was not prevented or worked around. For instance, Greg Maxwell claims that Blockstream uses such scheme.”\nWhat Are Time-locked Bitcoins? \nTime-locked bitcoins cannot be spent until a specified time or block height by using a distributed contract recorded on the blockchain. Over the years there have been added improvements to this type of time-locking infrastructure with code development like Check-Lock-Time-Verify, Relative locktime, and Check-Sequence-Verify. Bitcoin luminary and author Andreas Antonopoulos discusses the subject of time-locked bitcoins in his book “Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain.” Moreover, in 2016 Thomas McCabe gave instructions on how he successfully spent a time-locked bitcoin transaction.\n“Bitcoin’s scripting language is very powerful, but access to resources with regards to learning how to build a script is scarce,” details McCabe.\n\n‘Measuring the Amount of “Skin in the Game” to Gauge Responsibility’\nChain engineer Andreev believes this technology could smooth the process of completing a successful hard fork. \n“Considering that any hard fork by definition carries an increased systemic risk: from producing chain splits inadvertently (due to overlooked software incompatibility), to splitting the market and shattering the faith in the technology and perspectives of our social experiment.”\n\nIt makes sense to introduce a special kind of time-locked incentives that get unlocked only on a hard-forked chain. Such incentives allow community to measure the amount of “skin in the game” to gauge the responsibility of the people behind a hard fork proposal.\n\nForward Compatibility \nAndreev gives specifications to his idea, and a few other developers including Jeff Garzik thought the concept was interesting. Additionally, Andreev’s proposal offers forward compatibility and “the code is expected to be modified to preserve the spirit of the proposal for the future hard forks,” explains the developer. Adding an incentive to smoothly activate a fork or fund bitcoin development, in general, is a unique concept but it’s likely this plan won’t be included in the Segwit2x working group’s current roadmap. There are multiple comments and suggestions made by developers that won’t make the final cut including funny ones like finding the Mt Gox missing bitcoins.\nWhat do you think about incentivizing hard forks with time locked bitcoins?

In the 12-page court order, the judge grants Doe 4’s “motions to intervene as of right and permissively.” These interventions are provided for by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 24. Fortune summarizes:\n\nThe judge agreed to let an anonymous customer, known only as “John Doe 4,” challenge the IRS’s power to enforce a sweeping summons it served on the San Francisco-based Coinbase last year for customer records.\n\nThe Case of John Doe 1, 2, 3 and 4\nThe case began on November 17, 2016 with the IRS’s petition to serve a “John Doe” administrative summons on Coinbase Inc, which was granted on November 30, 2016.\nThe following month, Coinbase customer Jeffrey K. Berns filed a motion to intervene and quash the summons, prompting the agency to withdraw its request for his information. In early January, Coinbase then moved to intervene and quash the summons, or for a protective order limiting its scope. In May, Coinbase customers, known anonymously as John Doe 1, 2 and 3, also filed motions to intervene and quash the summons.\nThis month, the IRS filed a notice that it “had narrowed the documents it seeks to obtain via the summons,” the court document describes.\nIn Tuesday’s court order, “The court grants the stipulation to substitute Doe 4 for Doe 1 and 2 and to permit John Doe 4 to proceed anonymously.” In addition, the IRS no longer seeks records belonging to Doe 1 and 2. While Doe 4’s Coinbase records are covered by the narrowed summons, Doe 3 has not offered any evidence that his records are covered by the narrowed subpoena so his motion to intervene is denied without prejudice.\nFrom the beginning, the agency’s investigation “has drawn fire from Coinbase and others who claim the agency’s demands ensnare too many people and involve too much information,” Fortune described, adding that:\n\nIn her ruling, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Corley strongly agreed, and declared the scope of the IRS request is unprecedented.\n\nWhat do you think of the court’s decision?

    "text": "\n A major mainstream investment company, Rothschild Investment Corporation, has embraced cryptocurrency by investing in bitcoin. The company recently filed a holdings report that solidified this investment move. They bought shares of the GBTC, or the bitcoin investment trust, which acts as a share that tacks its value to bitcoin’s price. \nAlso read: What Every Bitcoiner Should Know About ‘Bitcoin Cash’\nThe Econotimes covered the facts: “According to the details provided, Rothschild Investment Corporation has acquired shares of Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) for $210,000.”\nCourtesy of @cryptocentral on Steemit\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust\nThe Bitcoin investment trust is a U.S. based securities exchange. For clarity, some people have misinterpreted Rothschild Investment Corporation as directly buying and storing bitcoin. In reality, they merely purchased shares of the trust, which holds “bitcoin on paper” in the traditional fashion, as publicly quoted securities. This allows investors to keep and hold the value of bitcoin without having to purchase the currency and hold it in a wallet.\nThe Econotimes provided an explanation:\n\nSponsored by Grayscale Investments, the Bitcoin Investment Trust is an open-ended grantor trust based in the U.S. Its shares are publicly quoted securities solely invested in and deriving value from the price of bitcoin. The publicly traded shares officially started trading under the ticker GBTC in 2015.\n\nBitcoin shares began public trading via Bitcoin Investment trust on March of 2015. This move by Rothschild Investment Company represents a major mainstream player hedging bets on the future value of bitcoin.\nRothschild Investment Corporation and an Illuminati Conspiracy\nThere were also rumors that Rothschild Investment Corporation was related to the Rothschild family. In various social media posts, people thought there was some kind of conspiracy or deal that Rothchild himself made for gaining shares of bitcoin. The conspiracy theorists believe the Illuminati and lizard rulers may be colluding to sabotage bitcoin.\nThis turned out to be false, as the company has no relationship to the Rothschild family other than possessing its namesake. The tweets below should say “Rothschild Investment Corporation,” and not just Rothschild the person. The reason for confusion is clear, because the name is relatively common. Looks like the Illuminati are still waiting for their chance to enter the market.\n\nBREAKING: Rothschild Buy $BTC Bitcoin via $GBTC Bitcoin Investment Trust 539 SH https://t.co/2jm71uscCF /// https://t.co/gJ4z93rKld\n— Brian Cohen (@inthepixels) July 22, 2017 \nRothschild bought #bitcoin today via Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC).

They are leaving to embrace the titillating comeuppance of cryptocurrency. They see the digital token ecosystem as a sumptuous feast of unimaginable prosperity for themselves and the world.\nAlso read: Litecoin ATMs Proliferate Globally\nA recent article by Bloomberg reported that China Renaissance investor Richard Liu sacrificed a 7 figure salary to focus on bitcoin and cryptocurrency, especially initial coin offerings (ICOs).\n\nIn the Bloomberg piece, Liu says traditional banks and VC’s need to pay especially close attention to ICO’s. Liu has already backed about 20 ICO’s, including Tezos, which raised $200 million. Liu seemed especially proud of how there are few blockades in the industry and little impediments from regulators. He implied the future is bright, saying:\n\nUnlike the traditional financial sector, there are no ceilings or barriers. There’s so much to imagine.\n\nBankers Leaving Their Careers for Crypto-Related Opportunities is Nothing New\nBankers ditching their old Wall Street or banking careers, however, is not a new phenomenon. Most crypto enthusiasts are familiar with Blythe Masters of JP Morgan. She was seen as a “banking prodigy” and pioneered credit derivatives. In March 2015, she quit her job as an executive at JP Morgan to start Digital Assets Holding.\n\nAnother individual who worked for the banking industry, Justin Short, quit his career to begin bootstrapping his own crypto-related startup called Nous. Previously, Short created electronic trading algorithms for Bank of America. His project, Nous, is supposed to be a token-backed crypto asset portfolio manager.\nNikolay Storonsky — who helped found the London startup Revolut — was also deeply embedded in legacy finance. He was a former trader with Credit Suisse when he had a flashbulb moment. He realized that costs of foreign transactions were hopelessly archaic. This led him to help create Revolut, which will purportedly help the fintech industry move beyond banking. Storonsky has spoken candidly about his feelings toward banking.\n\nI just don’t like banks. They’re so bureaucratic, with so many managers not really doing anything … If you fired 80 percent of bankers, nothing would change.\n\nRegulatory Scrutiny Intensifies as Bankers Pivot\nEven though these former bankers appear ambitious to taste the sweet fruit of the crypto space, regulators are now preparing to pounce on the ecosystem. As bitcoin.com recently reported, SEC has declared some digital tokens might meet the definition of a security and be subject to Federal Security Laws. Kevin Helms, writing for bitcoin.com, reported:\n“The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced that Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales are subject to federal securities laws. The announcement follows a report based on an investigation into The DAO’s token sale in 2016, in which the Commission found DAO tokens to be securities.”\nNonetheless, it is optimistic to see bankers pivoting as the cryptocurrency ecosystem gets riled up by SEC’s ominous warnings. All these happenings foretells the coming of an interesting future for the cryptocurrency community.\n\nDo you foresee more bankers exiting legacy finance and joining the cryptocurrency space?

The company explained:\n\nWith this new funding option, American Express card members can now add funds to their Abra wallets immediately and send payments worldwide. This feature will be made available to a small group of Abra wallet users today and will be rolled out to our entire user base in the coming days.\n\nUsers need to already have an Amex card to use this option and they cannot sign up for one within Abra. In its announcement, the company provides information on how customers can sign up for an American Express card online.\nFees and Limits\nAbra recently updated its fee schedule. The company advertises “no transfer fees. Plus, sending money using your bank account, Abra wallet balance or your Bitcoin wallet is always free.”\nHowever, adding funds via an Amex credit card has a 4% fee. Adding or withdrawing funds via an Abra teller also has a fee starting at 1.5%, that goes directly to the teller. “When you add funds using cash at an Abra Teller, the Teller charges a small service fee. Tellers set their own fees, which are visible within the Abra app, so you always know how much you are going to pay,” the company clarifies.\nAbra has also updated its transaction limits. Amex credit card deposits have a daily limit of $200 and a $1,000 monthly limit. Bank deposits and withdrawals have a $500 daily limit, a $1,000 weekly limit and a $2,000 monthly limit. However, Abra warns that “bank regulations may supersede Abra’s limits: please check with your financial institution.” Meanwhile, bitcoin deposits and withdrawals have no limit.\nEligible cards are consumer cards issued by American Express or third-parties that are licensed to issue American Express-branded cards. American Express reloadable prepaid cards including Bluebird and American Express Serve cards are also eligible.\nAbra Tellers Standing by in 170+ Cities Globally\nLaunched in 2015 and available worldwide earlier this year, the Abra smartphone app is a bitcoin wallet that shows the balance in the currency of the user’s choice. In addition to bitcoin, the Abra app currently supports over fifty currencies, the company detailed, adding that “even if your local currency is not supported, you can still use the Abra app for exchanges in any supported currency.”\nOnly users themselves have access to their own private keys in Abra, even if the wallet’s balance is denominated in a fiat currency such as dollars or yen. Using smart contracts, Abra wallets can send or receive bitcoins to and from other Abra users and the network of human tellers for loading or cashing out in whichever currency the recipient requires.\nIn April, Abra announced that users in the U.S. and the Philippines could start buying bitcoin via over 60 banks and credit unions in the U.S. In May, the company announced that customers can use Abra Tellers to make cash deposits and withdrawals in over 170 cities and 50 countries worldwide, including over 1,500 Tellers in the Philippines.\n\nWhat do you think of Abra integrating with American Express?

Metastable was co-founded by Angellist CEO, Naval Ravikant, cryptography expert, Lucas Ryan, and former angel investor, Joshua Seims.\nFortune has reported that Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Union Square Venture, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Founders Fund are among Metastable’s major investors – all of whom participated in Polychain Capital’s fundraiser earlier this year.\nMetastable takes a long term perspective when assessing the markets, aiming to invest in projects that it expects will be profitable over the course of at least a decade. “There’s a handful of, say between five and 10 of these major use cases that could be trillion-dollar blockchains,” Seims told Fortune. “It’s all very long-term focused, and we think we’re in super early days right now. It really comes down to which do we think is the strong enough technology, that we think can win.”\nMetastable’s Flagship Cryptocurrency Hedge Fund Has Yielded Impressive Performance Throughout 2017\n\nMetastable’s website describes two funds offered by the firm, Metastable Balanced, and Metastable Edge. The ‘Balanced’ fund seeks to “take a value-investor approach to investing, guided by deep technical understanding of the protocols to select a portfolio that we believe will deliver the greatest returns”, holding a large portion of bitcoin, in additional to several smaller sized positions in major altcoins. ‘Edge’ is “designed for investors that already have substantial Bitcoin holdings”, and “holds ETH and a variety of smaller coins from more recent ICOs”, although “the ETH portion fluctuates based on whether we believe that the value from new coins is going to accrue to the new coin or to ETH”.\nMetastable’s flagship cryptocurrency hedge fund has yielded impressive performance throughout 2017. At present, Fortune asserts that Metastable’s ‘Balanced’ fund is invested in approximately a dozen different markets, including bitcoin, ethereum, and monero – of which it is reported to own roughly 1% of total supply. During mid-March, Metastable reported returns of 539%, however, since March, bitcoin, monero, and ethereum have more than doubled – prompting Fortune to estimate Metastable’s returns since inception are greater than 1,000%. On June 23 it is alleged that Metastable reported total assets of $69 million.\nMetastable requires a minimum investment of $1 million, and charges a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee.\nDo you think that cryptocurrency funds will continue to out perform mainstream hedge funds in coming years?

Now, investment firms and hedge funds have taken an even more keen interest in developing strategies and expanding their regulated portfolios to include more bitcoin options.\nThe primary company involved in the recent investment options, Miami International Holdings, Inc., is the parent company of Miami International Securities Exchange, LLC (MIAX Options) and MIAX PEARL, LLC.\nThe press release by LedgerX says that MIAX already offers trade options in 2,600 different classes. This implies bitcoin and other digital currencies will expand the company’s global monetary influence. This will put bitcoin into the U.S. securities and exchange limelight as the cryptocurrency tries to edge toward a price point of $3,000.\nDo you see the creation of this centralized venture exchange for bitcoin as a net positive?

    "text": "\n This week Judge Kenneth Marra came to a conclusion in the District of Florida class action lawsuit against Paul Vernon and his company Project Investors (Cryptsy). According to the final default judgment, Vernon is liable for the “principal sum of $8.2 million.”\nAlso read: Fork Watch: Take Extra Precaution When Trying to Access Post-Fork Tokens\nPaul Vernon Liable for $8.2M in Class Action Lawsuit\nThe curious case of the now defunct Cryptsy exchange has been a drawn out mystery for a very long time and is still not over. Back in January of 2016 the cryptocurrency trading platform Cryptsy said it was hacked for 13,000 BTC, and 300,000 LTC. Since then the founder of the exchange Paul Vernon, otherwise known as ‘Big Vern’, left his residency in Florida and allegedly is hiding out somewhere around Liaoning, China.\nPaul Vernon aka ‘Big Vern’ owner of the now defunct Cryptsy exchange. \nThe Cryptsy operator has also managed to do some interviews with Florida’s regional publication the Miami New Times. Vernon has denied any wrong doings and told the reporter he just regretted not being able to handle the hack the right way. Customers were not notified about the loss that happened in 2014 until the exchange was under water in 2016. Vernon and company operated the trading platform like a fractional reserve and hoped to pay the funds back but said bitcoin’s low price deterred that outcome. Since then Silver Law Group, Wites & Kapetan Law, two plaintiffs, and all others similarly situated started a class action lawsuit, No. 9:16-cv-80060, against Vernon and his exchange. There was also some involvement with the San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase.\nWhen visiting the old Cryptsy domain the page redirects to Cryptsysettlement.com.\nNow U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra has cast judgment down upon Vernon by favoring the plaintiff’s side. If Vernon is found and detained he will be liable for $8.2 million. \n“Plaintiffs’ motion for entry of final default judgment is granted,” explains the court order. \n\nDefendant Vernon is liable to the Plaintiff Class in the principal sum of $8,200,000.00, for which let execution issue forthwith.\n\nJudge Kenneth Marra adds, “prejudgment interest in the amount of $688,788.76 shall be awarded as interest on that principal sum from November 1, 2015, to the date of entry of this final judgment at the rate fixed by the Florida Department of Financial Services, as set forth by §55.03, Florida statutes.”\nJudge Kenneth Marra’s final default judgment. \nThe Mysterious Paul Vernon is Still Hiding Out\nFurther, the order also details that 11,325 BTC that were stolen from the trading platform and their tethered wallets, are the property of the plaintiffs.\n\nAs of the date of this final judgment, and stored in the following cryptocurrency wallets, are property of the plaintiff class and subject to and encompassed  within this final judgment \n\nVernon’s exact whereabouts are unknown, and if he is in China as is rumored, an extradition treaty will be difficult. Copies of the court order were sent to Vernon’s PO box in Delray Beach and his publicly known email.

    "text": "\n The bitcoin hard fork went off without a hitch, creating bitcoin’s new alter ego, bitcoin cash. Immediately following yesterday’s fork, individuals who protected their private keys gained access to bitcoin cash. However, those who stored their coins on an exchange, left that decision to the exchange. This caused tensions to flare between Coinbase and their customers. They are now angrily requesting their share of bitcoin cash from the company. \nAlso read: Panel Recommends Indian Government Take Immediate Steps to Stop Bitcoin Use\nPrior to yesterday’s chain split, several exchanges publicly stated they would not be providing support for bitcoin cash. Coinbase was one of these exchanges. They provided a FAQ answer page before the split got under way. In regards to bitcoin cash, they said:\n\nCoinbase will not support the BCC blockchain or digital currency. Any bitcoin within customers’ accounts will remain accessible on the main blockchain only. If you wish to have access to both BTC and BCC, please be sure to send your BTC off the platform by July 31.\n\nAfter the split occurred, everyone who had moved their funds off of Coinbase and maintained their private keys, got awarded with an amount of bitcoin cash equivalent to their bitcoin legacy holdings.\n\nCoinbase Customers Believe They are Entitled to Bitcoin Cash\nEven though Coinbase said they will not support bitcoin cash, their customers still believe they are entitled to it. They have been posting angry and accusatory messages on Coinbase forums.\nOne legal scholar, Tim Wu, pointed out that Coinbase could be in serious legal trouble if they do not hand over the bitcoin cash. He tweeted, “In my opinion, @coinbase is courting serious, maybe ruinous legal trouble if it doesn’t give its users the full value of the Bitcoin fork.” He also analogized the situation to a brokerage firm not giving stock splits to their customers.\nWu believes that even Coinbase’s terms of service agreement will not save them. He implies they are obligated to do the right thing and hand over the bitcoin cash.\n\nImagine a stock split where the broker declined to issue the new stock to its owners– that the @coincase position right now\n— Tim Wu (@superwuster) July 30, 2017 Coinbase Customers Legal Website Portal\nThere is even a website already set up for Coinbase customers to organize. It is the Coinbase Bitcoin Cash Lawsuit Portal. The site was apparently created to bring Coinbase customers together and initiate the start of legal proceedings. The site reads:\n\n“Our ultimate aim is work with Coinbase, Inc to help them understand the user community’s concerns and take the correct and appropriate action of allowing users to trade or withdraw the Bitcoin Cash tokens that rightfully belong to them following the 8/1/2017 Bitcoin hard fork. However, Coinbase needs to understand that the community is ready and willing to pursue legal action if their BCH tokens continue to be withheld by Coinbase Inc, resulting in tangible and significant financial loss.”\nNeedless to say, Coinbase will have ample pressure applied to them regarding the bitcoin cash debacle, which could escalate into a burdensome and pricey legal affair.\nEthereum Split; Coinbase Has Not Commented on the Situation\nStill, Coinbase may give into the pressure. This kind of situation has happened before. When Ethereum split last year into Ethereum Classic, Coinbase decided to give their customer base access to the currency. It took some time, though. A similar scenario could play out and Coinbase could finally hand over the bitcoin cash. At this time, however, it does not appear Coinbase has remarked on the situation.\nDo you think Coinbase with capitulate with demands for bitcoin cash from their customers?

    "text": "\n EU member nations are considering adopting measures that would allow states to protect against runs in failing banks by preventing people from accessing account deposits for up to 20 days. Reuters has revealed the proposal after receiving a leaked “EU document”.\nAlso Read: European Commission Launches Digital Currency and Dark Web Consortium\nThe Proposed Account Freezes Extend the Ability for States to Suspend Account Withdrawals\n\nIt has been revealed that EU states are considering implementing measures that would allow states to temporarily prevent citizens from making withdrawals from the accounts of failing banks. The proposals have been drafted since the start of 2017, and are designed to prevent bank runs and crises within the financial sector.\nThe proposed account freezes extend the ability for states to suspend account withdrawals – which currently exempt insured deposit accounts that hold less than 100,000 euros. The plan would allow the suspension of payouts for five working days, with a possible extension of 20 days allocated for “exceptional circumstances”. Existing EU legislation allows for states to initiate a two-day suspension of certain payouts in the event of potential bank failure – with deposits explicitly excluded.\nThe Proposals Have Received Criticism From Some European Financial Institutions \nThe European Union is no stranger to bank runs, with Spanish bank, Banco Popular, failing in recent months – the collapse of which was intensified by a sudden run on deposits. Another example is the 2013 Cyprus banking crisis, which saw much of the country’s population rush to convert their savings into alternative stores of value. This was in response to announcements that EU backed austerity measures allowing the seizure of citizens deposits to bail out failing banks had been passed. The events garnered great attention for bitcoin as a potential flight asset, with many attributing the April 2013 bitcoin bubble to Cypriot money suddenly flooding the bitcoin markets.\nThe proposals have received criticism from some European financial institutions, who have suggested that the proposed measures may exacerbate the risk of citizens withdrawing their funds in periods of financial uncertainty. Charlie Bannister of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe told media “We strongly believe that this would incentivize depositors to run from a bank at an early stage.”\nDo you think that the proposed legislation could intensify the risk of bank runs by making citizens more likely to withdraw deposits during periods of financial uncertainty?

He also said:\n\nBy the end of the year, around 150 Bitcoin ATMs will be installed throughout Ukraine. This is at the request of one customer who contacted us. Plus, there is a constant demand from entrepreneurs across Ukraine who want to engage in this business, that is, buy terminals and sell cryptocurrencies.\n\n\nCurrently, there is only one BTM in Ukraine shown on Coinatmradar, a website that tracks BTMs globally. This 2-way BTM was installed in late April and is located in Odessa, a port city on the Black Sea in southern Ukraine. It is the first BTM in the country, according to UBR.\nOther than this BTM, there are approximately 4,000 street terminals that reportedly sell bitcoin, the bitcoin service provider BTCU announced in 2014. They are not BTMs but customers can buy vouchers from them to redeem for bitcoin on the BTCU website.\nThe 150 Cryptomat BTMs to be installed later this year support the sale of bitcoin, ether, waves, and golos, according to its website. In addition, “unlike many competitors, Cryptomat does not require user identification.” Ukrainians will be able to purchase cryptocurrencies using the hryvnia, Chobanian detailed.\nHe also explained that anyone can get into the Bitcoin ATM business. “There is no need to obtain any licenses for this activity,” he detailed, citing the lack of cryptocurrency regulations in Ukraine. “No one gets licenses for coffee machine businesses.

    "text": "\n It’s been five days since the fork, and the Bitcoin Cash (BCH/BCC) blockchain is still on the move as 85 blocks have been processed by miners so far. The 85th block was mined by the mining pool Bitclub, a newcomer to the BCH network. The BCH chain is moving a bit more consistently now, but mining profitability and the gaming of the currency’s mining difficulty continues to be a struggle for the newly born network.\nAlso read: Segwit2x and the Tale of Three Bitcoins\nBitcoin Cash Mining Difficulty Needs to Drop More, but Something Might Be Stopping It\nAt the time of writing the BCH network hashrate is roughly around 300PH/s with blocks occurring roughly every 1-2 hours and some with longer intervals. Currently, there seems to be four pools working on the BCH chain and the largest of them is unknown. Another pool which has joined in on mining BCH blocks is a pool known as Suprnova.cc, and the group is known for publishing pretty interesting coinbase messages. Suprnova also mines many other digital currencies like Zcash and is only pointing very little hashrate towards the BCH network. At press time Suprnova has only 0.25 PH/s and eighteen workers dedicated to BCH.\nThe Suprnova pool on Twitter. \nThe first BCH block took approximately five hours to complete and was followed by a block with a 12-hour interval in between it as well. On August 1 the BCH chain started with the same difficulty as BTC’s and the associated token was only worth $600-700 at that time. That means – unless resources like electricity are completely free – mining the BCH chain at that time was not profitable. At BTC’s difficulty, BCH would have needed to be around $2100 to be profitable. \n\nThis is why there was an initial 12-hour wait to find the next block. Miners who support the new chain want the difficulty to drop. The difficulty did eventually fall several times, but the price also dived into the low $200s as well, making it 311% more profitable to mine on the BTC chain. The next difficulty drop should lock in soon and the Bitclub pool entry may indicate more miners are becoming attracted to this chain. \n24-hour BCH/USD charts according to Crypto Compare on August 5, 2017.\nGame Theory: The Malicious and Honest Miner\nSome people think a ‘malicious’ miner might be gaming the network, to hinder further difficulty adjustments. A few people on forums noticed this happening as one person writes, “There’s a pattern I’m seeing, someone with quite a lot of hash power is ramping up and producing two blocks minutes apart every time the adjustment nearly triggers.” Another individual observes the same situation taking place, \n\nI have been noticing the same pattern in real time. We almost reached twelve hours, Viabtc has no more than 25PH mining, last block took 339 minutes and BAM we get a thirteen minutes block. This is the third time it happens when we reach over 11.5 hours.\n\n‘Honest’ miners have been slowing down or ‘pausing’ for twelve hour periods so they can lower the difficulty even more. Presently the BCH chain’s difficulty is 26 percent of the BTC legacy chain’s mining difficulty. The Bitcoin Cash protocol’s rules detail that in order for the difficulty to adjust down it utilizes Median Time Past (MTP) of the last block and the MTP of the 6 previous blocks has to surpass twelve hours for it to drop another percentage.\nThe gray region, “other,” has mined 69% of the BCH blocks and was mined by an unknown mining source. The new entry Bitclub now captures 1.18% of the BCH network. \n The Unknown Miner Hashrate Commands Two-Thirds of the Entire Network\nThe malicious miner theory is entirely possible as these miners can use their hash power to produce a block between the paused intervals. This has caused people to speculate specifically on the unknown miner that has mined a majority of the blocks so far. It doesn’t seem to be the Hong Kong miner who was advertising his new cryptocurrency center at the start of the BCH chain.\nFurther, we know the Suprnova pool’s coinbase data said ‘fuckbitcoincash’ and the pool could also be ‘attack mining’, but it has very little strength compared to the unknown mining majority. If anything is disrupting these longer block intervals that are intended to drop the difficulty, it’s most likely this anonymous miner. \nWhat do you think about the Bitcoin Cash chain getting attacked by malicious miners? Do you think this theory is plausible? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

    "text": "\n As bitcoin’s price skyrocketed on Thursday May 25, one analyst predicted an imminent correction. The price of bitcoin soon fell sharply before reaching $2,800 as she predicted. She also gave some price forecasts, warning of a downturn for the rest of the year but record highs in 2018.\nAlso read: Fidelity Integrates with Coinbase, Mines Bitcoin and Accepts Bitcoin at its Cafeteria\nFibonacci Retracement\nAn analyst at Forex Analytix, Nicola Duke, uses a method called Fibonacci retracement to analyze the price of bitcoin as well as determine its support and resistance levels.\nThis popular technical analysis tool is based on the idea that markets will retrace a predictable portion of a move before continuing in the original direction. It looks at the peaks and troughs or rallies and falls of historical bitcoin prices in order to forecast future movements.\n“According to Fibonacci analysis, the way bull markets typically work is that you’ll have a pullback that stops when it retraces a key percentage of a previous move higher,” CNBC explains, adding that these key percentages come from Fibonacci Ratios. Examples of key ratios which technical traders like to use are .618, .786, 1.27, 1.618, and 2.618.\nBitcoin’s Price Analysis\nDuke’s Fibonacci retracement analysis chart, using Bitstamp weekly prices going back to 2013, was published on Tradingview.com on Thursday.\nBTCUSD support levels weekly chart (Photo\\Nicola Duke)\nShe indicated on the chart that $2,283 is the short-term trend support; another support level above that is $2,800. In addition, bitcoin has two major support levels below $2,283. They are $2,145 and the more likely $1750-80. Both are shown on her chart.\nIn an interview with  CNBC on Thursday morning, Duke explained that “wave two” of bitcoin began in the fall of 2013. The price of bitcoin rallied sharply for several months before falling steadily. It bottomed out in January 2015, then began to climb again. Currently, bitcoin is in “wave three”, the publication relayed her findings:\n\n$2,800 could be the level at which bitcoin begins its fall. The price is likely to hit $1,780, but could even fall as far as $1,470.\n\nDuke expects this next wave, which is the fourth, to last 61.8 percent of how long wave two lasted. 61.8 percent is one of the key Fibonacci ratios.\nShe believes that the rally after the correction would start in January. “We will see the bottom at the start of January, that is when stock markets typically tend to have a correction as well,” she noted, then explained to CNBC that:\n\nAfter that, there should be a sustained rally to $3,350 and then $4,480 in 2018.\n\nWhat do you think of this Fibonacci retracement analysis?

    "text": "\n Just recently Bitcoin.com reported on the two-year anniversary of Ross Ulbricht’s double life sentence for his involvement with the Silk Road marketplace. On May 31 a three-judge appellate panel denied Ulbricht’s sentence appeal while at the same time criticizing U.S. drug policies.\nAlso read: India’s Government Divided Over Bitcoin Legalization\nOfficials May Someday Regard Drug Policies as ‘Tragic Mistakes’ \nRoss Ulbricht.\nWednesday, May 31st was another challenging day for the Ulbricht family as a U.S. federal appeals panel decided to keep Ross Ulbricht’s double life term sentence in place. Ulbricht was convicted on May 29, 2015, for his role in the Silk Road marketplace which hosted illicit narcotic sales. Since then Ulbricht and his family members have been fighting the ruling in handed down by U.S. District Judge Katherine B. Forrest for months on end in the federal appeals court system.\nThree judges from the US Court of Appeals Second Circuit revealed their decision in a 130-page document released to the public. Although the court denied the appeal, the judges did criticize the harsh punishments U.S. laws inflict on citizens for drug prosecutions.\n“Reasonable people may and do disagree about the social utility of harsh sentences for the distribution of controlled substances, or even of criminal prohibition of their sale and use at all,” explains the three judge’s position.\n\nIt is very possible that, at some future point, we will come to regard these policies as tragic mistakes and adopt less punitive and more effective methods of reducing the incidence and costs of drug use.\n\nCourt Says Elected U.S. Representatives Uphold Prohibition and Harsh Sentences\nNevertheless, the court states that representatives chosen by U.S. residents continue to bolster prohibition and harsh sentences. “The district court gave Ulbricht’s sentence the thorough consideration that it required, reviewing the voluminous sentencing submissions, analyzing the factors required by law, and carefully weighing Ulbricht’s mitigating arguments,” explains the court documents.\nUlbricht Family Will Not Stop Fighting\nRoss’s mother Lyn Ulbricht and his family have stated they are shocked by the decision but will “not stop fighting.”\n“I’m in shock,” explains Ulbricht’s mother. “I feel like I’m reliving the day Ross was sentenced and now must tell Ross that the Second Circuit has upheld his convictions and double life sentence — I can’t fathom how the court can believe that keeping Ross locked up for the rest of his life accomplishes anything but wasting a life and lots of money. Do they really think that if Ross emerges in twenty years, after not having been on the internet all that time, he would be a threat to society in any way?”\n\nThe Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 says a ‘judge should impose a sentence that is“sufficient, but not greater than necessary.’ How is a double life sentence plus 40 years by any stretch necessary? Even if everything Ross has been accused of is true, which we steadfastly do not believe, a life sentence is draconian and unnecessary — We will not stop fighting.\n\nFor now, Ulbricht’s sentence will continue, and there has been no announcement from defense attorneys yet on how they will continue the legal fight. It’s interesting that throughout the large court document the three-judge panel showed contention with the punitive measures set forth by U.S. legislators, but failed to challenge the laws in this particular case.\nWhat do you think about the judge’s decision to keep Ulbricht in jail but criticized drug laws at the same time?

    "text": "\n This week Bitcoin.com chatted with Thomas Hunt otherwise known as ‘Mad Bitcoins’ about a new blockchain based collectibles project he started — Curio Cards. The collectibles are a digital trading card that can be exchanged or stored on the Ethereum blockchain.\nAlso read: Mining Pool Viabtc Launches New Cryptocurrency Trading Platform\nCollectible trading cards is a billion dollar industry as people trade decks of their favorite sports players, Pokemon characters, Magic the Gathering spells, and many other types of interesting subjects around the world. Virtual trading cards tethered to blockchain technology has recently become a new trend as Spells of Genesis, and Rare Pepe have become popular collectibles within the crypto-community.\nMr. Hunt believes blockchain-based collectibles will be a big success in the future and has teamed up with some artists to help further his project. He’s also a fan of some of the other crypto-collectibles on the market and gives Bitcoin.com readers some insight into the different attributes Curio Cards offer.\nCurio Cards: Blockchain-Based Digital Collectibles   \nBitcoin.com (BC): What are Curio Cards? \nThomas Hunt (TH): Curio Cards are digital trading cards on the Ethereum blockchain.  \nBC: What gave you the idea to create the Curio Card concept?\nTH: I’ve always been a collector. I collected baseball cards, books, movies and now of course cryptocurrency. People love to collect things, so I thought, why not combine my love for cryptocurrency with my love for collecting and make something fun.   \nBC: How many card sets have been released so far?\nTH: In the past three weeks we’ve released four sets, a total of ten cards. Tuesday is new card day, so we always print new cards on Tuesday. These early cards were more of a test phase. In one week we will start releasing Artist Cards. \n\nThese cards will not only be created by artists, but the artists will also receive all of the proceeds. The artists can also use the cards as future rewards for their community or simply burn them, reducing their number and increasing their value.  \n\nBC: How are the cards stored on the Ethereum blockchain? \nTH: First we store the image of the Curio Card in IPFS, allowing the images to be hosted on their network. Then we store a link to the image in an ERC20 token on Ethereum. The tokens that represent Curio Cards are unlike any collectible in history, in that at the time of their creation they are limited in number, provably rare and their entire chain of custody can be verified.  \nThe first set of Curio Cards.\nBC: Since you started how has the community response towards your collectibles been?\nCurio Cards founder and CEO, Thomas Hunt aka ‘Mad Bitcoins.’\nTH: We’ve had an incredibly positive reaction to Curio Cards. What I’m impressed by is that people are already starting to collect sets. Since the cards are on a blockchain, anyone can see the transactions, and if you look, people are buying in groups. They also seem to have favorite cards that they buy more of than others, and I think this will play out more with ‘Artist Cards’ when you might want more copies of your favorite works to send them out to friends or perhaps a certain piece resonates with you and you just have to buy as many as you can.   \nBC: What’s your opinion of the Rare Pepe blockchain-based trading cards?\nTH: I’m very impressed with the way they created value and developed their community. I believe it’s because of projects like Spells of Genesis and Rare Pepe that we’ve had such a positive reaction to Curio Cards. \n\nThere’s a lot of collectors out there on the internet, and we all have the same goal: ‘gotta collect ‘em all.’\n\nBC: Can you tell our readers about some of the artists involved with the project and how an artist can submit some artwork? \nTH: We’re keeping the artists secret right now (new cards every tuesday!), but we are reaching out to several well-known artists in the cryptocurrency art community, and we’re constantly on the lookout for new artists. Artists can sign-up here. This is a great opportunity for artists to not only spread the word about their work, but also to get paid in cryptocurrency. It’s a win-win.   \nBC: Do you believe blockchain-based collectibles will be big in the future?\nTH: What excites me about blockchain-based collectibles is that you actually own the token. Much like Bitcoin, you can store them in a paper wallet, a hardware wallet, an online wallet, etc. With a centralized online collectible, it’s just not the same experience of ownership. I think that when people try out blockchain collectibles like Curio Cards, they’ll notice that difference and realize the value in owning cryptographic collectibles. I believe blockchain-based collectibles will be very big in the future.

What’s interesting about the job initiative is the $416,000 of stimulus funding that will go to a bitcoin mining data center in Missoula County, called “Project Spokane.”\nAlso read: Bitcoin: Hardware or Software? That is the Question\nBitcoin Mining Company From Montana Gets Job Stimulus Funding \nOfficials in Montana and the state’s Governor, Steve Bullock, plan to bolster local businesses with job stimulus funding. According to the governor $1.1 million will be distributed to innovative companies that reside in particular counties across the state. One of them is Project Spokane LLC, a company that says it provides blockchain security validation services for the Bitcoin network; otherwise known as mining. Project Spokane applied for a $600,000 grant but will receive $416,000 from the Big Sky Economic Development Trust Fund (BSTF).  \n“Project Spokane, LLC is a data center that provides blockchain security services for the bitcoin network,” explains Montana’s government website announcement.\n‘On Their Way to Becoming North America’s Largest Data Center’\nAccording to commentary from James Grunke, the president and CEO of the Missoula Economic Partnership, in an interview with the local publication the Missoulian it is great news for the county.    \n “They are on their way to becoming North America’s largest data center,” Grunke tells the Missoulian about Project Spokane last March. \n\nThey are going to have 55,000 servers, and right now they only have 12,000. It’s pretty exciting.\n\nProject Spokane also says that it will create 65 new jobs for residents and the data center will be located at the old Bonner mill site. Funds will be used to purchase more equipment, and software for the company’s Bitcoin network services. Project Spokane has a few job listings posted on sites like Linkedin and Community Spiceworks, looking for service providers.\nFirst Government Funded Bitcoin Operation Will Join the Growing Landscape of U.S. Mining Facilities  \nThe Montana data center will join the steadily growing bitcoin mining operations taking place in the U.S. The well-known U.S. bitcoin miner Dave Carlson is in the process of building up his latest mining operation Giga Watt in the states. Meanwhile, the anti-virus tycoon John McAfee has also created a bitcoin mining facility in the U.S. and has partnered with Bitmain. Moreover, the bitcoin infrastructure firm Bitfury also has an operation in the state of Georgia which also aims to bolster the state’s economy and jobs.    \nThe job stimulus funding provided to Montana businesses is also one of the first grants given to a bitcoin mining operation based in the U.S. Governor Bullock believes the companies chosen for funding will help build a stronger economy in Montana. Furthermore, the site at Bonner Mill has been growing and attracting new businesses according to Michael Boehme, the owner of Bonner Property, which is 170 acres of land.\nWhat do you think about the state of Montana helping fund a bitcoin mine?

According to reports blockchain developers and qualified cryptocurrency engineers see the demand for their talents and are asking for salaries of between £200,000 and £300,000.\nAlso read: India’s Government Divided Over Bitcoin Legalization\n‘A Ph.D. in Blockchain Could Make You a Fortune’\nWell-known finance firms and many other types of companies are steadily searching for blockchain programmers. The demand for these careers can be seen in great numbers across many job listing websites. For instance, Monster.com, Indeed.com, and others show a wide variety of listings looking for blockchain developers. Some of the firms looking for these types of developers include well-known companies such as AT&T, Fannie Mae, Accenture, and Liberty Mutual. Richard Burgess-Kelly, founder of reg-tech company Liberam, says, “there’s a talent shortage in the network,” in regards to blockchain talent.         \n\nThere’s a big shortage in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain. When you have done a Ph.D. in blockchain, you can make a fortune.\n\nDemand for Blockchain Experts Grows Worldwide \nThe phenomenon is taking place all around the world as many European and Asian businesses are also looking for distributed ledger engineers. Companies such as Fujitsu, Toyota, Intel, Santander, UBS, and Barclays are showing a strong interest in blockchain talent as well. \nThe former chief information officer at UBS and founder of Bussmann Advisory, Oliver Bussmann, explains that typical blockchain developers are easily getting “£200,000 and £300,000” for an annual salary. Additionally, Bussmann details that he believes there are only 20,000 people worldwide with this kind of talent. “That’s not a lot. Demand for these skills is high. To get the talent you have to pay,” Bussmann tells the publication Financial News.\nProgramming Knowledge Could Get You the Job but ‘Banking Language’ Is a Plus\nMany of these job openings are very technically advanced and require a solid understanding of code and programming. Businesses are looking for backend and front end developers, those who understand codebases like Java, C++, Ethereum’s Solidity, Python and many more.\nFor instance, Bank of America (BoA) is looking for a blockchain expert who also understands cloud infrastructure and machine learning. BoA wants someone with blockchain technical expertise that can work hands on with proof of concept platforms. Additionally, a background in finance is helpful for this job as BoA wants some experience with FICC, equities, payments processing, and wholesale credit as well.\nAccording to Tim Coates, a managing consultant for the blockchain technology consultancy firm Synechron speaking the banking language is a big plus for those looking for a lucrative career. “If you speak banking language and you have blockchain experience you are in a very good position,” explains Coates.\nAs bitcoin and other cryptocurrency economies continue to rise the demand for this type of talent will likely grow significantly larger in the future.\nWhat do you think about the current demand for blockchain specialists?

Since the beginning of 2017 the price of a single bitcoin has tripled, creating an all-time high of over $2900USD on Bitstamp.\nOver the last 7 years Bitcoin’s price has grown by an average of 0.3% daily, culminating in Bitcoin’s current market cap of over $45bnUSD, renders the digital currency of comparable size to Tesla – who currently boast a $50bnUSD market cap.

New investors should exercise caution in interpreting these facts as evidence of Bitcoin’s inevitable unending price ascension, as the price of a single bitcoin has gone up over 1000% since 2015.\n\nEntering the 12-digit club ranks the cryptocurrency ecosystem alongside major banks such as Commonwealth Bank of Australia ($105bnUSD market cap), Royal Bank of Canada ($100bnUSD market cap), and puts the cryptocurrency ecosystem of comparable size to McDonalds US – who currently have a total market cap of approximately $125bnUSD.

The extreme percentage gains seen by many altcoins are very likely to be unsustainable long-term, suggesting that a contraction in the share of the total cryptocurrency market cap represented by altcoins may be inevitable. If so, the only question is: when?\nDespite the intensity of the current cryptocurrency bubble, a recent resurgence in Chinese trading volume following a return to normal operations regarding fiat deposits and withdrawals may drive further growth in the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies in the immediate future.\nWill altcoins be able to retain over a 50% share in total cryptocurrency market capitalization?

It manages state-owned properties, collects overdue taxes, as well as purchases and resolves non-performing loans of financial institutions.\nSince seizing bitcoins, the organization has been contemplating what to do with the digital currency since there was no precedence.

It was the first time a domestic investigative agency seized digital currency as a criminal profit.\nSubsequently, the price of bitcoin has more than doubled since the seizure. Its value rose from 260 million won to 673 million won (approximately $596,500 USD) at press time on popular Korean bitcoin exchange Korbit.\nRecognizing Economic Value of Bitcoin\nAccording to South Korean Criminal Procedure Law, when a court confiscates an asset from an investigative agency, it becomes the property of the state, The Seoul Economic Daily explains. If forfeited, the asset will be valued and auctioned off to the treasury. An official of the prosecution conveyed (loosely translated):\n\nSince the state has ownership rights to the asset, if it is forfeited, the state agency, such as the prosecution or the police, will be able to publicize the object for sale on the website of the Asset Management Corporation with ownership rights.\n\nThe commission on this bitcoin auction is estimated to be about 20 million won or 3% of the proceeds. It will be deducted from the balance and the remainder transferred to the treasury.\n“Real estate and securities other than legal currency are regulated by the presidential decree so that they can be sold by the presidential decree,” KAMCO explained. “Virtual currencies are not included in the public auction exemption, so it is possible to dispose of it.”\nThe representative of the prosecution noted, “once the prosecution goes to a bitcoin auction, the social controversy over whether or not virtual currency should be recognized is actually over,” The Seoul Economic Daily reported. MSN Korea added (loosely translated):\n\nAs the public auction process proceeds, domestic investigators and public institutions will be the first to officially recognize the economic value of virtual money.\n\nWhat do you think about the Korean government auctioning bitcoins and in doing so recognizing its economic value?

    "text": "\n The left opposition leader of Australia, Bill Shorten, has indicated he wants to deter use of cryptocurrencies and bitcoin. The leader said this Tuesday in a house of representatives meeting. Shorten suggested that terrorists are starting to leverage dark markets and other nefarious venues to fuel their bad deeds. \nAlso read: The Hidden Reason Behind Bitcoin’s Increasing Fees: Darknet Mixers\nHe said, “I refer to the use of the digital currency bitcoin and the use of the dark web, a network of untraceable online activities and hidden websites, allowing those who wish to stay in the shadows to remain hidden. Terrorists are increasingly using this network to avoid detection, conduct planning and acquire capability and tools to carry out their evil actions”\nShorten loosely admitted that government does not yet know enough about cryptocurrency or the dark web to handle them. In his statement he referenced them, saying, “There are two things we simply do not know enough about to deal with properly.” This also implies the Australian government could approach the issue in a variety of ways, but that cryptocurrency is a growing concern as a result of possible “terrorism.”\nHe finished by claiming certain actions are necessary for the safety and security of the Australian citizens. He said:\nJust as we continue to do everything in our power to protect Australians, we must do everything in our power to foster cohesion in our society. This is a responsibility we bear as national leaders and also an obligation shared by the leaders of Australia’s Muslim community.\nCryptocurrency Inspires Fear and Love\nThe Australian leader wants everyone in their country to share their fear of dark markets and cryptocurrencies since terrorists could possibly exploit them. However, the current times are strange. Some countries and their government, like Australia, harbor a deep skepticism toward cryptocurrencies and bitcoin. But others seem to take a more positive approach. They may even love digital currencies.\nFor instance, places like Japan and, more recently, Russia…appear to harbor more positive and loving feelings toward the currencies. Japan has already accepted digital currencies on the whole, and Russia is considering it as vitally important for the future.\nOn the other side of the coin, some countries like Ecuador, have already banned cryptocurrencies and punish people for using them. It seems that Australia’s leadership has similar sentiments like in Ecuador, except not quite as extreme.\nIt is increasingly interesting to watch varying perspectives crop up within different countries around the world as bitcoin and other crypto-assets become more popular.\nDo you think Australia will take measures to ban cryptocurrencies or use other strong regulation against it? Let us know in the comments below.  Images via Shutterstock Bitcoin is cool, and you know everyone wants in – even the ones who say they don’t.

    "text": "\n Investment bank Morgan Stanley stated in a report they have been receiving many calls from people interested in investment opportunities with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, the bank implied bitcoin and its ecosystem would need to submit itself to regulation prior to seeing any future growth. They want regulators involved so the blockchain can be `adequately´ controlled. “Regulators are looking to have a master key so all transactions are visible to them,” the bank noted.\nAlso read: Popular Demand Spurs Goldman Sachs to Start Covering Bitcoin\n\nThe investment bank also mentioned they have no idea why bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are growing so quickly. They believe rampant speculation on crypto markets have driven the price upwards for no clear reason. They said: “It is not clear why cryptocurrencies are appreciating so rapidly (apart from the appreciation itself drawing in more speculation against a potentially inefficient ability to sell).”\nA Market Watch article, which quoted Morgan Stanley, further stated the blockchain is a “centralized” ledger that records all transactions and that the investment bank did not specify what regulations would be necessary. They simply announced that regulations and controls should be put into place.\nMorgan Stanley’s Interest in Permissioned Blockchains\nPart of these regulations could involve Morgan Stanley’s acceptance of “permissioned blockchains,” which they wrote about last May in a blog titled “banking on the blockchain.” They would create controlled blockchains only authorized individuals could access. This would allow them to maintain the prominence of their banking industry and adopt streamlined regulations while leveraging blockchain technology.\nIn the post, they referenced another article, saying:\nPermissioned blockchains—a digitally distributed ledger where authorized users can record, process and verify transactions—to streamline their own operations and costs…\nSatoshi Nakamoto’s Original Vision\nThis may indeed streamline their costs, but it would likely also sacrifice Satoshi Nakamoto’s original intention of blockchain technology, which was to put banking inside the hands of the individual.\nIn the White Paper, Satoshi said, “Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.”\nThis is what Satoshi’s envisioned, but it remains to be seen whether Morgan Stanley’s idea of the master key in blockchain technology will trump the idea of bypassing third parties. Many in the ecosystem still hope Satoshi’s original vision will prevail in the end.\nDo you think the banks will be able to effectively regulate bitcoin and create permissioned blockchains?

    "text": "\n In the face of rising Bitcoin network transaction fees, the premier over-the-counter exchange Localbitcoins is enacting several changes to their fee structure. The company aims to cover the higher fees by spreading the cost fairly among customers.\nAlso read: Popular Demand Spurs Goldman Sachs to Start Covering Bitcoin \nNew Fee Structure\nLocalbitcoins has introduced a new fee structure which will affect all customers. Citing the rising Bitcoin network fees, the company announced on Tuesday the details of their new fees:\nIn order divide the costs of handling Bitcoin transactions in a fair manner we are introducing deposit fees for incoming transactions. At the same time we will lower Bitcoin sending fees for all customers. The new fee system will be put into effect around 19th-21st June.\nThe Finland-based company with bitcoin sellers and buyers in almost every country further explained that “you can save further on the sending fee by timing your transaction to when the network is quiet.”\nHowever, the new “deposit fees will be larger than the new sending fees,” they disclosed, adding that “generally we expect it to be about 3x the amount of sending fees per transaction.”\nImproving Existing System\nThe existing fee structure at Localbitcoins has the drawback of overcharging fees to users withdrawing bitcoins, but none to those depositing them.\nSellers will now be covering two Bitcoin network fees; one for the cost of sending the coins into escrow and the second from escrow to the buyer. With the new fee system, “we want to spread these costs more fairly between our customers” the company wrote.\nOver the years, Localbitcoins found that a large part of each Bitcoin transaction fee was used to cover the costs related to deposits, not withdrawals. The company clarified:\nThis means that customers who make many small deposits to their Localbitcoins wallet causes the sending transaction fees to rise, and these costs were paid by customers who were sending bitcoins.\nThe new deposit fee will ensure that the customers who make lots of small network transactions that cause larger network fees “will pay a larger share of the overall transaction costs.” Meanwhile, the customers who merely withdraw their coins “will enjoy lower fees.”\nAlso announced on Tuesday was an automatic fee adjustment feature on every transaction “based on how congested the Bitcoin network is.” Traffic on the Bitcoin network will be constantly monitored and fees adjusted to ensure the overall fees paid are smaller, Localbitcoins claims.\nWhat do you think about Localbitcoins’ new fee structure?

The United Kingdom saw growth of 11.5% (+7 ATMs), and Japan saw growth of 36.4% (+4 bitcoin ATMs).\nBitlish closed its three ATMs located in St. Petersburg, which were the sole bitcoin ATMs in Russia reported to the site Coinatmradar. Bitlish’s exit from the Russian market comes amidst claims that it plans to install 5,000 new bitcoin ATMs across Europe – although the company’s hasty exodus has left some analysts skeptical regarding how long the ATMs are likely to remain open.\nNorth America Currently Host 75% Percent of All Bitcoin ATMs Globally\nAs indicated by Coinatmradar, The United States currently holds a significant lead over countries for the number of active ATMs, with 851 currently in operation. Canada is second with 167 ATM locations, followed by the United Kingdom (68 ATMs), Spain (34 ATMs), Austria (25 ATMs), and Finland (21 ATMs).\n\nNorth America currently host 75% percent of all bitcoin ATMs as reported by Coinatmradar. European ATMs accounts for 20% per cent of the total.\nCoinatmradar’s data almost entirely pertains to major companies issuing bitcoin ATMs, and thus is likely an inacurate representation of the number of bitcoin ATMs that are independently or privately installed.\nAlthough the number of ATMs issued by major companies in a region is a narrow indicator by which to judge the development of its cryptocurrency economy, this data suggests that much of the developing world still has a long way to go in developing its cryptocurrency economy and infrastructure.\nDo you think that more bitcoin atms is a good thing for the cryptocurrency economy?

Miller described bitcoin as a major technological disruptor, and a catalyst for fierce change within the domain of finance. “It is a true disruptor and true innovation in money,” Miller said.\nThe investment legend has assessed bitcoin’s potential with a long-term perspective in mind. With regard to the scale of fiscal innovation and creative destruction that bitcoin may unleash upon traditional financial and monetary processes and technology, Miller described cryptocurrency as being a catalyst for economic disruption on a scale that “we haven’t seen… in thousands of years.”\n“If [Bitcoin] Becomes Only 10 Percent as Popular as Gold, Then It’s an $800 Billion Market Value.”\nThe 10-year chief investment officer of Legg Mason Capital Management has been outspoken in his belief in bitcoin since investing heavily following the collapse Mt. Gox in 2014. In a 2014 interview with CNBC, Miller blasted negative comments regarding bitcoin that had been made by Warren Buffet, describing Buffet as possessing a “logical flaw in his thinking, and emphasizing the growth potential of bitcoin should expansion in the cryptocurrencies userbase continue.” “If [bitcoin] becomes only 10 percent as popular as gold, then it’s an $800 billion market value. You can lose 100 percent of your money, or you can make 120 times your money. I think the risk reward is OK.”\n\nThe fixed supply of bitcoin has always been of appeal to Miller, prompting the investor to make numerous comparisons between bitcoin and gold. Miller has previously emphasized the historic fluctuations in gold’s price when discussing the volatility of bitcoin, suggesting that Miller is in no way deterred by bitcoin’s price movements, and see bitcoin as a legitimate contender for mainstream status in the not too distant future.\nMiller joins a long list of mainstream investors whose involvement with bitcoin has garnered the attention of mainstream financial press following the recent meteoric rise of bitcoin across 2017. Although all eyes are on bitcoin’s astounding gains right now, many investors like Miller were largely dismissed by the mainstream press when singing bitcoin’s praises during the post-China bubble downtrend.\nDo you think that bitcoin can reach 10% of gold’s total market capitalization?

The company started its services back in 2011 and aims to continue making digital currencies easier to use for everyday people.\nAlso Read: State of Montana Funds Bitcoin Mine to Bolster Local Jobs\nBlockchain Raises $40 Million in Funding for Global Expansion and Digital Asset R&D\nThe online wallet Blockchain.info is one of the oldest bitcoin-based businesses within the industry. The company’s blockchain explorer and data analytics gets millions of visitors, and the platform has issued close to 15 million wallets. Now Blockchain has announced it has raised $40 million in a Series B funding round led by the firms Lakestar and GV (formerly Google Ventures). Other investors that participated in the round include Nokota Management, Digital Currency Group, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Mosaic Ventures, Prudence Holdings, Virgin, and Sir Richard Branson.\n“Blockchain was one of the first digital currency wallets, quickly grew to market leadership, and has only extended its lead since then,” said investor and current board member, Jeremy Liew from Lightspeed Venture Partners. “Now that bitcoin and Blockchain have started to get broader traction, they are the best positioned to become the mainstream leaders.”\n‘A Financial System That is Faster, More Inclusive, and Radically Different’\nThis week Bitcoin.com chatted with Blockchain’s CEO and Co-Founder, Peter Smith who told us the new capital will be used for global expansion and improving localization efforts, as well as research and development of emerging digital assets. Furthermore, Smith gives our readers some insight into how his company initially started, its primary focus, and how the co-founder sees the cryptocurrency ecosystem today.        \n\nThe 14 trillion dollar financial services industry hasn’t meaningfully changed in over a century. Blockchain is on a mission to create a financial system that is faster, more inclusive, and radically different than the status quo.\n\nBitcoin.com (BC): Can you give our readers a summary of how the Blockchain company was conceived?\nPeter Smith (PS): So Blockchain was originally a pretty simple idea. It was just the idea that you could make bitcoin easier to use for everyday people. From the very beginning, bitcoin was hard to use even if you were a developer. Controls were really bad, and the wallet software was hard to use, and we got a start on building software that made bitcoin easier and more approachable.\n\nThat’s more or less what we’ve been doing for the entire company history now — Every year and every month making digital currencies easier to use for everyday people.\n\nBC: How would you compare the early days of your company compared to now with Bitcoin interest and price at all time highs?\nBlockchain’s CEO and Co-Founder, Peter Smith.\nPS: I think the big difference is in the early days there weren’t that many users, and now there are millions of users. In the beginning, there were only a few of us working at Blockchain, and now there are about 50 people that work for the company. So there’s a lot more users and a lot more people working for the company, and that’s probably the biggest difference. What we come in and do every day is still basically the same.\nThe last few weeks have been particularly busy because traffic is quite high across the whole ecosystem. But I think everybody in the digital currency space has been quite busy.\nBC: A lot of people use the blockchain explorer and comprehensive data your company provides. How popular are those feature services?\nPS: The blockchain explorer and charts and data from our site sees a couple of million unique active users regularly.  \nBC: Since the beginning of January have you guys seen a significant increase in wallet users?\nPS: I think the growth over the last six months has been particularly strong. Not just seeing this with people using our feature services but we’ve also seen a lot of market share appreciation which is great to see. I think the price is always exciting, but for us, we define how well we’re doing by how well we do through the normal periods rather than just the big run ups. Anyone can run a successful ski resort when it’s snowing during the year, but the better question is how do you run a successful ski resort when it snows very little. So for us what we focus on is seeking out very consistent growth. \n\nI think the most special thing about our company is we’ve been able to grow and expand even when the overall market is lagging. That’s what we are trying to track very closely.      \n\nBC: From your perspective at Blockchain do you see Bitcoin demand slowing down anytime soon?\nPS: Certainly, haven’t seen that happen yet.\nBC: What’s your overall opinion of the state of the network right now?\nPS: I think it’s clear that we need to scale the network. I’ve been very public about that, and how we should scale the network and of course Blockchain is a strong supporter of the New York agreement. Blockchain is looking forward to seeing that activated over the next couple of months.\nWhat do you think about the software platform Blockchain raising $40 million?

    "text": "\n CNBC journalist Seema Moody recently published a report detailing the trials and tribulations of her attempt to live for a week solely using bitcoin as currency. This report, and others like it, fail to represent the actual ease with which one can exclusively use bitcoin as a money commodity, and spreads myths about the impracticality of cryptocurrency as a mean of exchange.\nAlso Read: State-Funded Bitcoin Data Center Infuriates Montana Locals\n\nSeema Moody’s report details her apparently arduous experience of attempting to live for a week solely using bitcoin as currency. The report opens with the Moody complaining that are no bars in New York that accept bitcoin, before moving to a montage of her dangling various items at several confused retailers whilst asking if she can purchase their products using bitcoin. Seema then purchases food from a couple of eateries, declaring the fees involved to add an additional 30 and 70 percent on top of the regular price. Transportation is presented as a challenge, but it is conceded that Uber credits can be purchased via a third party company using bitcoin.\n\nAs the week progresses Seema Moody starts to purchase gift cards online via bitcoin in order to make basic purchases, and finds someone on the internet who is willing to sell her a public transportation card in exchange for bitcoin. Moody ultimately concludes that bitcoin is a cumbersome and challenging medium of exchange that requires the constant seeking and interaction with third parties in order to facilitate basic purchases. It is determined that her week-long experiment incurred an additional expense of 40% percent when compared to cash.\nSeema is not the first journalist to document the supposed struggle of attempting to live exclusively using bitcoin as currency. Kashmir Hill produced a similar story for Forbes in May 2013, making the same conclusions pertaining to the hassles of obtaining basic staples such as food using bitcoin. The concept was again dredged up by CNN’s Morgan Spurlock in 2015, the year after the release of ‘Life on Bitcoin‘ – a documentary made by a honeymooning couple seeking to travel and live solely on bitcoin.\nReports Like Moody’s Cultivate a Fallacy Pertaining to Bitcoin’s Ease of Use\nAlthough seeing bewildered journalists stumbling through a city, accosting shop owners about technology they have not heard of may make for entertaining viewing, such creates an absurd myth pertaining to the challenges of using bitcoin in day-to-day life.\nSaid ‘experiments’ conveniently forget to mention the existence of debit card providers such as Xapo, that allow you to pay for items from your bitcoin holdings using conventional card swipe and 3D Secure technology.\nIf one chooses to use a product such as Xapo’s (or Coinbase’s similar debit card) the only barrier to them making purchases would be a business failing to provide eftpos facilities (the typical Visa/Mastercard point-of-sale solutions most modern stores host). The reporting in question also ignores the sole purpose of bitcoin ATM machines, which allow users to convert bitcoin holdings into cash in the absence of businesses that accept bitcoins.\nThe use of services like those mentioned above would dramatically reduce the fees that Moody experienced. Reports like Moody’s choose to ignore these services, likely because watching a journalist walk around using an eftpos card at businesses and ATMs machines would not make for compelling viewing.\n\nThe report also fails to make mention of the hardship that many of the world’s underbanked struggle through in attempting to conduct basic purchases. The challenges of being able to access food and transport is a daily reality for the world’s 2 billion un- or underbanked citizens, with many being completely locked out of the global economy due to the corruption or absence of financial institutions. For many, the challenges of being unable to access services that Moody imposed on herself through not visiting bitcoin ATMs are an everyday consequence of being born into a society with a poorly developed banking system.\nThe price volatility of bitcoin is also cited by Moody as a major barrier to widespread adoption as a means of exchange. Although recent price action shows an inarguable volatility, greater bitcoin adoption will over time have a stabilizing effect upon its price. The larger bitcoin user-base the more selling or buying pressure is required to move the price, and if bitcoin were to begin to see significant retail uptake, the constant trading of bitcoin created by merchants seeking to realize profit would increasingly tighten the range of bitcoin’s price swings. This type of stabilization will not occur tomorrow, but over a long period as cryptocurrency becomes increasingly embedded in society, just as the internet became increasingly embedded into the fabric of everyday life in a slow yet sustained fashion.\nThe argument regarding bitcoin’s value ignores the millions of citizens who struggle to make basic purchases due to their national currencies suffering from hellish hyperinflation. The drastic and often daily losses of value seen by currencies such as Argentina’s, Venezuela’s and Zimbabwe’s in recent years make bitcoin’s price volatility appear tame by comparison\nWith bitcoin continuing to generate attention from mainstream media outlets, it is unfortunately likely we will see more journalists bumbling through malls with a smartphone in hand, searching for bitcoin-accepting retailers in a bid to comically disprove the efficiency of bitcoin as a money commodity.\n\nDo you think that bitcoin is effective as a form of money?

    "text": "\n This week the 18-year old entrepreneur, Erik Finman, did an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on a technology subreddit where he details his experiences investing in bitcoin, which led to him becoming a millionaire by age 18.\nAlso Read: Australian Financial Authorities Look Into Ethereum’s Conflicts of Interest\nEighteen-Year-Old Entrepreneur Makes His First Million Investing in BTC \nBitcoin millionaire Erik Finman. \nAt age twelve Erik Finman put the $1000 his grandmother gave him in bitcoin, in May of 2011. By the end of 2013 Finman’s wealth in BTC grew to be worth $100,000 and the young high school student left his high school to create his own company. The company Finman created was called Botangle, a peer-to-peer tutoring service that offers video chat. In 2015 the young entrepreneur found a buyer who was interested in purchasing his company for either $100,000 or 300 BTC.\n“The investor offered either $100,000 or 300 bitcoin, which had dropped in value at that time to a little more than $200 a coin,” explains Finman’s AMA. “I took the lower cash value bitcoin deal because I believed it was the next big thing and an official buyout would’ve been very difficult for someone under eighteen and it was good tax planning to use Bitcoin.”\nThe Proud Owner of 403 Bitcoins \nFinman’s first venture, Botangle, was funded by BTC he bought when he was twelve.\nEven after his parents let him leave high school (Finman was later homeschooled) to pursue his career in 2015 they told him he didn’t have to attend college if he made his first million by the time he turned eighteen. Through day trading Finman accumulated more bitcoins from the original 300 BTC sale and used some of the funds to create his own virtual reality headset company. In 2017 Finman became a millionaire at eighteen with his BTC holdings and his parents once again let him skip going to school.\n“I can say today that I own 403 bitcoins which are currently valued at $1,092,678.08 with the price per Bitcoin being at $2,711.36 plus some other money invested in other things,” Finman details.\n\nCan’t have all your eggs in one basket! So I won the bet!\n\nMainstream Media Puts Finman Through ‘Rigorous Proof Verification and Fact Checking’\nFinman’s first investment in bitcoin at age twelve got him featured in many articles from publications like Mashable. The self-made millionaire says this time around the news outlet CNBC put him through “rigorous proof verification and fact checking” to verify his latest story. During the AMA many people considered Finman lucky, while others said he made some really good investment choices.\nAfter CNBC had run the story on Finman, he told the public he kept his bitcoins “super secure,” and “spread out across multiple wallets and multiple machines,” he explains. Finman details that going public with his most recent story has made him “paranoid,” and was scared the media attention would make him a target.\nWhat do you think about Finman’s success investing in bitcoin and making his first million at eighteen.

    "text": "\n The cryptocurrency hedge fund industry has significantly expanded in recent years. The meteoric rise in the price of bitcoin has solidified the success of many of these hedge funds, with reports suggesting that cryptocurrency hedge funds are outperforming their mainstream counterparts.\nAlso Read: Cryptocurrency Hedge Fund Polychain Raises $10 Million\nCryptocurrency Hedge Funds Have Outperformed the Average Global Hedge Fund\nThe cryptocurrency economy has become increasingly embedded in the traditional financial markets, including the emergence of several cryptocurrency hedge funds in recent years.\n\nEurekahedge was one of the first companies to offer cryptocurrency-based hedge funds, launching its Crypto-Currency Fund Index in 2013. Despite the cryptocurrency bear market of 2014 and the immense volatility within the cryptocurrency markets, Eurekahedge has managed to perform with an average annual return of 123.25%. Eurekahedge’s Crypto-Currency Fund Index tracks the performance of several different actively managed cryptocurrency hedge funds that are predominantly invested in bitcoin and ethereum, in addition to several other prominent cryptocurrency projects.\nEurekahedge has recently stated that “cryptocurrency hedge funds have outperformed the average global hedge fund, traditional FX hedge fund strategies, the MSCI ACWI and the S&P GS Precious Metals Index over all periods.”\nPantera Capital was founded in 2013, and claims to have been the first U.S. bitcoin investment firm. The company emerged out of Pantera Capital Management LP, a San Francisco-based investment firm that was founded in 2003. Pantera boasts a portfolio that includes many of the most successful companies in the cryptocurrency economy, including blockchain-based remittance provider Abra, major bitcoin exchange Bitstamp, bitcoin payment gateway Circle, and major altcoins Ripple and Zcash – both of which have seen dramatic price rises this year.\nWith Bitcoin’s Price Continuing to Rise, We Can Likely Expect Further Proliferation of Cryptocurrency Hedge Funds in Coming Years\nAnother high-profile entrant in the cryptocurrency hedge fund market is Polychain Capital, which was founded last year by Olaf Carlson-Wee, a former employee of Coinbase.  In September 2016 Polychain Capital generated media attention following its successful $10 million USD funding campaign conducted with venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures.\n\nPolychain capital holds actively managed portfolios of blockchain assets. Carlson-Wee discussed Polychain’s portfolio with Forbes, stating that “There will be many types of assets codified into the blockchain, and they are all not just going to be on the Bitcoin blockchain – it’s going to be a number of different assets here. And the best way to invest in that is with a diversified portfolio.” Since launching, there has been a high demand for Polychain Capital’s digital assets.\nDespite the high performance of the cryptocurrency hedge funds, some cryptocurrency adopters have argued that the increasing presence of major investment firms within the virtual currency space undermines the decentralization of the bitcoin markets.\nWith bitcoin’s price continuing to rise, we can likely expect further proliferation of cryptocurrency hedge fund in coming years.\nWould you invest in a cryptocurrency hedge fund?

The up-market home features eight bedrooms, six bathrooms, and is located right by the Westwood Plateau Golf and Country Club in Coquitlam. The listing features an asking price of 1,075 bitcoins – approximately $2.9 million USD.\n\nWith an asking price of nearly $3 million USD and such a narrow marketing strategy, the listing immediately aroused curiosity following its discovery by local British Columbia-based news outlet, The Tri-City News. Although no information is listed pertaining to the property’s owner, the home is listed through Vallee Real State Agent Group, with Eric Vallee listed as the real estate agent to contact for inquiries.\nThe Tri-City News attempted to make contact with Eric Vallee, only to be told that Vallee was out of the office for the week, however another employee called Val Petrov was to handle all inquiries in the mean time. Val Petrov refused to discuss the property with The Tri-City News – who reported that Petrov abruptly stated: “I have no comment” when asked about the property, before immediately terminating the phone call.\nThe Emergence of Two Extremely Similar, Unusual Listings Seems an Unlikely Coincidence\nThe property is not the first luxury residence situated in Coquitlam that has been advertised via an overseas Craigslist listing with an asking price quantified in cryptocurrency. Just last month, a five-bedroom, five-bathroom ‘executive-style’ 5,000 square foot property was discovered listed on the Hong Kong Craigslist website, with an asking price of 2,099 bitcoins – approximately $4 million USD at the time. The realtor handling the listing, Mario Figliola of Sutton Centre Realy, told The Tri-City News that the listing was a joke. A few days later The Tri-City News reports being contacted by the manager of Sutton Centre Realty, Derek Drew, who described the advert as an “honest mistake that never should have been made.”\n\nThe emergence of two extremely similar, unusual listings advertising luxury Coquitlam homes on East Asian Craiglist websites seems an unlikely coincidence. The Real Estate Council of British Columbia told The Tri-City News that bitcoin cannot be held in trust during a real estate transaction, as virtual currency presently sits outside of the regulatory guidelines applied to banks and government institutions. As such, Canadian real estate sales in bitcoin could risk running afoul of the Financial Transaction and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC) reporting requirements, bringing the legality of said property listings into contention.\nWould you buy or sell a house using bitcoin?

The Italian Minister of Economy initiated discussion pertaining to the draft legislation in December 2016. The modified law, AML4, was introduced in Italy with its publication in the Italian Official Journal of the Legislative Decree 25th May 2017.\n\nThe proposed legislation contains numerous articles that directly address cryptocurrencies, in addition to introducing a specific registry for Virtual Currency Exchanges.\nThe current legislative decree recognized by the European Commission defines virtual currency as “a digital representation of value that is neither issued by a central bank or a public authority, nor attached to a legally established fiat currency which can be used as a means of exchange for the purchase of goods and services and transferred, stored and traded electronically.” Cryptocurrency exchanges are defined as virtual service providers: “any natural or legal person providing professional services to third parties for the use, the exchange, the storage related of virtual currencies and for the conversion from or in currencies having legal tender[.]”\nThe Proposed Decree Mandates That Virtual Currency Providers Gain Licensed Authorization From the Nation State in Which They Are Based\nThe proposed amendments defines a virtual currency ‘exchanger’ as a “[provider] engaged primarily and professionally in exchange services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies”.\n\nAlthough the changes are subtle, the classification of virtual currency exchanges as entities differing from conventional money exchanges allows the development of tailored policy designed to address potential issues specific to virtual currency exchanges.\nThe proposed decree mandates that virtual currency providers gain licensed authorization from the nation state in which they are based. “Member States shall ensure that providers of exchanging services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies, custodian wallet providers, currency exchange and cheque cashing offices, and trust or company service providers are licensed or registered, and that providers of gambling services are regulated.”\nExperts are expecting the European Parliament will likely vote on the provisions sometime after October 2017.\nDo you think that the European Parliament will pass the Italian anti-money laundering laws?

Barclay CEO, Ashok Vaswani, told CNBC that Barclays previously has met with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Britain’s chief regulatory watchdog overseeing the fintech industry, to discuss virtual currency regulations.\n\nAlthough the discussion began specifically on the topic of blockchain technology, the interview soon turned to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. “I’ve actually gone… to the FCA, to talk about how we could bring… cryptocurrencies into play”, Ashok Vaswani told CNBC.\nDespite Barclays’ evident interest in the cryptocurrency markets and economy, the CEO appears to view virtual currencies with cautious optimism. “Obviously [it’s] a new area, an arena we’ve got to be careful with. We are working our way through it.”\nAdvocating for a Permissive Regulatory Apparatus for the Cryptocurrency Markets\nThe executive director of strategy for the FCA, Chris Woolard, has recently iterated that businesses and institutions must adopt a cautious approach when dealing with cryptocurrency but also stressed that FCA has not taken a prohibitory stance with regards to bitcoin and blockchain technology. “We don’t prohibit regulated firms from engaging in digital currency trading, nor do we prohibit banks from offering banking services to deal with currency firms that use [blockchain]. I am not saying that we view digital currencies as an inherently bad thing… but we do have to exercise a degree of caution.”\nOutside of announcing Barclays’ meetings with the FCA, Ashok Vaswani gave little elaboration on future plans the bank may have for further engagement within the cryptocurrency space. Barclays partnered with social payments app Circle last year, which facilitates the transmission of funds via messenger app and features support for bitcoin transactions.\n\nBarclays is among a growing number of large financial institutions who are advocating for a permissive regulatory apparatus for the cryptocurrency markets. Despite pressure from the fintech industry, many commentators are predicting that it will take governments years to develop a comprehensive legal framework designed for the unique challenges and opportunities that bitcoin and other virtual currencies present.\nDo you think that major banks showing an interest in bitcoin is positive for the network, or do you think that greater involvement in cryptocurrency by major financial institutions undermines the core values of bitcoin?

Of the 41% of respondents who were familiar with the technology underpinning bitcoin, 80% stated that they did not understand how blockchain technology operates.\n\nThe survey polled 2,000 HSBC customers from the United Kingdom, in addition to 1,000 participants from Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and the United States respectively.\nHSBC’s report adds to a growing list of surveys that indicate bitcoin and blockchain technology is still in its early years of development, with early-majority adoption still yet to be seen.\nA survey conducted by Cambridge University this year determined the current number of unique active users of cryptocurrency wallets is estimated to be between 2.9 and 5.8 million. Despite representing just 0.04 – 0.05% of the global population, this data indicates that the bitcoin userbase has at least doubled in just two years. With such a tiny percentage of citizens actively engaged in the bitcoin community, 40% of citizens being aware of blockchain technology evidences the enormous growth potential of cryptocurrency.\nDespite the Recent Media Coverage, Majority Still Unfamiliar With Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology\nMonex, Inc., Tradestation Securities, Inc., and Monex Boom Securities (H.K) Limited released a survey this month that polled retail investors holding accounts with China, Japan, and the United States respectively. The results showed that only 3% of Japanese and US retail investors are actively investing in cryptocurrency, with 10% of Chinese investors reporting that they were investing in cryptocurrency. 20% of Chinese and US-based retail investors reported that they were not at all familiar with cryptocurrency. Nearly all polled Japanese investors had heard of bitcoin and cryptocurrency, likely owing to Japan’s highly publicized liberal legal apparatus surrounding cryptocurrency.\n\nDespite the recent spike in bitcoin’s media coverage, it would appear that the majority of people are still unfamiliar with bitcoin and blockchain technology. With consumer polls in developed nations indicating that 59% of citizens are still unfamiliar with blockchain technology and only a small minority of retail investors are actively involved in the Japanese, Chinese and US cryptocurrency markets, it would appear that bitcoin still has enormous growth potential.\nDo you think bitcoin is approaching early mainstream adoption, or is bitcoin still in its nascent years?

However, when he woke up and logged into Bittrex, he noticed his holding were being sold, and his account was missing 7 BTC which was withdrawn to an unknown address.\n“Everyone’s worst nightmare concerning trading is losing their wealth to thieves,” explains the Bittrex trader.\n\nLast night I was in the nightmare, and what’s worse is I had to fight while they tried to take my last four Bitcoin.\n\nShayne Vows to Never Store Large Amounts of Digital Currency on Exchanges \nDuring the recorded video the trader and his buddy were logged into the Bittrex account while the thief was siphoning his digital assets. The victim thought the hacker might have been a bot or script program that worked very fast to sell his altcoins at spot price and then withdrew the bitcoins after each sale. The “fight” Shayne described, shows the trader continuously stopping open orders and trying to remove the remaining digital assets held on Bittrex. Every time he tried to cancel the order the hacker or bot was able to resume selling the remaining digital assets, but Shayne was able to recover 4 BTC in the end.\nShayne and his trading partner watching their Bittrex account get siphoned.\n“I think sometimes these things happen to make us stronger and to be very well prepared to help prevent it happening again — I know now I will never leave any large amounts on any exchange ever again,” details Shayne. “This lesson has been a very hard one and one I will never forget, but I will not give up, and I will come back even stronger again.”\n\nThis has now lit a fire under my ass and I will not let this beat me mentally. I hope you watch the video and you can take something from it and it makes you aware of how dangerous holding any coins on any exchange can be.\n\nAccidently Revealing API Keys Through Trading Videos \nThe interesting aspect of the occurrence was that Bittrex allowed multiple IP addresses to log into one account. Moreover, according to a follow-up post from Shayne, the trading platform Bittrex detailed the account was compromised due to the hacker gaining access to the trader’s API keys. “Checking your account history we can see however that these sales are happening through API calls,” explains Bittrex. Shayne details the API keys may have been leaked when he aired trading videos via his Youtube channel.\n“So it seems somehow my API keys were stolen. Now, this could have quite possibly been my fault as I have used API keys in video tutorials before and may have somehow deleted the wrong ones and not double checked before I uploaded the video,” Shayne concludes.\nThe story reaffirms the fact that people revealing their digital assets to the general public via social media, forums and Youtube videos clearly creates targets for hackers and unfortunately many victims of cryptocurrency theft.\n\nWhat do you think about Shayne’s loss on Bittrex and how he accidentally shared his API keys on video?

    "text": "\n Former Barclays chief executive and current UK shadow chair of the Institute for Apprenticeships, Antony Jenkins has warned that banks may become antiquated and irrelevant should they fail to embrace contemporary fintech solutions in a recent interview with CNBC.\nAlso Read: Barclays Want UK Government to Regulate Bitcoin\nMr. Jenkins Suggested That Emerging Financial Technologies Pose an Existential Challenge to Traditional Banks\nAntony Jenkins warned that banks may become subject to creative destruction should they fail to embrace cryptocurrency technology. In a recent interview with CNBC, Mr. Jenkins suggested that adopting distributed ledger technologies could produce efficiency savings of between $80-$110 billion, and allow traditional financial institutions to be competitive with bitcoin and other emerging financial technologies.\n\n“We’re really at the end of the beginning of what we see as a revolution driven by technology with financial service… as the technologies develop and season, they’re going to create a totally different way of doing banking and financial services,” Jenkins told CNBC at the Money 20/20 Europe conference in Copenhagen. “Now we will see the possibility… [of] banks becom[ing] irrelevant to their customers. Banks can avoid that, but they have to act now, and what they really need to do is think about innovation, but also transformation, doing something radically different.”\nMr. Jenkins’ Remarks Come as the Bank He Previously Chaired Announced It Has Met With UK Regulators Regarding Cryptocurrency\nJenkins described cryptocurrencies and other breakthrough financial technologies as just the start of a major transformation of traditional banking practices. “This is just in the footprints of what’s going to happen here. As these technologies season and develop, we can imagine total transformation of the banking system, using blockchain for example, in a world where banks don’t really exist anymore.”\n\nAntony Jenkins’ remarks come at the same time as the bank that he previously chaired, Barclays, announced that it has been in direct communications with the UK Financial Conduct Authority with regards to developing a permissive regulatory framework for cryptocurrency businesses in the United Kingdom.\nRemarks such as those from Antony Jenkins and current Barclays CEO Ashok Vaswani illustrate the recent influx of leading figures in the mainstream finance industry seeking to embrace and profit from cryptocurrency technology. Despite the enthusiasm from the finance industry, many within the cryptocurrency remain skeptical about major global financial institutions utilizing blockchain technology – arguing that such may lead to blockchain and bitcoin technology being used as a tool for greater centralization and an augmentation in the global finance industry’s profits and power.\nDo you think that greater adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology by banks will undermine the core vales of bitcoin?

    "text": "\n After expanding services in Europe earlier this year, bitcoin payroll and wage payment service provider Bitwage announced its official launch in the UK on Monday.\nAlso read: Bitwage Launches New Functionality for European Customers\nBitwage’s Official Launch in the UK\nBitwage offers solutions for remote workers to receive wages in a variety of currencies including bitcoin. Using the service, workers can get paid in bitcoin without having to ask each employer to pay in the cryptocurrency or sign up with Bitwage. They simply give the employers Bitwage’s bank account details to receive payments in.\nBitwage claims to have over 13,000 registered workers and have processed over $21.6 million in international wages. Users can invoice employers or clients in the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), and the European Union (EU). Wages received can be split into any ratio between different bank accounts and bitcoin wallets.\nOn Monday, the company announced the official launch of their services in the UK, stating:\n\nWe are now able to offer workers anywhere in the world the ability to receive wages from companies in the UK through local banking partners. This means that our workers can receive wages through Faster Payments, Bacs, Chaps or Swift into local UK GBP bank accounts.\n\nBacs, Faster Payments, and Chaps Now Supported\nBitwage founder and president Jonathan Chester told Bitcoin.com that the company has been beta testing this service. He explained that although the ability to receive wages in British pounds (GBP) existed previously, it was not done locally and was never publicly launched. Without local UK partners, the service was not cost-effective. Chester detailed:\n\nBefore this, we had a banking partner with GBP correspondent accounts in Ireland that could receive Chaps, but not Faster Payments or Bacs. This was a costly solution for potential clients in the UK, so there was very little usage. We have now been working with these same customers during the beta testing of our new local UK services.\n\nChaps is the UK’s same-day high-value payment system, currently used by 26 direct participants including the Bank of England and over 5,000 indirect participants. Payments are transferred over Swift and settled intraday in central bank funds. In 2016 Chap’s volumes reached a record 39 million transactions, worth £75.6 trillion.\nBacs is responsible for the clearing and settlement of UK automated payment methods, direct debit and Bacs direct credit. The company processed 6.22 billion transactions to UK bank accounts in 2016, worth £4.8 trillion. Faster Payments is a UK banking initiative which uses the Bacs system to reduce payment times between different banks’ customer accounts from three working days to a few hours. While Chaps focuses on same-day service for high-value transactions, Faster Payments is tailored to the much larger number of smaller payments.\nBitwage’s Growing List of Services\nIn April, Bitcoin.com reported on Bitwage launching unique IBANs for users receiving wages in the European Union. With Monday’s launch in the UK, employers can pay in US dollars, British pounds, and euros. In addition, Bitwage can accept Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Swiss Francs, and Japanese yen.\nPayouts to the workers are far more diverse and are done on the same or next day. Currencies supported include bitcoin, ether, and litecoin, as well as the US dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian Real, the Philippine peso, the Mexican peso, the Argentine peso, the Indian rupee, the Vietnamese dong, the Nigerian naira, and the Ukrainian hryvnia.\nWould you use Bitwage to receive your wages?

The company detailed plans to integrate with Coinbase, and Ms. Johnson also revealed Fidelity’s in-house cafeteria accepts the cryptocurrency for food and drinks. Now the company has published it’s annual Fidelity Charitable 2017 Giving Report which details how charitable donations made in bitcoin is on the rise.\nFidelity’s 26-page report details that a lot of people are donating with non-publicly traded assets and a very popular contribution method is bitcoin. In the first six months of 2017 Fidelity Charitable received $9 million in BTC so far and that number has already surpassed 2016’s bitcoin donations by $2 million. The organization has turned over $3.1 billion in non-publicly traded assets like real estate, life insurance policies and even grain. The digital asset bitcoin has been used for Fidelity’s philanthropic funds and grants since 2015.\nFidelity Charitable received $7 million in bitcoin donations in 2016. In 2017 bitcoin donations so far add up to $9 million.\nBitcoin Currently Being Used to Help Sichuan Landslide Victims in China\nAnother good example of bitcoin being used for charity is how Chinese investors are using the cryptocurrency to donate to victims of the recent Sichuan province landslide that devastated the local community. On June 24 a landslide in south-western China in the Mao County region destroyed over 40 homes alongside reports of numerous deaths and people missing. According to the regional publication 8BTC a variety of cryptocurrency community members are donating bitcoins to Sichuan landslide victims.\nBitcoin proponents are donating BTC to Sichuan Landslide Victims. \nThe report reveals that the bitcoin mining device manufacturer, Canaan gave 32 BTC ($81,000) to the to Chengdu Charity Federation for landslide victims. The following day the hosts of a Chinese bitcoin video show, Jin Yangyang and Guo Hongcai, created a cryptocurrency fund for victims as well. The Chinese news outlet details that the donation addresses have seen a significant amount of donations over the past few days. Furthermore, bitcoin has been used in China for disaster relief for quite some time. In 2013 the One Foundation led by the celebrity Jet Li got more than 230 BTC during the earthquake that hit Lushan, Sichuan, China.\nWhat do you think about the rise of bitcoin being used for charitable donations?

Despite its Russian success, Alpari has seen significant struggles in recent years – following the insolvency of its UK entity and the revocation of the company’s United States National Futures Association and subsequent exit from the US markets.\nThe introduction of bitcoin derivatives trading is of prescient timing for Alpari, following recent announcements that Russia is developing a regulatory framework for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

    "text": "\n These days bitcoin continues to outperform many traditional assets as the decentralized currency has become the premiere digital asset class of the 21st century. There are many ways individuals can obtain bitcoins and hold the appreciating investment themselves. However, there are also other traditionalized methods where people can invest in cryptocurrencies through trusts, self-directed IRAs, hedge funds, and other investment vehicles.\nAlso Read: Markets Update: Bitcoin Bulls Are Back Testing Key Resistance Levels\nIn 2017 Bitcoin Visibility Increases Among Mainstream Investors and Traditional Fund Managers\nBitcoin’s performance as an asset class continues to outshine traditional investments like stocks, precious metals, and the bond market. Just recently the well-known mainstream financial publication Bloomberg called bitcoin an “exchange traded fund (ETF) on steroids.” Furthermore, people have found that there are other ways to invest in bitcoin which are similar to traditional individual retirement accounts (IRA), or stock market investments. This includes cryptocurrency based investment trusts, exchange-traded notes and many more types of methods.\n\nSo far in 2016 and the past six months of 2017 cryptocurrency funds have soared in value considerably compared to traditional assets. Some of these traditional investment rails just offer bitcoin while others offer a basket of cryptocurrencies that can sometimes outperform one single digital asset if managed properly.\nBK Capital Management\nThe BKCM investment asset fund was created by CNBC host and investment analyst Brian Kelly. The firm specializes in the macro-economics of digital assets and offers mainstream investors exposure to currencies like bitcoin. BKCM says its managers are fluent in “traditional capital markets, blockchain assets, and technology experience.” According to the company’s website, the fund focuses on “liquid exchange” digital assets. Kelly has been an active proponent of bitcoin and other emerging digital assets throughout many of his broadcasts on the network CNBC.\nThis Spring BKCM was up 68% in April and 172% YTD according to the company’s reports.\nGrayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) is a fund run by the Digital Currency Group’s (DCG) Barry Silbert. The DCG founder Silbert has been well known among investment circles when he created the brokerage firm Secondmarket and since then focused his efforts towards cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups. The publicly quoted GBTC is an easy way for investors to get exposure to bitcoin and can be purchased through traditional self-directed IRAs. The Bitcoin Investment Trust has outperformed the S&P 500, gold shares, and treasury bonds by gaining 220.59 percent this year. Moreover, GBTC shares trade at a premium compared to an individual purchasing bitcoin traditionally through an exchange. Alongside this, Grayscale also offers an Ethereum Classic fund that is similar to GBTC. The ECX Index is eligible to be held in an IRA, Roth IRA, and other investment accounts.\nGBTC sees considerable gains over the past year. \nArk Investment Management\nArk Innovation (ARKK) is a fund that invests in innovative technologies and companies, as well as funds like GBTC. Ark investment says they see the internet, mobile, and other technologies transforming the world’s business models. “We’re believers in bitcoin, the currency, and Bitcoin, the technology platform,” explains Ark’s Founder and Chief Investment Officer Cathie Wood. Currently, Ark has four ETF’s for investors to choose from which include the Industrial Innovation ETF, Web x.0 ETF, Genomic Revolution Multi-Sector ETF, and the Innovation ETF.\nArk Innovation’s one year chart shows a significant spike over the past six months.\nSelf-Directed IRAs\nThere are other ways investors can add bitcoin to their portfolios like self-directed IRAs. The California-based company Bitcoin IRA allows you to purchase bitcoins or ethereum with traditional IRAs or a 401K. The firm’s offering is a modest interest bearing account that utilizes the high returns from ETH and BTC markets. Other self-directed IRAs can allow people to purchase bitcoin as well through companies like the Millennium Trust, Entrust Group, and Pensco. “Technology is having a transformative effect on our daily lives, and the alternative investment industry is no different,” explains Millennium Trust.\n\nMainstream Investment funds and IRAs That Include Bitcoin Are Prospering\nThere are many other ways mainstream investors can gain exposure to bitcoin rather than purchasing it directly, and more are popping up in great number. Just recently Bitcoin.com reported on Britain’s largest online trading platform, Hargreaves Lansdown, which has announced it will allow its customers to invest in bitcoin. The firm commands over £70bn of investors funds and will allow its 876,000 customers access to the decentralized currency. With cryptocurrencies performing so well and gaining in value exponentially many more mainstream funds and IRAs are likely to include digital assets for their customer’s portfolios. While there are no ‘official’ Securities and Exchange Commission approved ETFs at the moment there are still plenty of similar investment options in 2017.\nWhat do you think about these funds and IRAs?

They may need reassurance or moral support, and that is exactly why Breadwallet CMO Aaron Lasher launched the Bitcoin Therapy Hotline. \nAlso read: Class Action Lawsuit Filed Against Cryptocurrency Exchange Kraken\nAaron Lasher, CMO Breadwallet\nHis post on Breadwallet’s blog read, “Recently, the bitcoin community has seen a lot of infighting surrounding competing ideologies and plans for governance, which can leave even the most casual of bitcoiners frustrated, confused, or in a crisis of identity.” Lasher continued, “In an attempt to offer some clarity and support to the bitcoin community as a whole, today we are launching the Bitcoin Therapy Hotline (BTH).”\nIs this Some kind of Joke? Details of the Hotline\nOn knee jerk reaction, some people would think this therapy hotline was some kind of practical joke. Bitcoin.com reached out to Lasher to investigate if it was a joke or a sincere attempt at helping people. Lasher said,\n\nIs it 100% serious? No. Is it 100% a joke? No. It’s a real line and I’ll talk to anybody who wants to get something off their chest about the bitcoin world.\n\nLasher said he started the hotline for a specific reason. He said, “I’ve always mused over how people are more civil in persona than on the internet, and saw this as an opportunity to expose myself in a small way, make myself available for worthwhile discussions. The hotline is also free for anyone to call and Breadwallet does not have expectations of compensation for services rendered.\nLimitations of the Bitcoin Therapy Hotline; The Number to Seek Help\nEven though Lasher mentioned he will discuss anything with anyone regarding bitcoin woes, his blog did offer some guidelines and limitations. The blog entry said it is not a customer support hotline, nor are anyone who answers licensed therapists. There is also a chance discussions may be limited to 10 minutes due to high demand for the service.\nHowever, as it stands, the line is open and available to bitcoiners…and when someone calls, they will likely be greeted with a friendly, “Bitcoin Therapy Hotline, how can I help”!\nThe number to the hotline is posted on their blog.

    "text": "\n On July 7th the mining pool BTC.com mined a block that contained a transaction with an 80 BTC fee attached. BTC.com believes the fee was an accident as the transaction fee should have been around 2 BTC and the pool is looking to give the sender a refund.\nAlso Read: How Much Does it Cost to Run a Full Node?\nBTC.Com Finds an 80 BTC Fee and Offers to Pay the User Back \nThe China-based mining pool BTC.com was surprised to find a transaction in a block they mined tethered to an 80 BTC fee ($200,000 USD). The accidental fee is a large one, but this type of incident has happened many times over the years. The mining pool says they are not interested in keeping the money and would like to pay the user back if they can verify it was their transaction.\n“Recently, BTC.com mined a block containing a transaction that carried a staggering 80BTC fee,” explains the mining pool’s blog post. “Obviously, something’s up with that. All things said and done; the correct fee should have been approximately 2 BTC.”\n\nIf that was your transaction, we want to help. We’re not interested in making a quick buck, especially if it comes at the loss of another bitcoiner. That’s why we’re reaching out. Again, if you are the person in question, let us help you get your funds back.\n\nThe Curious Case of Accidental Fees \nAccidental fees have happened many times throughout bitcoin’s existence. Back in April of 2016, the Bitclub Network mined block #409,008 which had a 291 BTC fee attached to a transaction. At the time the transaction was worth roughly $135,000, and no one ever came forward to claim ownership after Bitclub said they would give the fee back. Following this incident, the Bitclub mining pool donated half the funds to the Bitcoin Foundation.\nThis past March Bitcoin.com reported on a Bitmain customer who overpaid 2.5 BTC in a transaction mined by the company’s Antpool. The accidental fee sender took his story to cryptocurrency forums, and the pool gave the funds back to him.\n“First of all, this mistake was caused by himself, and we don’t take responsibility for this,” explains Bitmain’s customer support. “But thank you for all of your support and unconditional trust for Antpool and Bitmain, our company has decided to pay his loss.”\nPaying Accidental Fees Back Is Not Required, but Many Pools Have Offered a Refund\nBack in 2013 the mining pool Asicminer found an overpaid 200 BTC fee. According to reports the pool’s operator “Friedcat” refunded the fee soon after finding the block. At the time bitcoin community members called Friedcat a hero for encouraging other pools to pay accidents like these back. In 2014 BTC Guild found an accidental 30 BTC transaction and gave the user back a fraction of the loss.\nMiners don’t have to fix these mistakes or reimburse people for fee errors, but most of them have paid them back or have offered to when these issues arise.\nWhat do you think about the 80 BTC fee BTC.com found?

    "text": "\n A Swiss investment certificate that tracks the price of bitcoin is gaining popularity with investors. The Vontobel bitcoin certificate is one of the most-traded structured products on Switzerland’s largest stock exchange, according to a local publication.\nAlso read: Britain’s Largest Broker Offers Exchange-Traded Bitcoin Investments\nStrong Demand for Bitcoin Tracker Certificates\nThe Vontobel bitcoin tracker certificate was launched in 2016 and is listed on Switzerland’s largest stock exchange, the Six Swiss Exchange. Since its launch, the firm saw “considerable demand” for the tracker certificate and subsequently raised its issue size a couple of times. On Thursday, a Swiss/German-language daily newspaper published by the NZZ Media Group, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, reported:\n\nThe certificate is a success: On many days it is the most traded structured product on the Swiss stock exchange. The initially small issue volume of the certificate with a term of two years was quickly increased to CHF 20 million and now increased to CHF 40 million.\n\nThe product trades under the symbol ZXBTUV with bitcoin priced in USD as the underlying asset. The certificate has a two-year term. The first day of trading was on July 15, 2016, and the last day of trading will be on July 16, 2018. “Between those dates, investors will be able to trade the Vontobel certificate on the secondary market, i.e. buying or selling at the applicable bid/offer prices,” the firm explained. Roger Studer, Head of Vontobel Investment Banking, said this bitcoin certificate “will for the first time give investors a simple and transparent means of investing in bitcoins on the Six Swiss Exchange.” Redemption is in cash, equal to the price of bitcoin at the certificate’s maturity.\nAttraction to Vontobel Bitcoin Tracker Certificates\nEstablished in 1924, Swiss private bank Vontobel specializes in wealth and asset management for private clients and institutional investors. With 21 international locations, the firm also offers investment and private banking services. At the end of 2016, it held CHF 195 billion of client assets.\nCiting the complexity of acquiring digital currencies, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung wrote that “there are a lot of questions to ask the potential investor such as: what crypto you should buy, should you do it directly on a stock exchange or with a broker, do you need a web wallet for the coins, and what to do with the elliptical code.”\nThese questions are why bitcoin tracker certificates and similar standardized investment products are welcomed by Swiss investors, the publication quoted an asset manager saying. Investors in Switzerland feel that trading bitcoins with a Swiss bank carries a significantly smaller risk, he continued, adding that “one does not have to invest on a bitcoin platform, which many asset managers consider unsafe.”\nMeanwhile, two other bitcoin tracker certificates are also gaining popularity globally. Bitcoin Tracker One and Bitcoin Tracker Eur issued by XBT Provider recently announced having achieved $100 million in assets under management, due to “rapidly escalating” demand from investors. This announcement followed the two products’ listing by Britain’s largest broker, Hargreaves Lansdown.\nWould you invest in Vontobel bitcoin tracker certificates?

    "text": "\n Next week the notorious Mt Gox CEO, Mark Karpeles, will be going to trial for the missing bitcoins lost on the exchange back in 2014. 850,000 BTC was removed from Mt Gox trading platform, and later Karpeles allegedly found 200,000 BTC kept in cold storage. Karpeles will face the Japanese court’s decisions concerning the rest of the $1.6 billion worth of BTC gone missing.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin’s Price Rise Brings Mt Gox Closer to Solvency\nInvestigating the Lavish Lifestyle of Mark Karpeles \nMark Karpeles 2017.\nBack in October of 2015, Mark Karpeles was arrested for allegedly exploiting the Mt Gox record books, and Tokyo prosecutors accused the CEO of embezzling funds. According to regional reports at the time, Tokyo Police initially arrested Karpeles for moving USD $1 Million in yen to his bank account. Further, many well known Japanese publications such as Yomiuri and Jiji detailed that Karpeles lived a posh lifestyle and had solicited “several women whom he met at venues that offer sexual services.” A few week’s prior to Karpeles October arrest the former Mt Gox executive also was caught moving $166,000 worth of yen to his personal account.\nA year later in July of 2016, a much thinner Karpeles was released by posting bail to the tune of $95,000 worth of yen. Karpeles has been a free man ever since but has been mandated to stay in Japan. Now, this Tuesday, July 11 Karpeles will face the Japanese prosecutor’s allegations that he embezzled some of the missing bitcoins. According to his lawyer, Kiichi Iino, Karpeles plans to plead not guilty to the charges against him. “He is keeping calm as the trial gets underway,” Karpeles lawyer explained to the Associated Press.\nKarpeles being released in 2016.\nThe Recent Visibility of ‘Magical Tux’ and the Known ‘Destination’ of the Missing Coins\nKarpeles has been very vocal on the Mt Gox subreddit forum and Twitter since his release. Even speaking about the possibility of Mt Gox becoming solvent due to bitcoin’s rising price on the Mt Gox insolvency subreddit. Prosecutors will investigate Karpeles assets and lifestyle before and after the Mt Gox bankruptcy. If any manipulation is found Japanese laws may not be so easy on Karpeles as the country has a 99 percent conviction rate.\nFurther, the trial comes at a time when the blockchain surveillance company Chainalysis explained to a group of U.S. Senators that they know the “destination” of the missing 650,000 BTC. “Chainalysis was the official investigator in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy case, and the destination of those coins is definitely known,” Chainalysis co-founder Jonathan Levin said this past June.\nSpecial Guest Protests\nAdditionally, Karpeles will have some guests at his trial like the creators of Mtgoxprotest.com, a website and a group of dedicated protestors that have been following the scandal since the insolvency started. Many bitcoin enthusiasts know the protestors/victims from their pictures on many tech magazine covers that reported on the story in 2014. On June 25 Kolin Burges reopened the site after it was hacked, and he says he plans on covering the Bankruptcy hearings and Karpeles trial again.\nMtgoxprotest.com is back. \n“It doesn’t seem to be very widely known for some reason, but the Karpeles criminal trial has been set for 11th July 2017 at the Tokyo District Court — There has been a lot of confusion over why the charges which have been brought so far only seem to cover a subset of the suspected illegal activities at Mt Gox,” Burges notes. “I’ll be attending the trial at least for the beginning. It would be good to see other creditors turn up. It will, of course, be in Japanese and I will be taking a lawyer/translator to help.”\nWhat do you think about Mark Karpeles upcoming criminal trial?

    "text": "\n Are criminals too stupid to use bitcoin? That is what a July 4 European Union report suggested. This will not strike many people as obvious, though. One of the most common concerns touted by governments about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is criminals will use them to fund their activities. \nAlso read: The Reason Why Bitcoin Miners Dedicate Time to Mining Empty Blocks\nThe EU’s commission Staff document detailed, “While they (criminals) may have a high intent to use due to VCs characteristics (anonymity in particular), the level of capability is lower due to high technology required.” This low level of capability implies criminals lack understanding of cryptocurrencies and have little technological acumen.\nFinancing Terrorism with Bitcoin Requires IT Expertise and Tech Skills\nAfter the report mentioned the low incidence of criminal use, it added terrorists may try to use “virtual currencies” like bitcoin to finance some operations. The report said the level of anonymity of virtual currencies provides a modicum of risk, because it plays into the hands of terror cells and other nefarious organizations. In other words, people with violent intentions can use these currencies in a secretive way to fund bombing campaigns or other violent activities. It currently seems unlikely, however, considering the technology is still developing/emerging, the report stated.\n“It is nevertheless important to mention that being currently a developing technology requiring IT skills and expertise, virtual currencies are not necessarily easy to use and the number of transactions is still quite low.”\nRegulation Vulnerability in the EU\nThe biggest fear the EU report pointed out centered on the regulation status of bitcoin and other “virtual currencies.” The fact that these cryptocurrencies are essentially unregulated means there are few reporting and tracking mechanisms in place. The report concluded since suspicious transactions cannot be monitored, are borderless, international, anonymous, and no one has duty to report strange activity to the Financial Intelligence Unit, the risk of vulnerability for financial terrorism remains high.\n\nThe inherent risk exposure is also very high due to the features of the virtual currencies (internet, crossborder and anonymity). Finally, the sector is currently not organised well enough to receive guidance or relevant information on AML/CFT requirements. Consequently, the level of TF vulnerabilities related to virtual currencies is considered as significant/very significant (level 3/4)\n\nAre criminals too stupid to use bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies? Share your thoughts in the comments section below!

    "text": "\n Polish authorities, regulators, and banks issued a sweeping statement warning of the risk of bitcoin, ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. They said these currencies are not national or legal tender and cannot be used to pay taxes. They do not fall within the guidelines provided by Polish Financial Supervision Authority. Businesses, especially, should be wary about adopting or trying to use “virtual currencies.” \nAlso read: Breadwallet Boots Up The Bitcoin Therapy Hotline\nThe authority’s warning read, “Polish National Bank and Financial Supervision Commission report that “virtual currencies” are not issued or guaranteed by the central bank of the state, not money, ie. They are not legal tender, or currency, can not be used to pay off tax liabilities and do not meet the criterion of general acceptance in retail outlets”\nThe article, however, did mention that “virtual currencies” currently do not violate EU or national law. They just allegedly harbor a laundry list of risks, and people should recognize these risks before getting involved in the digital currency landscape.\nPolish Authorities Outline Risks Involved with use of “Virtual Currencies”\nThe Polish authorities said that risk of theft is a huge problem in the space. This is especially the cause when an exchange is used to facilitate trade. “Virtual currencies” are not guaranteed by the bank either, since they are not bank deposits. The Polish authorities also said the currency is not “universally accepted” at retail outlets, and this makes it challenging to use and provides opportunities for being defrauded.\nLastly, the article said that these types of money may be nothing more than a “pyramid scheme.” In this regard, if an investor fell prey to this kind of scheme, the only kind of “protection would be criminal,” read the article. There is allegedly no legal institution that has an obligation to protect investors from this kind of dupe.\nAuthorities: Do Not Invest in Cryptocurrencies; Polish Bitcoin Usage\nThe Polish authorities say it would not be a wise investment to purchase these assets given their risk assessment. They are against using exchanges to purchase, manage, or otherwise be involved in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The site even said it would be risky if investors were regulated and added:\n\nThe Polish National Bank and Financial Supervision Commission considers that buying, owning and selling “currency” of virtual entities supervised by the financial Supervision Commission would be high risk and would not provide a stable and prudent management of the financial institution.\n\nThis warning comes as more Polish restaurants and eateries have begun to accept bitcoin as a method of payment. Poland’s largest food delivery service, with 5000+ restaurants, recently started accepting the digital currency. It will be interesting to see how the general public and investors react to recent condemnations of bitcoin and other digital currencies.\nWhat do you think about this statement from Polish regulators and bankers?  Let us know in the comments below.

    "text": "\n On July 10-11 after coasting along for over 72-hours above the US$2530 range the price of bitcoin took a significant dive to $2240. Bitcoin markets have rebounded slightly on July 12 and the price per BTC is now hovering around $2370 at the time of writing. Further many altcoin markets have seen bigger percentage drops as the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization has lost billions.\nAlso read: Bitcoin Helps Venezuelan Families Avoid Starvation\nCryptocurrency Market Capitalizations See a Significant Decline in Value  \nDigital currency markets have seen better days as nearly every cryptocurrency saw a bearish decline in value over the past two weeks. At the moment bitcoin’s price is staying above $2300 but some traders believe we could go under $2K soon, due to the next few months scaling uncertainty and a possible chain split. Alongside bitcoin’s drop in value, many altcoin markets suffered from significantly deeper corrections. The one-week bitcoin price average shows a loss of 8 percent, meanwhile, a vast amount of altcoins saw 10-50 percent losses. For instance, the second largest cryptocurrency market ethereum has declined roughly 27 percent over the course of the week and hit a low of $190 per ETH. However, ethereum markets have since rebounded as well on Wednesday roughly 15 percent to $225 ETH/USD.\nBTC/USD chart on 7/11/17 11:30 am EDT, six-month chart. \n‘Bitcoin Uncertainty Brings Doom and Gloom to the Whole Ecosystem’\nThis week Bitcoin.com spoke with Charles Hayter founder, and CEO of the cryptocurrency data analysis firm Crypto Compare about his thoughts on the current cryptocurrency markets’ decline. Hayter says there’s a lot going on right now in crypto-land with the recent ethereum ICO gold rush and possible bitcoin scaling events (UASF, Segwit2x) taking place this summer.\nBTC/USD chart on 7/11/17 11:30 am EDT, one-week chart. Courtesy of Crypto Compare.\n“A bear market has been in effect and certainly sentiment has switched away from the irrational exuberance that was leading people to buy ethereum and then rush into various ICO’s,” Hayter tells Bitcoin.com. “Some of the heat is coming out of recent rises – the feedback loop between the fiat on ramps to bitcoin and ethereum then on into ICO’s is seeing less volume so the supply and demand balance is out of kilter.”\n\nAltcoin markets have been the ones with a higher risk-reward ratio so operate on a higher beta than bitcoin — when the markets move the altcoins will move with more vigor in the direction of the trend. A rising tide lifts all boats but the opposite is also true. Although ethereum has had huge rises and is challenging bitcoin’s supremacy – bitcoin is still the gold standard of the crypto space and uncertainty surrounding its charted path brings doom and gloom to the whole ecosystem.\n\nA Bitcoin Split Could Cast a Shadow on Cryptos in General\nCharles Hayter, Crypto Compare founder.\nHayter says it’s hard to call the bottom right now for markets like ethereum and bitcoin. “One can look at technical levels for psychological reasons but these are momentary impulses in the market. Predicting when the market will turn with sentiment and for demand to become dominant is a shell game but you will start to see it in volume and general market chatter.”\nWe also discussed Hayter’s predictions if the bitcoin blockchain splits and the possible outcome of a Segwit implementation. “A chain split will create uncertainty — the only historic precedent is ethereum and ethereum classic — it’s possible to envision both scenarios of a loss or total gain in value.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty created across exchanges and wallets with the resultant main media fallout will certainly give a more negative taste to the whole experience and cast a shadow on cryptos in general.\n\nHayter believes a Segwit implementation could have a positive effect on markets by moving past the scaling issue temporarily. The Crypto Compare founder says,“Segwit does open up new opportunities for bitcoin and to have it implemented opens up options for development — to put the scaling issue to bed to a large degree will be positive as in the long term it re-unifies the bitcoin community.”\n“Instead of wasting firepower fighting for respective vested interests and ideals – energy can be invested in building the future,” Hayter concludes.\nWhat do you think is in store for bitcoin and the future of cryptocurrencies?

Its parent company, Swissquote Group Holding Ltd, is listed on the Six Swiss Exchange. “As Swissquote Bank is also a regulated bank, traders and partners benefit from the highest Swiss banking security and transparency standards,” according to the company’s website.\nWith a staff of over 500 serving customers in over 120 countries, the bank claims that “today, we rank among the top 10 online Forex brokers in the world, empowering over 200,000 private investors and institutional clients to trade a wide range of currencies, commodities and indices.”\n\nPartnership with Bitstamp\nTo facilitate bitcoin trading, the company has partnered with Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, which is the first and only bitcoin exchange to obtain a license from the European Union. “This is our first foray into the world of bitcoin,” Swissquote CEO Marc Bürki said, adding that “we wanted to work with a partner we could rely on. Bitstamp’s focus on regulation and compliance, as well as its payment institution licence, made it the standout choice for our needs.”\nBitstamp also made an announcement on Friday about the partnership, stating:\n\nSwissquote today launched BTC/EUR and BTC/USD trading on its platform, with Bitstamp providing full back-office support. There are plans to expand this partnership in the future, with Bitstamp bringing more of Swissquote’s services to its customers.\n\nThe bank explained that “Bitstamp provides pricing data and executes bitcoin transactions for Swissquote customers.”\nBitstamp believes that with bitcoin available in Swissquote customers’ domestic trading environment, “we are well on the way to achieving our long-term goal – the full integration of bitcoin with traditional financial services.”\nBitcoin Interest on the Rise\nIn Friday’s announcement, Bürki revealed:\n\nMany investors are interested in cryptocurrencies, but are afraid to trade them, because the players in this market are mostly little-known, and they often require the transfer of funds to a foreign account.\n\nSwissquote’s announcement came just a few days after another Swiss bank, Falcon Private Bank, announced that it will offer bitcoin asset management to their customers through a partnership with Bitcoin Suisse AG.

The letter seeks to inform that certain cryptocurrency investment activities may require licensing from the AFM, however, expresses “serious doubts” as to “whether managers of investment institutions in cryptos can meet the requirements for licensing.”\nAlso Read: Censorship, Bans, and ETH Scams: Twitter Suspends Bitmain’s Official Account\nDutch Financial Regulator Issues Letter to Investment Institutions Operating With Cryptocurrencies\nThe letter seeks to address individuals seeking to apply as an administrator of an investment institution in cryptos, in addition to “existing […] administrator[s] of an investment institution active in cryptos, or [individuals] planning an investment institution to manage cryptos.”\nThe AFM states that it is placing the “heavy requirements” on institutions investing in cryptocurrencies due to “strong concern[s]” as to whether managers of investment institutions who invest in cryptos are able to meet the full licensing requirements. The AFM’s concerns principally regard “the sharp increase in interest in new market parties to provide these services in combination with the usually limited knowledge about applicable regulations,” which generally results in “ignorance” as to how to meet “supervisory standards in practice.”\nThe AFM also requests that investment institution inform the agency regarding “any desired expansion of [cryptocurrency] product offering[s]” well in advance of providing such.\nLicensing Requirements for Dutch Investment Institutions\nThe AFM to clarify what circumstances in which the administrator for an investment institution will be required to seek licensing from the regulator. The letter states that the “threshold value for an administrator of (an) open-end investment institution (s) [is] €100 million [approximately $1,162 million USD].”\n“An administrator of an investment institution must obtain a number of important licenses to [meet] licens[ing] requirements,” the AFM continues. “These requirements are intended to include to protect the interests of retail investors and to ensure the proper functioning of retail investors market. No distinction is made between different forms of investing.”\nThe AFM has “drawn up a number of questions” that administrators of institutions invested in cryptocurrencies will be required to answer in order to apply for the required licensing. Said requirements pertain to the institution’s liquidity management, valuation protocols, the product development process, and storage considerations.\nWhat is your response to the AFM’s new licensing apparatus for institutions invested in cryptocurrencies?

    "text": "\n In recent regulatory news, the Shapeshift co-founder and chief operating officer, has given a damning appraisal of the current regulatory climate surrounding cryptocurrencies in the United States. The president of Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, Felix Hufeld, has indicated that the principal concern of German regulators regarding cryptocurrency will be seeking to ensure financial stability, rather than concerns pertaining to individual investors. The U.K’s Financial Conduct Authority has published an open letter to the CEO’s of businesses offering “services related to cryptoassets” regarding financial crime risks associated with virtual currencies.\nAlso Read: EOS Has Issues\nShapeshift Co-Founder Says U.S. Cryptocurrency Regulations are Worsening\nFollowing the passing of Bill 5031 in Washington and New York, which demands that cryptocurrency exchanges provide regulators with customer information and trading data, Shapeshift has emerged as one of the most vocal critics of the new, and the current direction in which U.S. cryptocurrency regulations are heading.\nIn a recent interview, Jon, Shapeshift’s co-founder and COO, stated “I would say in the US it’s actually gotten worse […] especially in the last 6 months. I think the explosion of value in 2017 brought a lot of these regulators into the space and made them more concerned. Most of them don’t understand what the heck it (cryptocurrency) is, but they want to control it.” Jon also accused regulators of failing to “give clarity,” stating “all these companies and lawyers and lobbyists are left to read the regulatory tea-leaves […] Nobody knows what the rules are and everyone’s just left to figure it out, that’s a dangerous place to be.”\nJon described decentralized exchanges as comprising a form of resistance to the current regulatory climate on the part of the cryptocurrency community. Of decentralized exchanges, the Shapeshift COO stated, “I think it’s a lesson to the smart regulators in the space that if they don’t work with companies, they’ll push things that way, and it’ll become harder and harder for them to have an impact in the space. The more regulators push hard, the more things become unregulatable.”\nJon concluded by advocating a collective approach among companies in the cryptocurrency sector to push for a more amenable regulatory apparatus, stating that he hopes “more and more of the crypto companies do band together to help educate the regulators in the space and try to work together to do something productive.”\nGerman Crypto Regulations Will Strive for Financial Stability, Not Protection of Individual Investors\nFelix Hufeld, the President of Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory (BaFin), recently delivered a speech addressing cryptocurrencies, in which he emphasized the regulator’s primary intention as being preserving financial stability, rather than issues concerning individual investors.\nAccording to a rough translation, Mr. Hufield stated “We will not be able to protect every single investor from his fate, and that can not be the task of state supervision. Once again, the maxim is that we must act on a prudent or regulatory basis if financial stability as a whole is threatened.”\nOverall, Mr. Hufield spoke favorably of cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology, stating that he “consider[s] the applications that start where there is a lack of effective control mechanisms or trustworthy institutions to be promising. Among other things in foreign trade or development aid, Blockchain’s promise of confidence and efficiency in cryptography and immutability may prove beneficial.”\nU.K. FCA Publishes Open Letter to CEOs of Businesses Offering “Services Related to Cryptoassets\nThe United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority has published an open letter to the CEOs of businesses that offer services pertaining to virtual currencies seeking to warn of the financial crime risks associated with cryptocurrencies.\nThe letter asserts that whilst “There are many non-criminal motives for using cryptoassets [..] this class of product can also be abused because it offers potential anonymity and the ability to move money between countries,” advocating that businesses “take reasonable and proportionate measures to lessen the risk of [firms] facilitating financial crimes which are enabled by cryptoassets.” Said measures include “developing staff knowledge and expertise on cryptoassets,” and “ensuring that existing financial crime frameworks adequately reflect the crypto-related activities which the firm is involved in.”\nMohammed Adil Siddiqui, compliance professional & founder of The CFD Trading & Compliance Forum, commented on the letter, stating, “The FCA’s recent notice to banks and financial institutions servicing the cryptocurrency sector comes as no surprise, it’s typical of the regulator‘s approach when things are getting from bad-to-worse. Despite the global regulatory framework around virtual currencies gaining prominence, there are fundamental weaknesses that the watchdog finds uneasy, namely ‘source of funds’. With cryptos, the possibilities to circulate funds from lands few and far between is as easy buying milk, and banks, exchanges and the wider market must act swiftly. The CFD Trading & Compliance Forum welcomes the guidance note and expects regulators to take more stringent & drastic actions by way of legislation to ensure that preventative measures are applied pre-the-use of these innovative financial instruments. And banks, that have questionable or suspicious transactions should carry out the appropriate checks as earliest as possible to maintain confidence and reduce the possibility of financial crime and inefficient activities distorting the marketplace.”\nDo you agree with Shapeshift’s appraisals of the current regulatory climate in United States?

    "text": "\n A directive affecting the crypto sector in Europe has been adopted by the EU Council. The document updates the anti-money laundering legislation of the European Union to address, among other issues, “the risks linked to virtual currencies.” The new rules aim to reduce anonymity for both users and transactions with requirements for know-your-customer procedures that crypto platforms will have to implement. Meanwhile, a high-ranking ECB official has called for segregating the crypto business from traditional finances. \nAlso read: Europe Introduces Customer Verification on Cryptocurrency Exchanges\nAuthorities to Monitor the Use of Cryptocurrencies\n“Strengthening EU rules to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing” has been declared as the main purpose for the changes adopted as part of an “action plan” launched after the terrorist attacks in Europe in 2016. The new directive sets out to “close down criminal finance without hindering the normal functioning of the payment systems,” according to the Council’s press service. The amendments to EU Directive 2015/849 of the European Parliament and the Council of May 20, 2015, were adopted at a meeting of the General Affairs Council on Monday, without discussion. The move follows an agreement with the European Parliament form December 2017. In April this year, MEPs voted to support the deal to “bring cryptocurrencies under closer regulation.”\nThe main changes involve addressing the “risks linked to virtual currencies” by taking steps to reduce anonymity for both crypto traders and crypto-related transactions. According to the texts, providers of exchange services between virtual and fiat currencies, as well as custodian wallet providers, will be obliged to identify suspicious activities. The directive states that authorities should be able to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies through these platforms, and the national financial intelligence units should have access to information allowing them to associate crypto addresses with the identities of their owners.\n\nThe authors acknowledge that the measures in the document do not entirely address the issue of anonymity. These measures should be detailed by member-states which will have 18 months to transpose the provisions of the directive into their national regulatory frameworks. Once that happens, crypto exchanges across the Union will be obliged to comply with stricter anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) guidelines, including by introducing full customer verification on their platforms.\nSome companies have already taken steps in that direction. Localbitcoins, the popular Helsinki-based peer-to-peer exchange, has recently updated its Terms of Service. It admitted that the changes had been introduced mainly due to EU regulations. They highlight identification requirements and warn users that in some situations, such as trading over certain volume limits, or in cases of account hacking/recovery and fraud investigations, they will be required to submit identification documents. The new terms will be enforced as early as this month.\nVirtual Currencies Defined\nThe EU Council states that “virtual currencies should not to be confused with electronic money.” Its directive points out that although cryptos can be used as a means of payment, they could also serve other purposes and find broader applications such as means of exchange, investment, and store-of-value.\nA definition of “virtual currencies” has been provided, in which they have been referred to as “digital representation of value that is not issued or guaranteed by a central bank or a public authority.” The directive also notes that cryptocurrencies are not attached to a legally established currency and do not have the legal status of fiat money, but are accepted by natural or legal persons as a means of exchange. Cryptocurrencies can be transferred, stored and traded electronically, the text reads.\nThe European institution has identified custodian wallet providers as “entities safeguarding private cryptographic keys on behalf of their customers in order to hold, store and transfer virtual currencies.” According to the legal document, national authorities should ensure that they, along with the providers of crypto exchange services, are registered or licensed.\nThe directive also introduces changes regarding anonymous prepaid bank cards to “deny terrorists this means of financing.” The threshold for mandatory identification of their holders has been lowered to EUR 150. Identity verification will also be required in cases of remote payment transactions exceeding EUR 50.\nECB Official Wants to “Ring-Fence” Crypto Business\nWhile Brussels is moving to strengthen rules governing crypto transactions, Frankfurt is suggesting that the entire crypto business should be segregated from traditional finances. According to a report by Reuters, a high-ranking representative of the European Central Bank has stated that banks should separate any activities related to virtual currencies (VCs) from their other operations and even back them with capital to reduce the risk. The official also called for regulating issuers of cryptos and tokens, exchanges, and any bank or clearing house dealing in them.\n“Due to the high volatility of virtual currencies, it might seem appropriate to require any VC trading to be backed by adequate levels of capital and segregated from other trading and investment activities,” Yves Mersch, member of the ECB board, said at a conference in Turkey this Monday. He added that the crypto market was too small to endanger financial stability but cautioned this could change. Mersch emphasized that “There’s a need to examine whether any VC activity carried out by financial market infrastructures should have to be ring-fenced.”\nWhat do you think about the new rules that will soon govern crypto interactions in the EU?

    "text": "\n On May 15, 2018, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network upgraded the chain’s base block size from 8MB to 32MB. The software advancement makes blocks big enough to process lots of transactions over time — which gives developers plenty of breathing room to adjust the size if it starts getting closer to its limit. Unfortunately, many misdirected individuals assume the BCH chain will start processing 32MB blocks right away, which could lead to a blockchain that’s much larger in gigabyte size and takes longer to download. However, this is not the case right now at all, because BCH miners process blocks that are often still under 1MB, as the 32MB code is only set to ensure the network is capable in the future.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features\nThe Successful 32MB Block Size Increase Paves a Path for Mass Adoption \nAfter the Bitcoin Cash network upgraded yesterday and even before the fork, a few misguided individuals asked why there was a need to raise the block size fourfold when 8MB blocks were not filling just yet. The reason developers raised the limit to 32MB is likely because the software is perfectly capable of handling such a task in the future. Right now block size limits are set by the miner, and developers are there to help set the capacity so blocks cannot get full in the immediate future, and fees will remain low for quite some time. Unfortunately for the Bitcoin Core (BTC) network, Core developers let the block size fill beyond capacity, and fees became unreliable during the last quarter of 2017. The 32MB BCH block size adjustment ensures this will not happen to the BCH network down the road, even when transaction usage becomes as extreme as 2017’s last quarter.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community and developers are not afraid of forks and protocol upgrades. The May 15th upgrade is the second successful hard fork on the BCH network.\nLooking at BCH blocks on Coin Dance — a website which records BCH chain data currently shows that mining limits are being set by the mining pool. Over the past nine months, there have been a few 2,4, and 8MB blocks processed, but typically blocks have been a megabyte or less. So in essence, once miners decide its necessary to increase the block sizes they process, they will do so based on transactions and adoption increasing over time. In fact, current data also shows the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain is still 34.4GB larger than the Bitcoin Cash chain.\nAfter the block size increase miners are not processing 32MB blocks, the upgrade was meant to ensure they can handle that capacity in the future. \n Transaction Data Shows Daily BCH Transactions Has Increased by 186% in Nine Months  \nAt the moment Bitcoin Cash transactions per day are less than BTC as there are roughly 20-25,000 daily BCH transactions. But there’s also been a misdirected notion that the BCH chain isn’t getting much use, but this is simply untrue as data shows over the past nine months that BCH daily transaction percentage rates have increased. The decentralized currency BCH has seen a steady incline (186%) of use since the August 1 fork and the expansion of BCH transactions are now only 5-10,000 transactions less per day than the Litecoin (LTC) network — a cryptocurrency that has been around for 7 years. This is due in part to many Bitcoin Cash-based on-chain platforms like the tipping bot Tippr, the social media apps Memo and Blockpress, and other applications that help increase BCH usage.\nIn just nine months Bitcoin Cash has more than doubled its transaction count, and the BCH daily transaction rate is just below LTC’s daily transactions per day. \n32X the Capacity is Merely Preparation for the Future of Bitcoin Cash Adoption \nEssentially the bottom line is the software is now capable of processing 32MB blocks as it was previously capable of 8MB blocks. So far BCH miners had proven the capability of mining much larger blocks than 1MB multiple times, clearing thousands of transactions from the mempool. After the successful fork on May 15, some BCH supporters are already asking developers to remove the block size limit entirely.\nThe hilarious TX Highway has updated to 32 lanes. \nMoreover, we know from testing that the Bitcoin software is capable of processing gigabyte blocks, and research studies further suggest the network could handle terabyte blocks as well. Unlike other digital asset developers, BCH programmers have set the bar high for capacity based on the known advancements in scaling a cryptocurrency network. Instead of saying “we don’t need to scale now,” the 32MB increase establishes a base block size that can efficiently handle 32X more transactions than the BTC network’s highest daily transaction rate recorded this past December.\nWhat do you think about the 32MB block size upgrade?

    "text": "\n There’s a constant feud these days between Bitcoin Core (BTC) supporters and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) proponents right down to the nitty-gritty of nearly every topic in the space, and the arguments continue to this day, relentlessly. One such example is the Bitcoin Cash article hosted on Wiki has been page protected for a couple weeks now for “vandalism.”\nAlso Read: Hong Kong Alcohol Company Buys 51% of Bitcoin Miner for $60 Million\nBitcoin Cash Wiki Article Gets Locked Down Due to Constant Vandalism \nThe Wikipedia website is a collaborative effort that allows anyone to edit and contribute additions to Wiki articles for the sake of documenting history online. So often times subjects are edited by anyone online but, if the subject is contentious, an ‘editing war’ can erupt. This means editors argue about the neutrality of the article and Wiki’s dispute resolution services come into play. Right now this is taking place at the Bitcoin Cash article found on Wiki and the page displays a warning about the contention. \n“The neutrality of this article is disputed — Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page — Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met,” explains Wiki when you visit the page. Further investigation directs readers and editors to the talk section which states:\n\nThere have been attempts to recruit editors of specific viewpoints to this article. If you’ve come here in response to such recruitment, please review the relevant Wikipedia policy on recruitment of editors, as well as the neutral point of view policy. Disputes on Wikipedia are resolved by consensus, not by majority vote.\n\n\nMost of the Edit Wars Are ‘Bcash’ Related\nGoing down the rabbit hole further points to an ugly situation where editors are battling about neutrality, and members of the general public are ‘vandalizing’ the page. For instance looking at the discussion on the editor’s ‘talk page’ and the Bitcoin Cash article’s revisions page many of the arguments and edits revolve around calling the cryptocurrency ‘Bcash.’ \n\nOn April 20th a Wikipedia editor named ‘Foxyjim’ tried to change the name to ‘Bcash’ and argued the name was acceptable for the BCH-focused article and Wikipedia standards. ‘Bcash’ considered a derogatory term by a great majority of the BCH community, and many believe the term is used as an attempt to confuse people. On one occasion an editor and another contributor named ‘Toomuchtalk’ reverted an edit that was attempted by the user Foxyjim.   \n“Foxyjim obviously doesn’t understand what Wikipedia is — Just because a disagreeing faction created a derogatory name in an effort to obscure the truthful Bitcoin history and are upset that they are using the name Bitcoin does not make the use of Bcash a legitimate historical fact,” the editor explains.  \n\nIn no way would a supporter of Bitcoin Cash supporter be ok with this!   \n\nThe New Cypherpunks \nThe ‘Bcash edit is a common attack made regularly on the article and disputed in Wiki edit warring discussions. Other issues with the page stem from reliable sources, arguments on how the fork was initiated, and debates regarding the Segregated Witness protocol. Throughout the revisions page, there are multiple debated edits every single day. Moreover, the neutrality template on the Bitcoin Cash article has been added and removed a few times over the past few months as well. Last week the lead developer of the BCH client Bitcoin ABC, Amaury Séchet, noticed the neutrality template on the article and made a remark about it to his followers on Twitter, stating:        \n\nBitcoin Cash Wikipedia is now protected due to repeated vandalism — ‘Cypherpunks do Orwellian shit’ is the new ‘Cypherpunk Write Code.’\n\nWhat do you think about the Bitcoin Cash Wikipedia being vandalized and suffering from edit warring?

    "text": "\n Over the past few weeks, the bitcoin cash (BCH) community has been discussing the use of ‘op-codes’ with the BCH chain. The technology could allow the creation of different types of metadata implementations like colored coins and representative tokens, alongside the ability to perform smart contracts, but in a more simplified manner as opposed to ethereum’s solidity programming language. The subject of re-activating certain op-codes and scripting abilities has invoked some excitement from BCH proponents and this May after the bitcoin cash hard fork the community will see some new op-code features.\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency Is the Main Income for 12% of Russian Crypto Users\nBringing Op-codes, Colored Coins, and Smart Contract Functionality to the Bitcoin Cash Network \nBitcoin cash is forking on Tuesday, May 15 at approximately 12:00:00 UTC, 2018 and will feature a 32 MB block size upgrade, and “several bitcoin script operation codes (op-codes) being added or reactivated.” Op-codes are basically an abbreviation for ‘operation codes’ which is essentially a portion of machine language instructions that enable the performance of a specific task. The Bitcoin Cash codebase uses a scripting system in transactions using a Forth-like process, and the protocol has the ability to create colored coins, and simplified smart contracts that can perform automated functions.        \nThe resurrection of op-code deployment has been discussed for quite some time, but was recently brought back up when Bitcoin Unlimited’s Andrew Stone launched the ‘Op-Group’ meetings on Github. Bitcoin cash developer participants at the meeting included Amaury Sechét of Bitcoin ABC, Dan Connolly of bitcoin.j.cash, Steve Shadders of Nchain, and other programmers. \n“In order to support non-trivial cash use cases for the bitcoin cash blockchain, a number of ecosystem participants would like to see some of the original bitcoin op-codes re-enabled for use in smart contracts,” explains the meeting summary back in February.  \n\nHowever, the original issues associated with these opcodes remain valid — Namely, undefined behavior, and potential for DDoS attacks against the network.    \n\nThe Initial Opposition to Op-Group \nAccording to the Op-Group meeting, the developers will re-instate nine op-codes that were once available in older bitcoin implementations. Some of the op-code phrases were removed because there was a fear of bugs. For instance, in an early version of the bitcoin codebase, the op-code ‘OP_LSHIFT’ allegedly could crash any bitcoin node if exploited. The reinstating of op-codes came with some controversy within the bitcoin cash community. When Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) proponents brought up the subject, there was an argument about using op-codes or the recently developed Counterparty Cash implementation. During the heated battle, BU supporters showed some angst against ABC developers at the time.      \nAmaury Séchet argued during the initial discussions, “If Counterparty breaks, only Counterparty breaks. If OP_GROUP breaks, Bitcoin Cash breaks.” The Counterparty protocol uses a separate network to complete the tokenization process rather than the BCH chain.\nCounterparty Cash will also be able to create tokenized assets using BCH but will utilize the XCPC network. Op-Group development will be different and will use the BCH chain natively. \n The Resolution Towards Scripting Abilities and a £5 Million Pound Bounty \nHowever, with all the infighting aside there seemed to be some resolution as the topic of colored coins and op-codes was a central theme of discussion during the Satoshi’s Vision Conference in Tokyo. Moreover, the Calvin Ayre owned firm, Coingeek, is willing to pay a programmer or development team £5 million if they can bring a tokenization functionality to the BCH chain. \n\nThe developers must create a generic system or suite of interactive systems that produce secure blockchain-based tokens, wallet compatibility, and an audit solution so the public can check the validity of tokens created. Further developers will be allowed to utilize Nchain’s intellectual property assets. The firm just launched its completed 1.0 version of its new ‘Nakasendo’ software development kit (SDK) for BCH developers. Coingeek states that the tokenization contest doesn’t necessarily require smart contract capability, but it can offer that specific functionality as well.    \n“The solution must be provided with supporting design documentation, as well as working code that shall include source code — The solution may (but is not required to) involve execution of a smart contract solution on the blockchain,” explains the company Coingeek.\nBitcoin cash proponents are excited to see BCH take on some cool features like creating colored coins or tokens that can represent any virtual or physical asset like stocks, bonds, precious metals, loyalty points, and more. Smart contracts could also bring the advancement of basic types of automated processes like leaving funds for someone to receive at a later date, or more complicated ideas like decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).    \nWhat do you think about op-codes being re-instated and added to the bitcoin cash protocol?

    "text": "\n A conference dedicated to raising awareness among women about cryptocurrencies is scheduled to take place in the Russian capital this month. The speakers at the event, also women, will share practical information on cryptos, blockchain technologies, and investment opportunities. The event will be live-streamed in 74 countries. \nAlso read: Cryptocurrency Is the Main Income for 12% of Russian Crypto Users\nWomen Advising Women\nThe “Crypto Conference for Women” will be held on April 28-29, at the Zolotoe Koltso hotel in Moscow, where experts and entrepreneurs will tell participants what cryptocurrency is and how it works. 24 female speakers will share advice on how to start with an initial investment and recommendations on storage options. The latest developments in the crypto world will be presented to the audience, along with other useful information.\n\nAn advanced course has been prepared for attendants with prior experience in blockchain technologies, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), or other crypto-related projects. Its program is tailored to increase their knowledge to a more professional level. Anastasia Pilipchuk, founder of the Crypto Lady Association and organizer of the event, told Bitnovosti:\n\nWomen can earn through cryptocurrencies much easier than it looks at first sight. Cryptocurrency is simply made for women.\n\nThe guest lecturers intend to discuss the crypto perspectives in Russia for the next two years. They will be largely determined by the legislation currently under review in Russia’s parliament. Two draft laws have been introduced in the State Duma. One of the bills, “On Digital Financial Assets”, is expected to legalize ICOs and cryptocurrency mining in the country. The second one is supposed to regulate the use of cryptocurrencies in payments, and also amend the civil code to protect investors’ interests and rights.\nOnly 7% of Russian Crypto Users are Women\nIn Russia, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have enjoyed increasing popularity over recent months and years. According to the Russian Association of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain (RACIB), ICOs with Russian participation account for 10% of the global market. Token sales conducted by Russian projects have attracted $310 million dollars in 2017, according to a report released in January.\nMore and more Russians use cryptocurrencies and according to a new survey, 12% of them admit that cryptos are their main source of income. The study, however, also indicated that Russian women are not equally involved in the crypto economy – only 7% of the respondents who use cryptocurrencies are women. Even the group of the underage users is bigger – 10%.\nThe leading Russian female experts hope to change the status-quo with their participation in the crypto conference. Among them are Elina Sidorenko, head of the Duma’s interdepartmental working group tasked with assessing cryptocurrencies, and Nadejda Surova, member of the parliamentary expert council on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.\nMore than 20 other representatives of the crypto sector and entrepreneurs have been invited to share their experience. The conference will be live-streamed in 74 countries around the world, the organizers said. Everyone is welcome to join the event, even men.\nDo you believe that initiatives like the conference in Moscow can bring more women into the crypto world?

    "text": "\n As cryptocurrency investing is becoming more mainstream, it keeps attracting wealthier and more cautious established players. To answer the need for enhanced security by such investors, one of the biggest names in the gold business, Goldmoney, has now expanded its bitcoin cold storage service to include ethereum and bitcoin cash.\nAlso Read: Las Vegas Strippers Accept Bitcoin via QR Tattoos\nGoldmoney Expands Cold Storage\nGoldmoney, a precious metal investment service and payment network traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX:XAU), is expanding its bitcoin (BTC) cold storage to include two more cryptocurrencies. The company has announced that ethereum (ETH) is now available to all its ‘Full Verified Goldmoney Holding Owners’ as a fully-reserved offline investable asset, with bitcoin cash (BCH) to follow in the coming weeks.\nClients can now directly purchase auditable and AML-compliant (Anti-Money Laundering) ethereum and sell their holdings back to Goldmoney in the same way they trade precious metals. The company explains that “securely stored in ‘cold storage’, client cryptocurrency holdings are password protected and shielded from being used in hot wallets or third-party transfers.”\nFrom Gold to Crypto\nAccording to its public records, Goldmoney is safeguarding nearly $2 billion in assets for clients located in more than 150 countries and brings in $524 million in yearly revenues. Back in December 2017 it was revealed that the gold specialist is now involved more in the cryptocurrency business than the precious metal trade that gives it its name.\nThe company’s founder, Roy Sebag, commented at the time that: “While it’s personally intellectually displeasing, it is becoming clear that since Goldmoney launched crypto (with only bitcoin), our net bitcoin sales per day have grown to become bigger than precious metals. We are seeing nearly half a mill $ a day of net crypto accumulation.”\nSupport for BCH cold storage, following BTC and ETH, is a predictable step as the cryptocurrency has been becoming ever more widely available recently. For example, the American ATM network Athena Bitcoin earlier this month added support for buying and selling bitcoin cash for USD on all its machines in dozens of physical locations across the US and Mexico.\nAre wealthy gold bugs a natural audience for ethereum and bitcoin cash adoption?

    "text": "\n Multiple concerned U.S. corporate customers of Bitfinex have posted on Reddit after discovering that they were unable to access the exchange’s margin trading services. Although Bitfinex has previously indicated that it would no longer allow U.S individuals to access the exchange’s services, Bitfinex’s support portal currently states that the restrictions do not affect U.S. corporate customers.\nAlso Read: U.S. Regulators Send Tether and Bitfinex Subpoenas\nBitfinex Restricts U.S. Corporate Account Holders From Accessing Margin Markets\nIn recent days, several Redditors claiming to be U.S.-based corporate customers of Bitfinex have complained that they have suddenly found themselves unable to access the exchange’s margin services.\nLast year, Bitfinex announced that it would terminate its services to U.S. retail customers in November. However, the company assured corporate customers that “the restriction affects individuals accounts only” – as currently stated by the FAQ section of Bitfinex’s support portal.\nMargin Traders Left Unable to Close Positions\nOne Redditor posted “We’ve had a corporate account with Bitfinex since early 2017 and [are] approved for both exchange, margin, and funding. […] We’ve been making 6-figure trades on margin and currently have 2 margin positions open. On Feb 7th, […] we were locked out of margin trading. No explanation or warning of why our account can’t trade on margin. Worst yet, we can’t manage our margin positions. Not good in this very volatile market. We’ve received a couple of liquidation warning emails as the market dived down yesterday. We sent a support ticket […] and probably over 7 emails. No response from Bitfinex. It appears that they haven’t even opened any of the emails.”\nLater that day, a Bitfinex representative called “bill_bfx” contacted the Redditor, stating that the issue had been “forwarded to the team to resolve for you.” Bill_bfx stated that “a US corporate customer […] should not be using margin trading,” however, noted that “if you have open positions it is not acceptable to block you from closing them.”\nThe Redditor acknowledged the response and stated he would update the thread if his issue was resolved. As of this writing, no indication has been made that the situation has been resolved, despite bill_bfx responding to the Redditor four days ago.\nCorporate Customers Seemingly Caught Unaware\nAnother Redditor posted “I’ve been lending on Bitfinex for a while. Earlier today, the API responded that US users are no longer allowed to take or lend any currency denomination […] I understand that US retail customers cannot use it but I believe the policy did not apply to corporate customers. Has there been a recent change in policy? Will it be permanent or is this a temporary measure?”\nAs of this writing, the second Redditor has not received a response from Bitfinex, despite directly questioning bill_bfx about the matter on a different thread. Though Bill_bfx did not respond to the Redditor’s query, however, a day later, Bill_bfx did find time to post a sarcastic response to a trollish comment on the same thread.\nDo you think that more exchanges will move to restrict access from U.S. customers?

Ver is thrilled the proceeds will go Antiwar.com which focuses on lessening centralized governments, ending the world’s wars, and spreading peace throughout the globe. After hearing the news about the Charitystar’s auction Roger Ver commented: \n\nAs the blockchain community continues to grow it is important that we don’t lose sight of the most serious issues affecting the world today — Having long believed that bitcoin has the power to halt conflict and war, I am honored to leverage my experience and expertise in the industry for a cause dedicated to this.\n\nThe power lunch with Roger Ver will take place in Saint Kitts a beautiful Caribbean island located near the West Indies. The meeting is expected to take place within the next six months depending on the winner and Ver’s availability.

The commissioner has emphasized the protection of investors being the principal mandate of the SEC, stating “We want to come up with our own set of regulations. You have to be extra careful how investors in this new space are protected.”\nAlthough the commissioner conceded that the legislation is currently in the “drafting stage,” he expressed his expectation that the regulatory framework will be developed “within the year.”\nICOs Must Register With Philippine SEC\nThe Philippines’ SEC will permit companies to conduct ICOs, provided that they comply with the regulator’s disclosure and registration requirements.\nMr. Aquino stated “The mindset of the commission has always been to foster innovation, but they need to register,” adding “Unfortunately, there have been a lot of cases where ICO promoters vanish into thin air. We don’t want that to happen here […] We need to act because initial coin offerings are sprouting.”\nThe announcement comes several weeks after the Philippines’ SEC filed a cease-and-desist order against four companies associated with the Krops ICO for violating securities laws. Mr. Aquino indicated that the SEC may choose to lift the order against Krops.\nPhilippine Regulator to Keep “Open Mind” Regarding Cryptocurrencies\nCommissioner Aquino stated that The Philippines has sought to keep “an open mind” regarding cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technology (DLT), alluding to the potential reduction in fees that virtual currency adoption could offer the approximately 10 million Philippine workers living abroad who are estimated to remit nearly $25 billion USD home each year.\nLast year, The Philippines’ central bank, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), developed legislation governing the operation of virtual currency exchanges. Two applicants have received approval so far, with the deputy director and head of the BSP’s core information technology specialist group indicating in December 2017 that the central bank was then reviewing 12 applications from prospective virtual currency exchanges.\nWhat do you make of the Philippine SEC’s statements regarding its forthcoming cryptocurrency regulations?

The solar energy technology company is accused of misleading investors by making a false report. The matter at hand is how its share price jumped by 150% on December 18 after Apollo announced it entered the cryptocurrency mining business.\nAlso Read: First Real Bitcoin Lightning Network Payment Completed via Bitrefill\nClass Action Lawsuit\nApollo Power, its chairman, CEO and directors are accused of gravely misleading investors by making an immediate report to the TASE which had crucial missing details. According to the application for a class action lawsuit, the accused “identified an attractive trend called blockchain.”\nSo, at the morning of the 18th, the company made a dramatic breaking announcement regarding an experiment in mining cryptocurrencies with its system. Investors were led to believe this was a breakthrough that will save significant electricity costs for miners, making the system more valuable.\nWith bitcoin at over $19,000 and ether close to $800 that day, the stock price of Apollo shot up in price from 4.3 shekels to over 10 shekels immediately after this first report, as many investors regarded the announcement as credible and bought the stock. However, just six hours later Apollo made a second report which made it clear, according to class action application, that the first announcement was, “partial, false, misleading, fake, fraudulent and at the very least negligent.”\nBitcoin Verbal Gymnastics\nApollo was forced by the Israel Securities Authority to issue its second announcement on the December 18, which revealed its earlier report was missing many crucial details. According to its accusers, the company used artistic verbal gymnastics to jam in the word bitcoin into the report “in order to motivate investors to buy the stock.” The ISA is already separately investigating the matter on its own, as we reported last week.\nThe second announcement revealed that the half hour experiment produced just 0.000054 ETH worth about 4 cents at the time. Furthermore it was made clear that the system can only mine about 35 cents worth of altcoins a day, and no bitcoin at all. There are also yet unestimated extra costs for mining with the system, while the original announcement said that the breakthrough can create a substantial additional income source for users. The class action lawsuit application thus accuses the company of causing great financial losses to the group of investors who bought it after the first report.\nShould stock investors trust any firm that starts claiming to have some connection to bitcoin or it is all just pure hype?

The more than three hundred year old bank set up a research unit back in 2015 to investigate linking a state-backed crypto to sterling, and there appears to be a breakthrough. \nAlso read: EU Central Banker: No Plans to Issue State-Backed Cryptocurrency\n\nBank of England Might Go Crypto in 2018\nVenezuela has its Petro. Russia is looking at a Cryptoruble. Could there be a Britcoin? A Ukoin?  The Telegraph would have readers believe, yes, writes its Chief Reporter Robert Mendick. Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, reportedly “told a Treasury Select Committee before Christmas that he had held talks with other central banks about launching digital currency,” according to Mr. Mendick.\nMark Carney\nGovernor Carney, 52, is the first non-Briton to hold that position at the Bank of England. Former Governor of the Bank of Canada, he also spent over a decade at Goldman Sachs. Just days ago, Mr. Carney confirmed bitcoin is an “active area of interest” and seemed most interested in its underlying mechanism for delivery, the decentralized distributed ledger. Unconcerned about its retail potential, he told British lawmakers, “You don’t end up with those financial stability risks, you get financial stability benefits. And you save huge amounts of computational energy intensity.”\nHe went on to describe the Bank of England’s study of bitcoin as “pretty active in it but we’re also disciplined. If we’re going to apply something to the core of the system, it’s going to need to meet five sigma quality rating.”\nWorking with It\nDr. George Danezis\nPerhaps foreshadowing The Telegraph scoop, he ended his remarks, “What I say on this topic today will be outdated six months from now because things are moving so rapidly.” Indeed, the English paper began its coverage of the topic with the opening, “The Bank of England could green light its own Bitcoin-style digital currency as early as 2018, The Telegraph can disclose.” \nWith meetings continuing at the beginning of the next year, he confirmed “I have participated in discussions with the major central banks on this issue” of a central bank-backed digital currency. And over the summer the Bank of England used blockchain technology as a test to see if it could be used as settlements between central banks. It was successful. “The underlying technology is actually of a fair bit of interest. We are working with it at the Bank of England,” he reportedly explained to the Treasury Select Committee. \nIn the Spring of last year, the Bank of England commissioned Dr. George Danezis of the University College London to devise a cryptocurrency with state-assumed backing. RS Coin was born, and it did seem to add efficiencies associated with automation as it relates to banking purposes: central banks could easily control the money supply at any given time, and could obviously determine the amount of money in circulation.\nThough Mr. Carney probably believes the potential Bank of England digital token would be used only between central banks, The Telegraph reports a “research unit set up by the Bank is investigating the possible introduction of a cryptocurrency linked to sterling.” It’s hard to imagine traditional retail banks allowing this to happen, as it would surely be their death. A world of frictionless, snap-of-the-fingers transacting for houses, cars, etc. is not something legacy banking could survive.\nDo you think the BoE will actually issue its own cryptocurrency this year?

A new venture, Pineapple Fund, is showing the luckiest members of the bitcoin community how can this be done best. \nAlso Read: Paxful to Help Fund 100 Schools in Africa #BuiltWithBitcoin\nPineapple Seeds\nPine, the anonymous bitcoin whale behind the $86 million Pineapple Fund, has announced a $5 million donation to the organization Give Directly, for its “seed capital for the poor” project. The donation will help sponsor direct cash transfers to people living in extreme poverty conditions in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda.\nThe charity, supported by Google and others, is known for its rigorous analytical approach to finding the most impactful ways for distributing donations. It boasts a 91% efficiency rate, a high benchmark in a field full of organizations that waste much more on administration and fundraising costs.\nOnly revealed to the public earlier this month, the Pineapple Fund has already donated to six previous charities. These include Watsi ($1Mn), The Water Project ($1Mn), the Electronic Frontier Foundation ($1Mn), the Bitgive Foundation ($500K), MAPS psychedelic studies ($1Mn), and the Open BSD Foundation ($500K).\nUniversal Basic Income\nBeyond helping the specific families that will be supported by the cash transfers, the project is also used to test the efficacy of universal basic income (UBI). Unlike social welfare and many traditional charity schemes, one of the central tenets of UBI is that it is not tied to specific requirements and demands from the recipients. This is meant to prevent people from falling into a poverty trap where they can’t try to improve their financial conditions without losing their support.\nUBI was one of the hottest economic topics of 2017, mostly talked about as a possible solution to technological unemployment – keeping people from falling behind once robots take over all the jobs we have today. By working in countries such as Kenya, where the average Give Directly recipient lives on just 65 cents per day, the organization is able to test the UBI concept with modest costs before it’s implemented in more expensive regions of the world.\nWhat other good causes should the bitcoin community should get behind?

Meanwhile, the fully minable option for all bitcoin mining contracts will be available soon, the company promised.\nFounded in 2013, Genesis Mining is one of the largest cloud-based cryptocurrency mining ventures globally. It provides hashing power to many miners from all over the world, focusing on bitcoin, dash, ethereum, litecoin, zcash and monero (which is the only contract in stock at the moment). Now miners can automatically trade their proceeds for bitcoin cash and thus hedge against it taking off without them.\n\nMusic Records, Gift Cards and Plastic Surgery\nOnce miners get their hands on some bitcoin cash they can use it for more than just trading, like paying for music records, gift cards and even plastic surgery.\nMusic records store Eruce announced a few days ago that it has switched to BCH as its official currency for album order payment. The company used to accept BTC payment but now they explain that: “in the last 2 months, our customers found out it would be very difficult to get their payments confirmed. Usually, our albums cost from $1 to few bucks. With current status of Bitcoin Core, its impossible for us to continue our journey with them.”\nAnd, if you are in need of some breast augmentations, tummy tucks or other forms of cosmetic surgery, just head down to Florida. Dr. Danny Soares, a plastic surgeon and Director of a medical center in the Sunshine State, has recently made public his decision to accept BCH as a method of payment for elective surgical procedures. The good doctor has even called on his fellow nip tuck artists to do the same.\n\nFinally, if you are looking to buy some gift cards for Amazon, Steam, iTunes, Starbucks or many other popular services, someone has launched a new website called Cryptonize.it just for you. It exclusively accepts bitcoin cash, offering merchants a platform to sell their products to the bitcoin cash community while avoiding volatility risks. It has only been up for a few weeks so the site is not very polished yet, has daily spending limits and other growing pains, but will be interesting to see how it develops.\nAre you looking to get a face lift or the latest Ariana Grande album with your bitcoin cash?

    "text": "\n There’s been a lot of hype surrounding purchasing real-estate with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. However, even though bitcoin has spiked considerably in value using the asset for purchasing properties and homes is not so easy.\nAlso read: Dancing With the Devil: ‘Cashing Out’ Cryptos Into Fiat Not So Easy\nBitcoin Real Estate Purchases Come With Difficulties\nLately, there’s been a considerable amount of attention given to cryptocurrency entering the real-estate industry and homes for sale priced in bitcoin. Earlier this year Sotheby’s International Realty sold a luxury Austin, Texas home for bitcoins, and in Miami, a 950-square foot condo is selling for roughly 60 BTC. There are also more extravagant sales out there in the real estate market as well as bitcoiners can now purchase an abandoned prison facility for around 88 bitcoins. Although, according to the publication Mansion Global, many real estate agents and attorneys have revealed that offering to purchase a home with bitcoin may come with some issues.\nFor instance, most BTC to real estate purchases are treated like an “all-cash” buy, and users usually transact between wallets or a payment facilitator like Bitpay. Due to the type of transaction, both parties will need a lawyer for the closing of the deal and it’s likely they will only accept fiat. In addition to having lawyers present, the two parties also have to utilize an underwriter and an insurance company as well. Moreover, some real estate deals have been made but fell by the wayside due to bitcoin’s price fluctuations.\nSome cryptocurrency real-estate transactions have been completed like this Austin, Texas home purchased using bitcoins. \nThe Complexity of Lawyers, Titles, Underwriters, and Potential Tax Implications When Purchasing Real Estate With Cryptocurrency \nThe San Francisco-based Redfin real-estate agent, Carina Isentaeva, explains to the publication that not all cryptocurrency home purchasing attempts close their deals. Isentaeva dealt with a home sale in Silicon Valley that fell through because the buyer couldn’t sell his bitcoins by the time of the closing day. There are also tax implications involved in many different countries, as the U.S. requires 20 percent capital gains and more for the net cryptocurrency investment appreciation. Some potential buyers have had troubles with people who have had second thoughts about accepting bitcoin as well.\nSome Bitcoiners Are Opting for Collateralized Loans\nStartups offering loans for cryptocurrency collateral are starting to become a popular business model. \nBitcoiners with enough funds to purchase a home must then find a brokerage service or merchant processor to convert their cryptocurrency back to fiat reserves. Another option for cryptocurrency buyers is securing a collateralized loan with their bitcoins, but there’s not that many companies or financial institutions offering this type of service. Collateralized cryptocurrency loan companies are far and few between but there are a few startups like Salt Lending and Unchained. The firm Unchained Capital based in Austin Texas is a company that’s been offering loans that are backed by the buyer’s crypto assets.     \n“Unchained allows bitcoin owners to borrow up to $1 million with interest rates between 10% and 14% — The company has gone all the way up to $5 million in rare instances,” explains Joseph Kelly, the co-founder, and CEO.\nThe Unchained executive explains the company has also finalized longer-term contracts and has seen quite a few customers use the loan service for real-estate purchases. “We see a lot of people getting cash for a downpayment,” Mr. Kelly noted.\nWhat do you think about the challenges presented when trying to purchase or sell real estate using cryptocurrencies?

    "text": "\n While major stock brokers are lining up to add bitcoin futures to their platforms, central bankers are apparently not too happy about it. A member of the European Central Bank (ECB) executive board has called the instruments a threat to the financial stability of the entire banking system. \nAlso Read: After Ripple’s Rise BTC Dominance Falls Below 40%\nMajor Threat to Financial Stability\nIn an interview with German financial daily Börsen-Zeitung, ECB director Yves Mersch sounded the alarm on financial institutions investing in bitcoin futures like those offered by the Cboe and CME. “There are now banks which hold positions in bitcoin. It is a matter for the supervisors to judge how big the risks are, he said. “What concerns me most, is when financial market infrastructures such as stock exchanges enter this business. That poses a major threat to financial stability.”\nRegarding the systematic risks and his position on the central bank’s involvement, he explained: “If these transactions are kept separate from others, it’s a secondary matter who wins and who loses. However, if all the participants in these financial centers are jointly liable, that can create difficulties, for instance, for banks or the whole system. And if the banking system gets into trouble, there will again be demands for support from the ECB. I would say from the outset: we shouldn’t do this.”\nMoney Needs Trust, Blockchain is the Real Threat\nThe ECB director, who proposed just a month ago that commercial banks create digital cash to compete with the growing popularity of bitcoin, now claims that the cryptocurrency can’t become a real alternative to central bank money. “Money needs trust. Public currencies, for example the euro, have the backing of public institutions such as the ECB. Many of these currencies have no backing, nothing.”\nAs is common for bankers and bureaucrats to do today, he hyped ‘blockchain technology’ instead. “That’s a challenge we all have to face, especially banks. Each institution has to know that in the future financial intermediation will no longer be heaven-sent, but has to be fought for.”\nBitcoin trading itself is not at present an issue for monetary policy because “turnover is between €250 and €350 billion. The volume is therefore comparatively low.” Regarding the cryptocurrency’s massive 2017 price rally he added: “We are seeing speculative hype that might be a cause for concern. But of course individual investors are free to gamble. However, if something goes wrong, they should not come to us and say we should have outlawed it and protected them from themselves.”\nVAT on Bitcoin Cult?\nBitcoin doesn’t appear to have many fans at the ECB beyond just Yves Mersch. At least two officials spoke out against the cryptocurrency and its users today on European media.\nEwald Nowotny, ECB governing council member and head of Austria’s central bank, called for new taxes and regulation on bitcoin in an interview with the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. He said: “We need a value-added tax on bitcoin, since it’s not a currency. It can’t be allowed that we’ve just decided to stop printing 500-euro notes to fight money laundering, that we’ve slapped strict rules on every tiny savings club, and then have to watch people blithely laundering money around the globe with bitcoin. One ought to apply what the basic rule is in any other financial transaction: everyone involved should reveal their identity.”\nEstonia central bank governor and ECB Governing Council member, Ardo Hansson, told the Estonian news paper Eesti Paevaleht that rationality has disappeared from the cryptocurrency sector. He thus concluded that the “cryptocurrency bubble is like a religious sect,” driven by emotions which will burst sooner or later.\nWhat are the chances that the ECB will make a major move against bitcoin in 2018?

    "text": "\n The Ho Chi Minh City Customs Department has revealed the number of known mining rigs imported into Vietnam in 2017. Over 7,000 rigs were brought into the country, mostly from China, with over 5,000 entering since November. While Vietnam is clamping down on the use of bitcoin as a means of payment, mining rigs are not on the list of prohibited items.\nAlso read: Russian Cryptocurrency Bill Is Ready – Regulators Share Details\n7,000+ Mining Rigs Imported\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Customs Department has revealed that 7,005 bitcoin mining rigs cleared customs from the beginning of 2017 to the middle of December, local publications reported.\nPreviously, the department announced that it received 98 import declarations for 1,478 mining rigs from January 1 to October 31, valued over $2,182 million, Dan Tri reported.\nThen, from the beginning of November to December 21, 2017, the number of mining rigs imported into Vietnam jumped by another 5,527, making the total number of rigs imported 7,005 in total. The 5,527 machines were mostly brought in from China through 8 organizations and individuals, the news outlet noted.\nMining Rigs Not Prohibited\nState Bank of Vietnam.\nThe General Department of Vietnam Customs previously requested the State Bank of Vietnam, the Ministry of Information and Communication, and Ministry of Industry and Trade to comment on the import of mining rigs. The central bank confirmed that mining rigs for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are “not related to the use of virtual currency as a means of payment.” As such, they are “not part of the management functions and tasks of the State Bank.”\nSubsequently, the General Department of Customs issued a notice clarifying that mining rigs are not on the list of prohibited items. Viet Times elaborated:\n\nAfter the customs announced that bitcoin mining rigs are not on the list of goods banned from import in accordance with the state regulations, the number of machines imported in the last two months of the year has soared to more than 5,000 machines.\n\nMining Rigs Could be Prohibited in the Future\nDeputy Director of the State Bank of Vietnam, Nguyen Hoang Minh, said that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are “not a legal means of payment in Vietnam. Therefore, the issuance, supply, use of bitcoin and other similar virtual currency as a means of payment is prohibited,” Vietnam Biz conveyed.\nSome businesses and individuals are concerned that the import of mining rigs will also be prohibited, the news outlet noted.\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Customs Department has already recommended General Department of Vietnam Customs “not to import these types of machinery,” according to Dan Tri. However, so far “the General Department of Customs has exchanged documents” with relevant departments concerning the import of mining rigs.\nDo you think the Vietnamese government will start prohibiting the import of mining rigs? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "text": "\n U.S. lawmakers have been ramping up their efforts to regulate bitcoin and other digital currencies. Recently, advocacy groups who focus on government transparency have been growing concerned about politicians drafting laws while not disclosing their interests in cryptocurrencies.\nAlso read: Is the Centralized Ripple Database With the Biggest Pre-Mine Really a Bitcoin Competitor?\nEthics and Government Transparency Groups Want Politicians to Fully Disclose Digital Currency Holdings \nOver the past few months, U.S. regulators and appointed lawmakers have been researching and drafting regulatory guidelines for digital assets like bitcoin. Last year the Colorado Democrat Jared Polis and Arizona Republican David Schweikert initiated the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. The caucus was created to help bureaucrats develop regulatory policies towards cryptocurrencies and their blockchain networks. Both Schweikert and Polis established the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act, while other U.S. lawmakers have been also drafting legislative rules for digital assets.\nAccording to a recent report, cryptocurrency advocacy among elected politicians concerns members of the Sunlight Foundation, a government transparency think-tank, the Office of Government Ethics, and other transparency groups.  \n“Whether a member of Congress has holdings of bitcoin is relevant to our understanding of where someone’s interests might lie,” Alex Howard the Sunlight Foundation’s deputy director explains in an interview.\nU.S. government transparency and ethics groups discuss the idea of politicians disclosing their cryptocurrency holdings. \nBitcoin and Blockchain Supporting Lawmakers Purposely Decide to Not Hold Cryptocurrencies Due to Conflict of Interest \nJust recently news.Bitcoin.com reported on the California representative Diane Feinstein drafting a bill requiring U.S. citizens to disclose their cryptocurrency assets. Moreover, during a recent judiciary hearing, Senator Feinstein explains the bill “criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control” of a digital accounts.\nStaff members from the offices of Polis and Schweikert have detailed that both members of Congress do not hold bitcoins or other digital assets. Schweikert’s congressional team member, Ashley Sylvester, explains the lawmaker “purposely” made this decision in order to avoid a conflict of interest during regulatory decision making. Louise Slaughter, who sponsored the 2012 Stock Act, a law that requires politicians to disclose assets including stocks and bonds, believes currencies like bitcoin should be included. \n“The Stock Act was written so the public could trust that members of Congress weren’t personally profiting from the office they hold,” Slaughter emphasizes.\n\nNo one should be able to get around this law, including members who invest in digital currencies.\n\nRepresentatives Polis and Schweikert detail they do not own bitcoin or other digital assets. Schweikert says he purposely decided this due to conflict of interest and Polis says he’s talking with the SEC about disclosure guidelines. \nDisclosing Foreign Currency Speculation and Proposing a Crypto-Transparency Rule \nThe Democratic representative Jared Polis said he plans to discuss a new regulatory guideline with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission that ensures politicians and staff disclose cryptocurrency holdings.  \n“Members of Congress should absolutely be required to disclose their bitcoin holdings, as to avoid any conflict of interests — The public deserves transparency,” Polis explains responding to the idea that digital currencies should be represented in laws like the 2012 Stock Act.\nThe Competitive Enterprise Institute executive Jim Harper believes if bitcoin was purely operated as a currency and not a speculative commodity as well then things might be different. “If bitcoin were just purely a currency there is an argument that you wouldn’t have to report it — With the IRS treating virtual currency as property for tax purposes, he added, “the spirit of transparency would require disclosure,” Harper details. The research group’s vice president also says that ethics committees should apply digital currencies to foreign currency speculation especially if they are members of foreign affairs groups that deal with various monetary legislation.\nDo you think politicians should disclose whether they hold bitcoin or other digital currencies if they are drafting laws tethered to the technology’s industry?

    "text": "\n The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the industry’s main regulatory arm,  reports a net increase in short contracts; volume is sluggish, and a legacy bank has now outright forbid clients and advisers from trading in the relatively new product. While it is too early in the experiment to draw definitive conclusions, bitcoin futures might not be the boost enthusiasts hoped.  \nAlso read: Jimmy Song Uses Andreas Antonopoulos Model, Open Sources Forthcoming Books\nBitcoin Futures Present is Less Than Encouraging\nCFTC end of 2017 reporting noted Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) bitcoin futures broke for short contracts, up by nearly 300 in the final week of last year. Analysts believe bubble talk consumed traders, triggering a selloff. \nA raised net short position wasn’t expected by most bulls heading into the history market. It isn’t clear what the trend means longer term, but a thirty percent spot price correction was already in the works during 2017’s final weeks which certainly didn’t help matters. Overall, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency finished the year up well-over one thousand percent.\n\nThe run-up to crypto futures was maddening in financial terms, as speculators even turned to margin in order to ride price waves – a metric many were sure was only on the way up. Such turned out to be a bad guess, and by a lot. Some analysts believe it was a necessary shaking out of more irrational investor spirits, paving the way for serious institutional firms once they realize the epoch altering technology bitcoin and its network represent. \nPeter Tchir details how Cboe open interest lagging at the end of the year has “barely risen from where it ended its first week (1,730 contracts). The CME’s contract has finished its first two weeks with open interest of only 498 contracts (the CME contract does represent 5 bitcoins so is 5 times as large as the Cboe contract),” he writes in Forbes. Underlining the feelings of a lot of bitcoin bulls, he explains “given the amount of hype surrounding bitcoin and how this product would promote new access – the numbers seem very low.  I cannot remember a futures contract that launched with more awareness than these contracts,” he lamented.\n\nBest Day = Worst Day\nVolume for contracts is also low, even considering the holidays. Bitcoin was supposed to defy those conventions anyway. And when contract volume was at its highest on December 22, 2017 – a day was later renamed Freaky Friday, Flash Friday, and FUD Friday. Prices nose-dived thousands and are still in the process are trying to recover. If this is a sign, it’s not a good one. \n\nThe loss of bitcoin market share, while at times a poor indicator of overall health (the number can be manipulated), it tells veteran analysts investors are less interested in bitcoin proper and are more apt to search for the next discounted big thing. Mr. Tchir ends his thought with what he terms “the rush to buy ‘the cheapest’ cryptocurrencies.  Who wants to buy X Bitcoins when you can buy a multiple of X of another cryptocurrency?” \n\nAgain it is still very early, but institutional investment firms are also starting to overtly and openly pull back from bitcoin. The Wall Street Journal learned Bank of America’s brokerage division, Merrill Lynch, issued an all-out ban. Neither clients nor its over fifteen thousand advisers can use its platform for bitcoin. \nThe policy, announced around the time futures were set to go live, also puts a pin in Grayscale Investment Trust’s bitcoin fund offering – a popular choice among retail investors who’d rather not bother with e-wallets and holding cryptocurrency. Other legacy banking outfits have followed suit in barring bitcoin access, including Royal Bank of Canada, UBS Group AG, Citigroup Inc, and JP Morgan Chase & Co. \nI think it’s a very good idea, a Merrill Lynch broker told the Journal.

    "text": "\n This week the founder and CEO of the trading platform BTCC, Bobby Lee, was featured on the broadcast ‘Squawk Box’ and spoke about last year’s banning of Chinese bitcoin exchanges. Lee believes that it’s “only a matter of time” until the central bank will allow cryptocurrency exchanges to open up shop again. \nAlso Read: These Dutch Researchers Are Mining Cryptocurrencies With Body Heat\nBTCC’s Bobby Lee Is Optimistic About the PBOC Lifting the Cryptocurrency Exchange Ban\nLast year during the first month of 2017 China’s central bank initiated its first crackdowns against domestic bitcoin exchanges. At first, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) implemented a variety of regulatory guidelines but then a few months later they banned the trading platforms from trading digital currencies against the renminbi. At one time the trading platforms were the largest in the world, but Chinese exchanges haven’t traded virtual currencies in months, and the country’s leading position is now gone. However, the founder of the Chinese exchange and mining pool, BTCC, explains the PBOC will eventually lift the crypto-ban.\n“In this world, nothing is ever permanent,” explains Bobby Lee on the video broadcast ‘Squawk Box.’\n\nOne day I think it’s possible they’ll lift the so-called ban, and they might reinstitute and license [exchanges].\n\n\nMany Chinese Exchanges Have Moved Operations Abroad \nDomestic exchanges trading digital currencies is now virtually non-existent according to the world’s trading engine statistics. Many of the Chinese exchanges positioned themselves in other countries like Hong Kong. Just recently the former largest Chinese bitcoin provider in the world, Huobi, announced starting two exchanges in Japan. BTCC’s Bobby Lee says his firm has removed themselves from the Chinese bitcoin exchange realm, and the company is focused on its international payment project Mobi.   \nLee Believes Bitcoin’s Digital Scarcity Will Likely Continue to Grow Valuable \n“The more the governments and the regulators tried to put a squeeze on bitcoin, the more we see that bitcoin is actually resilient,” Lee details to the show’s host. The BTCC co-founder also thinks bitcoin’s value will continue to soar due to its digital scarcity. “Today we’re at only 1,800 of newly mined bitcoin [per] day — That used to be 7,200 as recently as five years ago. So in just a few short, maybe two and a half more years, we’ll see the supply go down again to only 900 bitcoins a day,” Lee emphasizes.\n\nSo if you talk about multi-million dollars of inflow with only new supply of 900 bitcoins a day, you can imagine where prices could be at in three, five, or ten years.\n\nLee Doesn’t Know When the PBOC Will Lift the Ban, But BTCC Is No Longer Focused on Just Being an Exchange\nEven though Lee is optimistic about the PBOC reinstating domestic exchanges in China after licensure, his firm is “no longer focused on just being an exchange business.” He also says right now it’s still hard to tell when the government in China and the central bank will lift the cryptocurrency exchange trading ban.\n“Frankly speaking, I don’t know what kind of time frame that is, whether it’s a few months, a few years or even a few decades, so it’s hard to tell,” Lee concludes.\nWhat do you think about Bobby Lee’s opinions about the PBOC lifting the crypto-exchange ban?

The company’s announcement reads:\n\nIn the foreseeable future, the goal of DMM Mining Labo is to achieve the highest per unit hash power for our machines…In the long-term future, DMM is examining options for manufacturing of their original mining machines, expanding operations beyond use of ready-made units.\n\nDMM’s Mining Plans\nThe group first announced its plans to operate “a mass-scale, made in Japan” mining farm back in September of 2017. “DMM plans [to build an] operation that ranks in [the] top three of the world’s mining farm companies in terms of scale,” the company stated at the time, adding that:\n\nDuring the year 2018, DMM will be one of the 10 largest mining farms in the world.\n\nDMM Mining Labo.\nIn its Thursday announcement, DMM said the company is “open to formalized adoption proposals of such technology from research institutes and various development corporations.” It is also looking to collaborate with major manufacturing companies. Furthermore, the lab is “prepared to run formalized testing on samples of pre-market technologies.”\nMeanwhile, another Japanese conglomerate, GMO Internet, started a mining operation through its European legal entity last month, as news.Bitcoin.com reported. GMO is using existing technology to mine at its mining center in Northern Europe while developing 7nm chips, the company detailed, adding that it is working on research and development with a partner who possesses the needed semiconductor design technology. GMO plans to use 7nm mining boards in its mining process in the first half of this year and sell them in an initial coin offering (ICO).\nGMO mining center.\nWhat do you think of DMM’s mining plans? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "text": "\n This day might be remembered in the history books as a major milestone for cryptocurrency diversification or as another colossal indicator of the altcoin bubble. There are now three cryptocurrencies with over a $100 billion market cap each. Bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) and ripple (XRP) are worth today a combined total of about half a trillion USD. \nAlso Read: After Ripple’s Rise BTC Dominance Falls Below 40%\n$100 Billion Club\nEthereum long term investors and short term speculators are celebrating alike today as the smart contracts altcoin has broken through the $1,000 per coin psychological barrier. Standing at about $1,040 at the time of writing, the overall value of all ETH in circulation is now over $100 billion. It is the third cryptocurrency in this exclusive club, behind only bitcoin and ripple.\nAnd despite all the warnings about ripple being centralized and freezable speculators keep pouring in to XRP. After rising about 160% from just a week ago and 28% in the last 24 hours alone, its market cap is now well over $140 billion. With a price of just under $4 per coin, part of this movement has to be due to penny stock mentality of new traders seeking a “cheap bitcoin” to bet on.\n Altogether, with bitcoin over $250 billion market cap, the three top cryptocurrencies are now worth just shy of $500 billion. Putting this mind boggling number into perspective, its just about 10% below the combined stock value of Visa (NYSE:V $265 billion), Mastercard (NYSE: MA $166 billion), American (NYSE: AXP $87 billion), and Discover (NYSE: DFS $28 billion).\nEntering a Multi-Polar World?\nBitcoin has been able to maintain an impressive price level at $15,000 and a quarter trillion USD market cap in the face of this altcoin onslaught, but its market share has suffered. The BTC Dominance Index is now just above 32%, a new all time low, which means that bitcoin is for first time worth less than a third of the crypto market.\nWhile some of ripple’s staunch supporters, as well as fans that heard about it a week ago, are cheering on for “The Rippening” maybe its time to forget about the term and any other Flippening. It is possible that we are simply seeing a paradigm shift in the market, from one leading cryptocurrency and a thousand copy cats to a top heavy, multi-polar landscape. This can probably only be validated in the next big correction, when all the short term speculators will scatter away and either bitcoin will remain alone at the top or not.\n\nDo you think that bitcoin will continue to lose its market dominance to altcoins in 2018?

    "text": "\n There are increasingly publicized challenges posed to the Australian cryptocurrency industry by the country’s ‘big four’ banks’ refusal to provide financial services to crypto companies. Many analysts are speculating that the issue will become the catalyst for the development of detailed regulations for the virtual currency era, arguing that the opaque nature of the current legislative apparatus pertaining to cryptocurrencies is to blame for Australia’s bitcoin banking embargo.\nAlso Read: Australian Freeze: Big Aussie Banks Denying Bitcoiners\n Many Australian Cryptocurrency Brokers Have Recently Suspended Their Services, Blaming Local Banks for Refusing to Provide Financial Services to the Industry\nLast month, Coinspot became the most high profile Australian crypto brokerage to suspend its services, criticizing the nation’s banks for the being “unwilling to work” with the cryptocurrency industry. The company claims to have persistently experienced “frequent account closures” and the imposition of “strict limits” on their bank accounts.\nSaid complaints have been echoed by a myriad of Localbitcoins vendors, with Coindance data indicating that P2P trade via the platform more than halved for the week of the 30th of December when compared with the preceding week.\nAustralia’s Leading Banks Have Sought to Dismiss Accusations of a Banking Embargo Targeting Bitcoin Businesses\nIn response to enquiries regarding the policies of the big four banks with regard to the cryptocurrency industry, Australia’s banks have largely downplayed and avoided the issue.\nA representative of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia is reported to have stated that its customers “can interact with these currencies as long as they comply with our terms and conditions and all relevant legal obligations.” The spokesperson added that “Commonwealth Bank is receptive to innovation in alternative currencies and payment systems, however, we do not currently use or recommend any existing virtual currencies as we do not believe they have yet met a minimum standard of regulation, reliability, and reputation compared to other currencies that we offer to our customers.”\nA representative of National Australia Bank (NAB) similarly stated that the bank “does not have a policy to deny customers the right to purchase bitcoin,” whilst a spokesman from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) stated that it “does not prohibit customers buying digital currencies.” A spokeswoman for Westpac stated “Westpac has controls in place to actively verify the identity of our customers and monitor the activities of those customers. Where we cannot verify the origin of transfers, we may act to ensure we comply with Australia’s anti-money laundering obligations.”\nIndustry Representatives Weigh In\nAdam Poulton, president of the Blockchain Australia Association, recently discussed the hurdles facing Australia’s cryptocurrency industry with local media, arguing that the recent dramatic influx of new crypto investors has likely contributed the banks’ hesitation to work with virtual currency businesses.\n“The volumes have grown so quickly…It’s raised a lot of red flags with the banks. They’re just seeing hundreds of thousands of dollars per day, and they’re like ‘What’s going on here? It looks like fraudulent activity, so we’ll just suspend things for a little while’.”\nAdrian Lee of the University of Technology Sydney has also weighed in on the issue, stating “There’s this murky issue of you buying something that doesn’t have any regulatory backing, and can be transferred off to do something else.”\nDo you think the industry needs greater regulatory clarity to help Australian institutions partner with cryptocurrency businesses?

The Israel-based group also revealed it has seen increased interest throughout the year in the cryptocurrency category which it first introduced back in 2013.\nAsaf Elimelech, Chief Executive Officer of Plus 500, commented: “We are pleased to announce another strong period in both revenues and profits. Momentum in the business has continued to be strong with increased interest in our cryptocurrency CFD offering and record new and active customer numbers, demonstrating our ability to serve our customers’ trading needs through product innovation and technology leadership.”\nInvestors Are Happy\nAbout 246,000 new traders joined the platform (up from 104,432 new clients in 2016) during the year which saw bitcoin rise from under $1,000 to over $19,000, another record for Plus 500. As a result, the company’s board now anticipates yearly profits for 2017 will beat previous market expectations. Following this report, the stock price of the brokerage jumped by over 20% on Wednesday and over another 6% on Thursday, completing a 192% surge compared with January 4, 2017.\nWhile cryptocurrency CFDs can expose brokers to major risks, requiring them to carefully manage their leverage, both traders and investors seem eager to have a relevant offering  on the platforms.

    "text": "\n The weekend is coming, and things are looking far more optimistic for bitcoin markets than the last two holiday weekends. BTC/USD market value has jumped considerably since it hit a low of $11,600 across global exchanges with the price now averaging $16,500 per BTC on January 5. Last week a bunch of tokens priced under $5 USD like ripple, stellar, and others had seen exponential rises while BTC markets moved sideways. Today’s BTC spike is seeing many of those coins dip in value by 15-20 percent.\nAlso read: Japan’s GDP Grows Due to Bitcoin Wealth Effect\nThe Big BTC Rebound Back to $16K\nBitcoin core markets have rebounded over the past two days as each token has gained over $1,000 in value per day. A few days ago when Peter Thiel announced he purchased millions worth of BTC the price jumped from the low $14,000 range to over $15,000 but remained stable until today. Other coins like NEM, ripple, and ethereum saw considerable jumps in value while bitcoin core markets bounced between $14900-15,200 during the last 48 hours. Today is a different story as BTC has risen to a high of $16,500 during the mid-afternoon’s trading sessions.\nToday’s most popular trade on Shapeshift with BTC is ETH. \nBTC trade volume is considerably strong with over $22Bn worth swapped over the past 24-hours. The most prominent exchanges holding the most volume today are Binance, Bitfinex, Bithumb, Bittrex, and Poloniex. South Korea’s Bithumb and other trading platforms in that region are trading bitcoin, ripple, and other digital assets at a premium. The USD is still the dominant currency traded with BTC at the moment as the currency captures 36 percent. This is followed by the Japanese yen (31%), tether (USDT 10%), the Korean won (10%) and the euro (5.6%). According to Shapeshift, the most traded cryptocurrency with bitcoin at the moment is ethereum. \nTechnical Indicators\nLooking at the charts shows things are looking up for bitcoin core (BTC) markets on January 5. The decentralized currency reached a high of $16,500 but dropped immediately after to $16,300. The two Simple Moving Averages (SMA) have a very wide gap between the 100 SMA and 200 SMA, indicating bulls are in charge for the short-term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic oscillators also suggest the path to resistance is currently on the upside. \nAt press time the price per BTC is $16,400 at 3 pm EDT. \nHeavier resistance is currently forming in the $16,800 to $17K range so look for pit stops at these vantage points. On the back side if bears manage to drag the price down some order books show some foundations at $15,800 and $15,500 for the time being. Order books show a much stronger pattern of consolidation has taken place as there is a very strong floor at $15K that should hold for a good portion of the time.\nCrypto-Markets Are About to Capture a $1 Trillion Dollar Valuation \nThere is a mix of action happening as far as other digital asset markets are concerned today. As mentioned above most of the coins that have risen considerably while BTC remained stable are now suffering from price corrections. The second highest valued cryptocurrency ripple (XRP) is down 10 percent as one XRP is $3.07. The token came awfully close to reaching $4 per XRP the day prior. The third largest market cap is held by ethereum (ETH), and the coin hit an all-time high yesterday at over $1,000 per ETH. Ethereum markets are down right now 2.6 percent as each ETH is worth $985. Bitcoin cash (BCH) has had a correlated relationship with BTC prices over the past week and a half. Volume is down a touch at $2.1Bn traded over the past 24-hours while BCH markets are up 4 percent. Each bitcoin cash is now worth $2,557 at press time. Lastly, the top five spot is still held by Cardano (ADA) but markets are down 7 percent with one ADA averaging $1.07.\nThe top ten cryptocurrency assets. \nOptimism is high on all cryptocurrency courts as many digital assets are still very valuable after the holiday dips. Alongside these technical indicators reveal the cryptocurrency ‘perma-bull run’ doesn’t seem like it’s ending anytime soon. The entire cryptocurrency market cap is steadily approaching $1 trillion USD in value and the technology being taken very seriously in the world of finance.\nBear Scenario: If bears manage to muster up some strength they could pull the price back down to the lower $15K region, but it would take a lot at this vantage point. Watch the Displaced Moving Average (DMA) break $15,200 for lower numbers. \nBull Scenario: Buyers are in control and have managed to push prices back into the $16K region. On the global level, some countries are seeing higher averages of above $17K and significant premiums compared to the global spot price. Bulls need to crack the $16,800 region to begin a larger upside battle and above $17K will be difficult as well. If they can break these zones, $18,000 is not too far from sight. \nWhere do you see the price of bitcoin and other digital assets heading from here?

Long forgotten alt bags and even abandoned projects languishing on Cryptopia mooning. Basically everything that wasn’t bitcoin mooning, bringing with it a new wave of zealots and maximalists, convinced that their coin is The One True Coin to lead the impoverished out of the wilderness and into Lamboland. Welcome to another week in bitcoin.\nAlso read: Finance ‘Guru’ James Altucher Is Launching a Cryptocurrency Exchange\nMoon Rockets: Now Leaving Hourly\nAs the meme on 4chan’s /biz/ messageboard runs, “He missed bitcoin. He missed ethereum. Surely he won’t miss [insert shitcoin]”. There was a lot of FOMO flying about this week, as “investors” (okay, gamblers) piled into the next thing that was going to make them filthy rich, or at the very least provide an easy 2x before they dropped it like a stone and moved onto the next 2x thing.\nIt’s hard to define the point at which we hit peak silliness this week. Was it when Tron, a platform with no product and no code, reached a $16 billion valuation? Was it when pre-mined Ripple’s founder became the 15th richest man in America? Or was it when heavily shilled ICO Dadi was found to have plagiarized half of SONM’s white paper and engaged in shady practices, only for some investors to shrug “Meh, it’s only got a $30 million cap. Can probably still make 300% if I flip it quick”? Even by crypto standards, this week’s been a weird one – and that’s before we get to discussing body suits that can mine cryptocurrency.\n\nThis Week in Bitcoin: Now in Podcast Format\nOn Friday, the first edition of the new Bitcoin.com podcast launched, hosted by Matt Aaron. You can listen to the debut show using the embed link below. In just six minutes, it neatly summarizes this week’s big talking points and is the perfect primer on bitcoin for anyone who was too busy to read all the articles we went to the trouble of writing this week. Future editions of the podcast will be longer: look out for the show dropping every Friday moving forward.\n\nFickle Ripple and the Big Freeze\nThere are no words.\nEveryone had a lot to say about ripple this week: we certainly did, detailing the token’s rise and rise, as well as examining the rumors that Ripple can freeze accounts. Ripple’s army of believers had a lot to say too, in the comments, on social media, and anywhere else they could make their voices heard. The week was sealed with Eric Wall examining ripple and its “one simple trick” in his trading column yesterday.\nThe week began with everyone still talking about ripple and whether, on bitcoin’s 9th birthday, it could overtake bitcoin to create The Rippening, but Stellar – developed by former Ripple cofounder Jed McCaleb – has also been on a roll. Then again, what hasn’t? There’s going to be a lot of people smarting when all these vaporwares and shitcoins crash and burn, but while bitcoin idles, silly season is showing no sign of letting up.\nRide the Lightning\nBitcoin might not be making headlines with price moves right now (save for a bounce on Tuesday when it emerged that Peter Thiel had bought a bunch), but infrastructure developments were in the news. Off-chain scaling is getting closer following successful trials of the Lightning Network.\n\nElsewhere, Venezuela released more details of its national cryptocurrency, the Petro. A government crypto tethered to barrels of oil complete with its own white paper, coming soon? We truly are living in the upside down. This week’s most popular stories concerned the fall of Bitconnect, which has been wounded but still stumbles on, for now, and a man whose Ledger Nano was cleaned out using an ingenious but dastardly reseller scam.\nAs usual, there isn’t space to delve into the remainder of this week’s most fascinating stories, such as Korean crypto exchanges poaching bank workers or the bitcoin effect causing Japan’s GDP to grow. See you next week for more highlights, including first word on whether all these newcomers succeed in finding “the next bitcoin” they’ve been searching for in crypto’s bargain bins.\nWhat was your favorite story from this week in bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

One of the biggest trends of 2015-2017 was the rise of loadable cryptocurrency debit cards backed by Visa, Mastercard, and other financial institutions. Some of the cards like the Coinbase Shift card uses cryptocurrency funds directly while other cards like the Bitpay Visa users sell their bitcoin for a balance of fiat reserves. Depending on where the crypto-enthusiast lives they can order multiple types of cards and some cards also process digital assets like ethereum and bitcoin cash. Today we’re going to discuss the wide range of digital currency loadable debit cards that are available in many different countries. \nKeep in mind that we previously reported this past week that Wavecrest Holdings Ltd. have been giving some cryptocurrency card companies issues. At the moment European issued bitcoin debit cards such as Cryptopay, Tenx, Bitwala, Bitpay (EUR), and Xapo are out of service.\n“Once we are able to service Xapo Cards in your country again, we will offer you a new card free of charge — We are hard at work to find alternative card solutions for you,” explains Xapo’s announcement on January 5, 2018.  \nBitwala Prepaid Debit Card\n\nThe Bitwala Visa card is a popular choice among European bitcoiners that offers prepaid balances in euro (EUR). The card is issued by a firm called Mychoice and a bank called Wavecrest Holdings Ltd. There is a single card load fee of 0.5 percent, and the company offers both virtual and physical cards. ATM fees cost 2.25 EUR, and all point-of-sale (PoS) transactions have no fees. Physical Bitwala debit cards can be used wherever Visa is accepted and cost €8.00, while virtual cards cost €2.00 per issuance.\nSpectrocoin Visa \n\nThe company Spectrocoin and its card service citizens living in the Baltic region. Balances can be loaded in USD, EUR, GBP with physical cards starting at €8.00 and virtual cards are sold for €0.50. There are no top-up fees, but Spectrocoin’s card charges €1.00 per month for service charges. If a resident from the Baltic States wants to use an ATM within the region or internationally prices can vary between $3.50/€2.75/£2.25 per withdrawal. Spectrocoin cards are also issued by the Mychoice company.\nThe Bitpay Visa\n\nBitpay offers a Visa card for both U.S. and European residents. Loading fees are free except when applying international currencies, and the top up also charges a bitcoin network fee. The card costs $10 USD to purchase, and the card is issued by Metropolitan Commercial Bank in the U.S. and Wavecrest Holdings for European cards. Bitpay loads are a direct sale for fiat, and the BTC spot rate is based on multiple price indexes. Bitpay’s ATM fees are $2 per withdrawal, and PoS transactions are free.\nXapo Debit Cards\n\nXapo offers a popular debit card that can be loaded with BTC, and the physical card costs roughly €18.00. The company charges €2.25 for ATM withdrawals, and PoS transactions are free. Xapo transfers have real-time conversion and users only pay bitcoin network fees for the card that’s also issued by the firm Mychoice. Xapo cards have no annual fees, and a 3 percent foreign exchange fee is applied for those types of purchase. Xapo cards are not available in the U.S.  \nCoinbase Shift Card \n\nThe Coinbase Shift card is a popular card in the U.S. which deducts balances directly from BTC, LTC, BCH, and ETH wallets. Only one cryptocurrency wallet can be tethered to the Shift card that’s accepted by over 38 million Visa-accepting merchants worldwide. The card costs $10.00 to order and has a 0 percent BTC to USD conversion fee. Domestic ATM withdrawals are $2.50 while international ATM withdrawals are $3.50. Shift cards can be connected directly with Coinbase but also can be tethered to a Dwolla account as well.   \nCoinsbank \n\nThe Coinsbank card offers both bitcoin and litecoin denominated loads offering both physical and virtual cards. The service also used to sell a “No Name” card, but the feature is temporarily unavailable. Otherwise, payments and withdrawals are only available for verified users with a card level 3. This allows cash withdrawals for verified users which is up to a 1000 EUR limit per 30 days. ATM withdrawals cost $4.95, and domestic transactions are free. There is a monthly fee of $0.95, and inactive users will be charged 4.95 if they don’t use the card after the second year. Coinsbank cards are not available in the U.S.\nWirex Card\n\nThe company Wirex offers both virtual (free) and physical debit cards ($17) that can be loaded with a Wirex account. There is a $2.50 ATM fee for the card, and a $1 monthly service fee as well. Exchanging bitcoin to fiat is free except for the miner’s fee. The Wirex Visa card works by first funding the Wirex account and adding money in a local currency (such as USD or EUR). The physical card requires verification but the Wirex virtual card no identification is required. Wirex cards are not available for U.S. users.\n29 Different Crypto-Cards Available Worldwide\nThere are many more cards available from various companies like Advcash, ANX, Mobi, and Worldcore.eu that offer different fees and can only be used in certain countries. At the moment, there are roughly 29 different debit card services that can be used with cryptocurrencies. So the idea that paying for real-world items with cryptocurrencies is difficult is kind of far-fetched. \nWhat cryptocurrency debit card do you use?

    "text": "\n Tether, creator of a USDT token claimed to be backed by the U.S. dollar, has been a hot topic of conversation lately to say the least. The company has been very successful so far issuing tokens to individuals and exchanges, but many skeptics are worried the digital currency is not backed by real fiat. Skeptics aside, just recently the company has announced the issuance of a new fiat backed tether called EURT that will represent euros with ERC20 standard compatibility.\nAlso read: French Entrepreneur’s Case to Overturn the Bitlicense Dismissed\nTether Issues Digital Fiat\nTether (USDT) is a digital asset that’s been issued over the Bitcoin core blockchain through the Omni Layer protocol. The organization that created USDTs is called Tether Limited, and according to the firm, tether tokens can always be redeemed 1:1 with the U.S. dollar through the company’s platform. Tether has been around for a couple of years now and has been very successful as a wide variety of cryptocurrencies had a phenomenal year of growth. Some skeptics believe the growth has been unnatural and tether has been accused of ‘pumping’ the entire digital asset ecosystem. These critics think there are no real dollars behind the USDT system.\nMeet the ‘EURT’\nMeanwhile, Tether Limited is now creating a euro tether (EURT) that is issued over the Ethereum blockchain and will be compatible with the ERC20 standard.        \n“As the first platform to facilitate the transfer of fiat backed currencies over a blockchain network, Tether has made headway by giving customers the ability to transfer value across the blockchain without the inherent volatility and complexity typically associated with a digital currency,” explains Tether Limited. \n\nFollowing the widespread success of our Bitcoin-based USD Tether, issued via the Omni Layer Protocol, we have today launched and issued both US Dollars and Euros as Ethereum-based Tether, compatible with the ERC20 standard. \n\nTether Limited announces the creation of USDT and EURT that are compatible with the ERC20 standard. \nSeveral of Tether Limited’s Partner Exchanges Are Working to Integrate EURTs\nThe new system allows for the transfer of both tokenized USD and EUR says the firm. Additionally, the company explains that the protocol will be interoperable with Ethereum network applications and pegged assets. \nAnother reason for the ERC20 compatible tethers means transactions will have “much lower network fees and much faster confirmation times.” Tether Limited believes this will create far more liquidity and exchange arbitrage.\n“Several partner exchanges are already working to integrate the new tokens,” reveals the firm.\nEURT Contracts Get Two Codebase Audits\nAlongside this, the company says it has completed two audits of the codebase and contracts using Zeppelin Audits and Phil Daian as third-party auditors. The inspections say there were no critical or high severity issues found and recommended some medium severity solutions. Zeppelin had updated the report and stated:  \n\nThe Tether team has followed our recommendations and updated the Tether token contract.\n\nPhil Daian’s audit is 20 pages long and concludes that if the company follows the recommendations, the ERC20 Tether contracts “will launch in a well tested, secure state.”\nWhat do you think about Tether Limited creating a euro token?

The total value of the seized coins were sold at $48.5 million. Had the government possessed them in patience, however, they would be worth $2.4 billion at current value.\nIn the next few weeks, the US government is expected to proceed with the sale of the 513 BTC and 512 BCH at the current value of around $9.4 million.\nWhat do you think of the selling?

    "text": "\n A suspect in a case involving hacking, blackmailing and Bitcoin has been arrested in Hong Kong. A 30-year-old computer technician has been taken in custody in connection with cyberattacks against two travel agencies. The man risks years of imprisonment. Personal data of customers was held for ransom. Tour operators were asked to pay 1 Bitcoin for its release. \nAlso read: Russian Crypto Expert Released After Allegedly Being Kidnapped\nSend the Bitcoin if You Want It Back\nNames, identity card numbers, passport details and phone numbers of 20,000 clients were part of the sensitive information. The companies, Big Line Holiday and Goldjoy Holidays, reported the hacking of their computers on January 1 and 2. They told police they had received emails from the unknown culprit who demanded 1 Bitcoin (about $15,000) to be paid as ransom.\nOfficers from Hong Kong’s Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) raided an apartment on Cheung Chau Island and arrested the man, South China Morning Post reported. During the operation, police seized two desktop computers, two laptops, a tablet, three hard disks and five mobile phones. They also escorted the suspect to his workplace in Kowloon on Monday to gather more evidence. He has been described by local media as an “IT worker”, a “computer technician”. The man was handcuffed on Saturday night, January 6, at his home in Cheung Chau, The Standard reported.\nThe agencies were hacked on New Year’s Day when the attacker supposedly took advantage of weakened security of their websites. The companies received an email shortly after and were told to send the Bitcoin to a newly opened address. The author of the blackmail letter threatened that if they failed to pay the ransom the personal data of their customers would be posted on the internet Saturday, a police source told SCMP. After checking thousands of logs on the servers, the Cyber Security Bureau agents managed to identify the attacker’s IP address and trace it back to the suspect.\n\nNo Bitcoin, No Ransom, No Problem\nNo sensitive information has been lost, as it was actually locked, not stolen. Police moved to apprehend the hacker hours before the ransom deadline. No charges have been levied against the suspect yet, as investigators are still questioning him and gathering information from forensic examination of hardware and software. Law enforcement officials have not ruled out further arrests as part of the ongoing investigation. The CSTCB superintendent Swalikh Mohammed described blackmail as a serious offence, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. He also warned:\n\nThe cyber world is not a lawless place. Laws applicable to the real world can also be applied to the internet\n\nBoth travel agencies have since apologized to their customers for the hacking incidents and pledged measures to improve cybersecurity. A Goldjoy representative said the company was pleased that a suspect had been apprehended so quickly. He insisted that it was highly unlikely its data storage would be hacked again after the new security upgrades. Big Line announced that it had taken immediate countermeasures after the breach. Almost $1.3 million of funding for cybersecurity improvements is available for small to medium sized businesses in the travel industry, government officials reminded.\nHong Kong’s privacy watchdog expressed concerns about the incident involving the possible theft of sensitive information. “Travel agents, as data users, should take all reasonable security measures to protect customers’ personal data,” Privacy Commissioner Stephen Wong Kai-yi said, noting a “rising trend”.\nThe latest incidents are really a second episode in the “Blackmail for Bitcoin” series. Back in November, one of the largest tour operators in the city – Worldwide Package Travel Service, announced its customer database had been hacked. Personal information, including credit card numbers, of some 200,000 people had been locked by the hackers. WWPKG was asked by the unknown blackmailers to pay a seven-figure ransom, again in Bitcoin. The company called the police and their experts managed to decrypt the data but no arrests were made.\nNo loss of financial information has been reported in either of these cases. According to data quoted by the local press, Hong Kong’s Cyber Security Bureau has recorded close to 6,000 cases of cybercrimes in 2016 alone. Financial losses, since the agency was established in 2005, have been estimated at almost $295 million.\nDo you think the rise of cryptocurrencies is related to the reported increase of cybercrimes?

Yee agreed to sell 1.219ha of land on Libaran Island to Chin for half a bitcoin ($5,758). The transaction was seal­­ed this Monday with a 10% de­­posit paid via 0.05 bitcoin, or $588 at the time the deal was signed.\nAt the signing ceremony, Chin transferred the money from his Luno wallet directly into Yee’s wallet. “It is about a new way of transferring money,” said Yee. He added that this was just an ordinary sale that was paid in bitcoin and the remaining 0.45 bitcoin would be paid once the transfer was completed.\nAnother Way to Sell Property\nEd Casson and Oliver Hookway, from Go Homes, have sold two homes in the UK for bitcoin.\nProperty developer Go Homes last December successfully sold two luxury homes in the UK using bitcoin currency.\nThe first property sold was a four-bedroom detached £350,000 family house in Colchester. The unnamed buyer is a bitcoin miner who made an early killing on the cryptocurrency. He bought the new house as an investment property in hopes of renting it out in bitcoin. The buyer of the second property, a £595,000 four-bed townhouse in Hertfordshire, is also a bitcoin miner.\n“This re-writes the rule book and shows there is another way to sell property,” said Ed Casson, group sales director of Go Homes. He believed that selling homes for bitcoin will become common in the next five years as it benefits both buyers and sellers due to transactions being swift. “Because bitcoin is so volatile purchasers buy a property outright, with no deposit,” added Ed Casson. “They exchange and complete at the same time.”\nThe Early Days of the Internet\nThis trend is seen globally. An Australian vendor planned to sell a family house in Melbourne’s outer east and was willing to accept Bitcoin as payment.\nRob, an experienced builder, whose latest project, 1411 Mountain Highway, The Basin, is up for sale with its listing declaring the “owner is agreeable to accept part payment in Bitcoin”.\n“I see cryptocurrency at the moment as like the early days of the internet dot com era,” said Rob. But at the same time, he is also aware of the financial risks involving in trading bitcoin.\n\nA day in bitcoin is like a week or a month in the real world.

According to Wang, he deposited 1.4 million yuan at Huobi to speculate on bitcoin in October of 2016. But within a few months, he couldn’t handle the pressure to see himself losing money, and cashed out once and for all.\nThe plaintiff told the court that his trades at Huobi should be invalidated because bitcoin doesn’t exist:\n\nBitcoin does not exist and is not a legal tender. Marxism says that a commodity  should have price and value and clearly bitcoin can not be classed as a commodity. Besides, bitcoin is not a real currency for it is not issued by the central bank. Therefore, it shall not be used to trade or as a payment method.\n\nHuobi argued that Wang doesn’t understand what bitcoin is. And it’s not Huobi that traded with him, it’s other users at the platform. Huobi only serves as a third-party platform that has been operating lawfully. Huobi added that the price of bitcoin is decided by the market, not by the platform.\nAnother two Beijing-based companies pleaded that they only help Huobi receive users’ deposits. As such, they have nothing to do with Wang’s losses.\nThe Court Judgement\nThe People’s Court of Haidian District, Beijing dismissed the lawsuit, saying investors should be responsible for their own losses. The court judgement explained:\n\nWhen users trade bitcoin they are supposed to fully understand relative risks concerning it. They should invest only the amount they can afford to lose and undertake all responsibilities.\n\nThe court judge noted that bitcoin is not a commodity. It has no use value. The PBOC has no right to define bitcoin as a virtual commodity. And Huobi has no right to trade bitcoin. It can only offer trade services.\nWhat do you think of the lawsuit?

This means BTC has lost 82.65% of its value since that day. In fact, a large majority of digital currencies touched all-time highs last year at this time and have not returned to those levels since. The entire crypto-economy at the time had around 1,600 coins but was valued at close to half a trillion U.S. dollars. Now there are over 2,000 coins and the market is only worth $100 billion, so it’s safe to say there have been some significant changes in the interim.\nOne year ago today bitcoin core (BTC) touched all-time highs. \nDigital Currency Markets Show Slight Recovery\nToday the price of BTC is up 5.2% and has been steadily making gains during the early morning trading sessions.

The top currency pairs swapped with BCH on Dec. 17 include BTC (39.6%), ETH (29%), USDT (23.2%), USD (3.8%), and the EUR (1.5%). Furthermore, the Japanese yen is right behind the euro at 1.3% of BCH global trades.\nBCH/USD 4-hour Bitstamp on Dec. 17, 2018. \nBCH/USD Technical Indicators \nLooking at the four-hour BCH/USD chart on Bitstamp shows bulls have been attempting to push higher over the last 12 hours. Relative Strength Index (RSI) is resting at -53, just above previously oversold conditions. The current formation on the 30-minute BCH/USD chart and the RSI/MACd levels shows a touch of bullish divergence. The long-term 200 Simple Moving Average (SMA) however is still riding above the short-term 100 SMA. \nBCH/USD 4-hour Bitstamp on Dec. 17, 2018.\nThis indicates that the path toward least resistance is still the downside, but the two trendlines look as though they may cross hairs which could signal further price upswings. Order books on Bitstamp show bulls need to surpass the current vantage point and walls above the $95 price zone. On the backside, there are some seemingly solid foundations between now and the $75 range.\nHas the Crypto Speculation Period Run Dry?\nMany cryptocurrency traders are still skeptical even though there’s been some slight recovery today. For instance, there’s been a lot going on within the global economy with tech stocks and equities starting to slump. Many people are starting to think the cryptocurrency speculation era is ending.  Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz explained earlier this week that crypto participants are seeing things more clearly now. “The audience is more sober now – the drug is gone … but it’s not going to zero — we’re at the methadone clinic,” Novogratz emphasized.\nCryptocurrency and fiat money flow over the past 24 hours according to Coinlib.io. \nThe CEO of Bitpay, Stephen Pair, hopes to see actual utility rise in the next five years because this is what his firm concentrates on. “A very big component of the price is certainly speculation. It’s investors that are speculating on the future usage and adoption of this technology — I’m sure a small component of that price is the actual utility,” Pair stated during an interview with CNBC on Dec. 13. \nOverall, long-term cryptocurrency proponents are quite confident in the value of digital assets over the next five years to a decade. The biggest question right now is how long the current bearish trend will lead the crypto-economy and whether or not the bottom is really in. \nWhere do you see the price of BCH, BTC and other coins heading from here?

    "text": "\n The U.K. government has said that individual investors will be liable to pay capital gains tax each time they sell crypto assets such as BTC for profit. In new taxation guidelines published Dec. 19, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) also stated that digital assets received from employers in lieu of cash or gained from mining activities and airdrops will be taxed in line with existing income tax and national insurance contribution laws.\nAlso read: Bibox Buys 100% Shares of Decentralized Exchange Dex.top \nTaxing Crypto-Assets Case by Case\n\nGovernments throughout the world are trying to cash in on the thriving blockchain and cryptocurrency industry via a range of individual and corporate tax measures. The latest HMRC taxation framework excludes British digital asset businesses and companies and “does not explicitly consider” those tokens held by individuals for business purposes.\n“The tax treatment of crypto-assets continues to develop due to the evolving nature of the underlying technology and the areas in which crypto-assets are used,” explained the revenue collector. “As such, HMRC will look at the facts of each case and apply the relevant tax provisions according to what has actually taken place (rather than by reference to terminology),” it added.\nThe British tax agency has tended to look at virtual currencies more as property than as currency. It reiterated this position in the new policy document while emphasizing that cryptocurrency trading was not “gambling.”\nCapital gains payable on cryptocurrency sales – in this context treated as property – may be between 10 percent and 28 percent depending on the taxpayer’s rate of income. Investors who earn money from mining, transaction fees or airdrops “that are provided in return for or in expectation of a service” will be required to pay income tax and contribute to the national insurance scheme, the agency detailed. HMRC stated:\nIn the vast majority of cases, individuals hold crypto-assets as a personal investment, usually for capital appreciation in its value or to make particular purchases. They will be liable to pay capital gains tax when they dispose of their crypto-assets.\nIt added that “there may be cases where the individual is running a business which is carrying on a financial trade in crypto assets and will therefore have taxable trading profits. This is likely to be unusual, but in such cases income tax would take priority over the capital gains tax rules.”\n European Regulators Circle in on Cryptocurrencies\nThroughout Europe, regulators have complained that cryptocurrencies are risky, and repeatedly alleged that they help to fuel money laundering and terrorism while placing investor funds at the mercy of fraudsters. Their alarmist entreaties have ramped up pressure on governments to act, with many promulgating a series of regulations ostensibly to safeguard public funds and prevent the risk of financial instability.\n\nIn October, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority announced  plans to ban crypto-linked derivative products. It also said that fiat-to-crypto exchanges and custodian wallet providers will be brought within the scope of anti-money laundering regulation. The intention is to enhance consumer protection and curb illicit financial flows.\nHMRC’s taxation guidelines will inevitably ring-fence taxes and prevent tax evasion, particularly on an asset class that up until now has appeared to be largely exempt from regulatory oversight. In its report, the revenue collector also speaks about taxation related to forked digital coins, lost private keys, stolen assets and others. Hard-forked coins will generally be liable for capital gains tax, but HMRC “will consider cases of difficulty as they arise.”\nWhat are your thoughts on the new taxation guidelines from HMRC?

The company recently launched an exchange in Singapore. Over 130 coins and 240 trading pairs will be offered on both of the new Upbit exchanges, according to their websites.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space\nLatest Expansion Plan\nUpbit, one of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has been marketing new crypto exchanges in Thailand and Indonesia in their local languages, according to local media. The company has set up a website for each exchange.\nEdaily reported Upbit describing on Friday that “Both countries appreciate the growth potential of the cryptocurrency industry.” The exchange was quoted by the publication as saying:\n\nThailand and Indonesia are very interested in blockchain and cryptocurrency, so we thought it would be a good thing to have an online presence before launch.\n\nUpbit is operated by Dunamu Inc., an affiliate of Kakao Corp. which operates the country’s most popular chat app, Kakaotalk. Upbit is also affiliated with U.S.-based exchange Bittrex.\nDunamu CEO Lee Seok-woo has been planning overseas expansion for his exchange. “From the outset of the Upbit business, the company had a blueprint to become a global foreign exchange, not limited to the domestic market,” the news outlet detailed.\nRecently, Upbit officially launched an exchange in Singapore that supports Singapore dollars. The company plans for the new exchanges to support the baht in Thailand and the rupiah in Indonesia.\nUpbit Thailand\n“Prepare to meet Upbit Thailand soon” is the message displayed on the front page of the Thai Upbit website. The exchange also states that its service is in “closed beta” phase and is currently available only to a limited number of early registrants. There will be 131 coins listed and 241 trading pairs.\n\nThe Thai government enacted cryptocurrency regulations in May. It is currently evaluating a number of applicants wanting to operate in the crypto space. Six crypto exchanges and one dealer have been allowed to operate in the country while their applications are being reviewed since they were in business prior to the regulations. The central bank has also greenlighted commercial banks to create subsidiaries for cryptocurrency activities.\nUpbit Indonesia\nUpbit’s Indonesian website is less developed than its Thai counterpart. “Buy and sell the latest crypto assets from our partner, Bittrex, the premium exchange from the United States” is the translation of the message displayed on its front page. According to the website, 156 coins and 276 trading pairs will be supported.\n\nIn June, the Indonesian Futures Exchange Supervisory Board signed a decree to regulate cryptocurrencies as commodities.\nDomestic Environment\nZdnet described last week that the expansion to Thailand and Indonesia is Upbit’s effort to increase its overseas user base, stating:\n\nUpbit is experiencing difficulties in increasing users because it has not been able to issue a new real-name account since January of this year. Upbit has said it plans to step up its overseas expansion, starting with Southeast Asia.\n\nThe South Korean government implemented the real-name system in January. However, banks have been reluctant to provide this service to crypto exchanges. So far, they have only offered the real-name conversion service to the country’s top four crypto exchanges, including Upbit.\n“I am in a desperate situation which I can lose a great opportunity if I miss this period,” Edaily quoted Lee as saying. He further explained that while “the situation in Korea is not good due to various regulations,” competition is increasing. Lee emphasized:\n\nIf we wait for the domestic trading environment to improve, we will be left behind in the global market.\n\nWhat do you think of Upbit launching crypto exchanges in Thailand and Indonesia?

    "text": "\n DMG Blockchain Solutions has announced that it has started consuming up to 60 megawatts (MW) of electricity at an 85MW substation in western Canada. It will use the substation to power its flagship cryptocurrency mining facility, which is one of the largest such sites in the country by power output. \nAlso Read: Vietnam at Crossroads on Cryptocurrency Regulations\nDMG Partially Powers New Mining Facility\nThe Vancouver-based company has started operations at its 27,000-square-foot cryptocurrency mine, which sits on a 34-acre site in British Columbia. The electricity used by the mine is estimated to be enough to power 50,000 homes.\nThe facility is believed to be the second-biggest mining operation in Canada. The site is powered by clean hydroelectric power and will not have an impact on the electricity distributed to the local community.\n“DMG now proudly owns one of the largest, most cost-efficient, bitcoin mining facilities in North America,” said Dan Reitzik, chief executive officer of DMG. “It was an audacious undertaking, but DMG’s executive team has been in the mining space for years, and we have the know-how and connections with the utilities and government agencies to pull it off.”\nThe site will provide low-cost energy to DMG, as well as third-party customers via its mining-as-a-service operation. The construction of the crypto mine took approximately one year. As part of the announcement, DMG also said that Simon Padgett has stepped down from his role as the director of the company.\nHut8 and Bitfury Still Operate Largest Mine in Canada\nDMG’s new facility is expected to hold the distinction of being the most powerful cryptocurrency mine in Canada once it is fully powered. However, at the moment it still falls shy of a 63MW site that Hut8 and Bitfury are jointly operating in Medicine Hat, Alberta. Unlike DMG’s facility, the operation in Medicine Hat is powered by the local grid, which uses natural gas to generate electricity.\n“I’m in the business of making electricity and selling it to industrial users,” Ted Clugston, the mayor of Medicine Hat, recently stated. He also described the cryptocurrency mining industry as comprising “mining for ones and zeros” by converting “gas into electricity, which is being turned into Bitcoins.”\nDo you think crypto mining poses a challenge to the environment, or is it a form of electricity arbitrage across the global market?

    "text": "\n As the days draw closer to the scheduled Bitcoin Cash upgrade, affiliated organizations are preparing for the hard fork. Data websites like Coin Dance have added statistics for feature support, upgrade voting, and public opinion. Meanwhile, the Nchain-backed SV-Pool has officially announced that its pool is now open to public miners.\nAlso Read: Samsung Begins 7nm Chip Production\nSV-Pool Goes Public \nThe Bitcoin Cash hard fork slated for Nov. 15 is getting closer and network participants are preparing for the upgrade in several ways. On Oct. 22, the mining initiative SV-Pool, supported by Nchain and the firm’s chief scientist Craig Wright, announced the pool is now open to the public. This means that Bitcoin Cash miners can direct their hashrate towards the SV-Pool and get paid by an initial pay-per-last-n-shares (PPLNS) system. The pool details it plans to add more payment structures this November. At the time of writing, according to Coin Dance statistics, SV-Pool has been capturing around 2.6 percent of the global BCH hashrate over the last seven days.\nAccording to the pool’s recent announcement, SV-Pool says it stands by a “miners’ choice, miners first philosophy.” News.Bitcoin.com reported on the pool’s first mined block on Oct. 10 and at the time SV-Pool was using an invitation-only beta period. During that time, the Bitcoin SV team launched its codebase and the Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) team also launched a new client. The latest BU code is prepared for the Bitcoin ABC team’s ruleset changes and the team stated on Twitter that SV ruleset compatibility was “pending.” BU’s plan is to let the miners vote for features by using a system called the BIP135 bits standard.\n\nExplicit Mining Pool Support and Public Opinion \nFollowing the recent announcements concerning new clients and BIP135, the statistical data website Coin Dance has prepared its website for things like explicit mining pool support by proposal and a new politics and public opinion section. The explicit mining pool support section, which seems to incorporate the most important data to most BCH proponents, currently says that “Voting should begin shortly.” The politics and public opinion section is a different story as it shows a list of BCH-supporting businesses and organizations revealing specific proposal stances. \nExplicit mining pool support says it will begin shortly according to Coin Dance statistics. \nAs of Oct. 23, there are 15 organizations listed on the page which Coin Dance details is a “weighted community-managed support breakdown by company for each active Bitcoin Cash proposal.” The three choices include support for BIP135, Bitcoin SV, and Bitcoin ABC’s ruleset proposals. Companies and organizations represented on the list include Bitcoin ABC, Unlimited, XT, Cryptograffiti, Coingeek, Nchain, Coinex, Blockchain Ventures, and more. People visiting this weighted support breakdown can see whether or not each firm supports a certain ruleset proposal. Coin Dance is allowing company submissions and a form can be filled out that requires the organization to be publicly accessible, indicate explicit choices, and source references. \nCoin Dance also shows a weighted community-managed support breakdown of public opinion by company.\nThere are only 23 days left until the scheduled hard fork, and so far it is hard to determine how the upgrade will play out, even for those constantly watching and listening to the BCH community. Most BCH supporters are more concerned with the miners’ explicit decisions over a weighted community-managed poll system. Miners don’t have to run BU in order to vote using the BIP135 bits standard, as they can also set the bits in their block version fields using mining pool software. \nWhat do you think about the Bitcoin Cash network hard fork scheduled for November 15?

    "text": "\n The following opinion piece on crypto regulations was written by Benjamin Pirus, a crypto trader who has written many articles for different ICOs, crypto news outlets, and clients.\nGovernment protection and regulations may provide reasons for thankfulness. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t significant frustrations and need for change in the current system. Regulation leads to normal citizens being inhibited or even put at risk in many ways. Definite need for change exists in two particular areas: the current United States accredited investor laws, and current overall KYC expectations.\nAlso Read: Wave of Mobile Tax Hikes Squeeze Africa’s Poor to Indulge Governments\nWith tokenized securities just around the corner, as well as recent ICO regulation, the U.S. accredited investor law has been the topic of much discussion. Under current laws, Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), as well as many ICOs, ban U.S. citizens from investing unless they are deemed to be certified accredited investors. \nAccredited Investor Difficulties\nAccording to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), an accredited investor is described as anyone who has “earned income that exceeded $200,000 (or $300,000 together with a spouse) in each of the prior two years, and reasonably expects the same for the current year, OR has a net worth over $1 million, either alone or together with a spouse (excluding the value of the person’s primary residence)”. \nThe above described law prevents a significant portion of the United States from investing. This is extremely frustrating because there are often many people with more than enough knowledge to invest but are barred from participation. Just because someone has significant money, doesn’t mean they know how to properly handle it. \nIn a recent interview, Desico (tokenized securities) co-founder and CEO Laimonas Noreika explained that “there are significant amounts of accredited investors who lack expertise in areas, but still have enough money to achieve accreditation. On the opposite side, millions of people do not have enough money for accreditation, but have more than enough knowledge to decide where and why they want to invest. We want to see both of these groups included.”\nThe Frustration\nThis is unendingly frustrating for educated individuals who see opportunity but are not legally allowed to capitalize on it. This also hurts companies and ICOs, as many are prohibited from initial involvement. Most are forced to invest once significant gains have already been made. \nAnthony Pompliano (founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital) talks about how it has literally been written into law that “rich people get richer”… “the highest returning assets that are available to any investor, are only going to be available to people who have a certain financial status”… “to me, it’s a violation of the American dream”. \nInteresting Solution\nPompliano then goes on to describe an interesting solution that’s found in Europe – the “opt-in system”, which essentially allows individuals to claim their capability, but also acknowledge their understanding of the risks associated, and are therefore willing to receive less investor protection. Basically, it lets the investor account for his or her own decisions and actions. This system seems like a much better solution.  \nKYC Laws Put Participants at Risk\nIt’s not just the accredited investor law that’s frustrating here though. Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws in general are not only frustrating, but also put participants at risk. KYC/AML basically includes that customers must verify their identities, as well as “confirm they’re not on any prohibited lists and assessing their risk factors”.\nWhy is this harmful? Because it can be a one-way street. For example, people often must send their license, social security number, picture, etc., in order to partake in services, such as certain regulated crypto exchanges. \nBut what assurance does the customer have that their personal information is safe with said entity? Or even that they are not sending their private information to a scam artist? This is frustrating, as the customer must decide either to incur such risk or walk away from an opportunity. \nEven if the the company requesting KYC is legitimate, the customer’s private information may be at risk, depending on how the contents are uploaded or delivered. And this again, is only a risk to the customer if their data is apprehended.\nBanning Crypto Investment Participation \nMany crypto exchanges even ban US participation, possibly because they do not want to have to deal with the KYC and regulation laws associated. This is difficult for the U.S. customer who desires to abide by the rules (without using a VPN) but is simply forced to look for other, less adequate, options. \nThese rules are valid in some ways. It’s important to ensure that money isn’t funding terrorism or illegal activity. And, of course, national protection is extremely important. But, citizens’ information and opportunity must also be protected.\nSo what’s the solution? There may be many solutions. True protection for citizens being acknowledged may be seen in self-sovereign identity and smart contracts. For example, if KYC is required in the future, perhaps citizens should be able to simply sign a smart contract with their private keys, in order to verify their private information, without exposing them to risk. This would satisfy both individuals and government parties. \nWhatever the solutions may be for accredited investor laws, and KYC, people would likely benefit from reform in these areas. \nWhat do you think about Securities, KYC, and AML laws in the crypto space? Are these laws even necessary?  Images courtesy of Shutterstock OP-ed disclaimer: This is an Op-ed article. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.

    "text": "\n Centbee of South Africa has announced the launch of its bitcoin cash wallet app in beta, as adoption continues to grow in Africa and elsewhere around the world. Some shops in Kenya already accept bitcoin cash for purchases.\nDisclaimer: On November 15, 2018, the Bitcoin Cash chain bifurcated into two chains. There is now a network called – Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV) – and Centbee the company/wallet/infrastructure provider mentioned in this editorial has chosen to support the BSV chain. Sending Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to a BSV wallet/address or vice versa can lead to financial losses.\nCentbee Wallet App Allows Users to Send Bitcoin Cash to Friends via Mobile\nSouth African cryptocurrency firm Centbee has released the beta version of its bitcoin cash wallet, allowing users to send BCH to one another via cellphone. The app, which allows people to receive, hold, and spend BCH, has been in alpha testing for the past few months, with users trying out its performance through test coins. Users have asserted that “its most useful feature is the ability to send bitcoin cash to friends by selecting from their phone’s contacts list,” according to reports.\nCentbee co-chief executive officer Angus Brown said he was “extremely confident of the final product” after the company included comments from customers in the beta version. “Cryptocurrency as a form of payment costs a fraction of what users would pay using their bank accounts, especially for cross-border payments. This is the future of money,” he was quoted as saying.\n\nWe're in BETA!\nDownload @CentbeeWallet on the App Store or Google Play and start sending Bitcoin cash to your friends simply by tapping your phone contacts.\nDownload on Google Play: https://t.co/GisusqxWA2\nDownload on the App Store:https://t.co/RaRfj4CzNe#BitcoinCash #BCH pic.twitter.com/sZJoClSiY4\n— Centbee ™ (@Centbee) October 2, 2018 Africa Sees Steady Growth in BCH Adoption\nBitcoin cash offers reliable, fast and inexpensive cryptocurrency transactions when compared to traditional means of sending money. In Africa, the cryptocurrency, which split from bitcoin core just over a year ago, has seen steady growth as a payment means for goods and services. According to the Coinline bitcoin cash directory of merchants, BCH as a payment method is currently established in two countries on the continent, Kenya and South Africa, though it continues to flourish elsewhere in the world.\nBCH merchant directory\nIn South Africa, the latest launch proves the growing acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrency, regardless of regulatory concerns and falling virtual currency prices. South Africa, which recently gained its first multi-currency crypto ATM, has this year consistently ranked highest worldwide in search interest for “bitcoin”, according to data from Google Trends.\nBoxlight Electronics, a Kenyan company that distributes a range of electrical gadgets including television sets and home theaters, now accepts payment in bitcoin core and bitcoin cash. Robinson Murage, chief executive officer of Boxlight Electronics, has said previously: “We have received tons of requests from our customers to pay using digital currencies. As a company whose 90% of customers are young, tech savvy and predominantly online we choose to be all inclusive and adapt to the needs of those that prefer this type of currency.”\nAt Centbee in South Africa, co-chief executive Lorien Gamaroff explained: “Our key focus in designing the app was to make sending bitcoin cash to friends as simple as possible. In just a few taps, users can send bitcoin cash to anyone, anywhere at the lowest possible cost. Bitcoin cash will be adopted globally as the best way to pay, especially in Africa and other developing markets.”\nWhat do you think about Centbee’s new wallet app and the adoption of bitcoin cash in Africa?

    "text": "\n From time to time we all need a reminder that Bitcoin is much more than just an asset that can be checked on a daily price chart. Peter Thiel reveals that he believes the “crypto vs AI dichotomy” will shape the future of humanity, presenting us with a choice between a Big Brother totalitarian government and a world of greater liberty.\nAlso Read: Abra App Launches Support for Bitcoin Cash Deposits and Withdrawals\nPeter Thiel Talks Bitcoin\nPeter Thiel, the Paypal co-founder and venture capital billionaire known to be long on Bitcoin, has given a lengthy interview on The Rubin Report discussing his views on many subjects. After starting the discussion by refusing to smoke a joint on the air to avoid competing with his fellow Paypal co-founder Elon Musk, Thiel explained that they initially thought about the idea for the company because he was very interested in cryptocurrency and new forms of money for the internet age.\nFor the next two hours or so he discussed many other interesting subjects before finally returning to focus on cryptocurrency. These included his support for now president Donald Trump, investing in Facebook, generational economics, contrarian thinking, the problems with Silicon Valley, sexuality, freedom of the press versus the right to privacy (the Gawker Hulk Hogan sex tape saga), seastanding and much more.\n\nAI Big Brother vs Crypto Utopia\nThiel explained his view regarding cryptocurrencies, saying: “…on Bitcoin, so if crypto is libertarian, AI is communist. Everyone thinks crypto is libertarian because you have all these ideas about decentralizing money and things like this. Nobody says AI is communist and that’s because we are sort of more conscious of people with different views like libertarian and we are less conscious of people with collectivist views because that’s more the zeitgeist. But I think…the crypto versus AI dichotomy goes to the sort of question about what’s the future of the computer age going to look like. And is it going to be more centralized or more decentralized.”\n“In history we’ve had these very different pictures [of the future]. In the late 60s, the early Star Trek episodes you had one planet they got to where there was one big computer that ran the whole planet for 8,000 years. And the people didn’t have any thoughts. They were all docile, kind of happy. Nothing ever happened and that was what the people thought the future would be in the late 60s. That was in the late 60s when we had centralized big computers. In the late 90s, it was going to be crypto, to be decentralized. The internet was going to split up all these sorts of structures.”\n\n68 was centralized, 98 was decentralized, in 2018 in some ways the pendulum has swung back to centralized. Big governments, big databases that can monitor and survey people and know more about you than you know about yourself. Or things like this sort of creepy, big brother type thing.\n\n“I think since the pendulum has swung back and forth so much over the last 50 years, there is no reason that that’s the future. And it’s actually a choice. Do we want it to be centralized? Do we want it to be decentralized? And what I think AI can mean many different things but if it means you have large databases that are controlled by large governments that can monitor people more effectively, it’s something that could make communism maybe more effective, certainly more scary, more totalitarian than it ever was in the 20th century. It’s not a coincidence along these lines that the Chinese communist party hates crypto and loves AI.”\nHow will these technologies shape the future of humanity?

    "text": "\n Since the inception of cryptocurrency, some critics have dubbed it “just another fiat money.” This has been the wail of anti-crypto combatants. They have succumbed to grasping at straws in order to manufacture any rebuttal against the thing they loathe. It doesn’t matter how valid the argument is so long as it satisfies their desire to smear crypto. \nAlso read: A Third of Humanity Remains Financially Excluded\nNon-Argument\nUsing this kind of non-argument is akin to raising the dead. When one cannot count on truth to win the day, they reach back in time to deploy old, tired bromides. Jimmy Song performed his own ritual for the dead during a debate with Roger Ver at the Coinsbank Cruise on September 10th.\nInstead of articulating a legitimate problem with bitcoin cash, Jimmy claimed it is a “centralized fiat money.” This is virtually the same broken premise crypto-antagonists have trotted out ever since Satoshi penned the white paper, including naysayers like Peter Schiff. It was a tragedy to witness, because fiat currency means something entirely different than what Jimmy believed.\nWhat is Fiat Currency?\nFiat currency is money that is issued by decree or formal authorization. To be more specific, by decree means it is backed by a government’s alleged authority, and then enforced on the population by law — at the barrel of a gun. Generally, when a money is decreed by government, using other kinds of competing paper money is considered a criminal act.\nFor example, when Bernard Von Nothaus created the Liberty Dollar and attempted to put it into circulation, thugs in costumes raided his company headquarters. They put him in jail and charged him with counterfeiting and fraud.\nRoger Ver\nNo one is forcing anyone to use bitcoin cash. No men in costumes are coming to arrest those who use bitcoin cash. It is an opt-in, voluntary cryptocurrency.\nHere is the definition of “fiat” according to Investopedia:\n“Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity.”\nWhy Bitcoin Cash is not Fiat currency\nThis is why bitcoin cash, or any other crypto, is not fiat. It is not decreed or authorized by government. It is not “legal tender.” It is possible that a digital currency can eventually be decreed, but then it is likely the “cryptocurrency” in question will not be cryptocurrency in the traditional sense.\nFor example, the Russian government has talked about creating the “Crypto Ruble,” which would act as their version of cryptocurrency. The problem is it would not be minable, and it would be manipulable by that government. A true cryptocurrency would not possess these “features.”\nJimmy’s Arguments\nJimmy claimed bitcoin cash was fiat currency, because he believed it is “authorized authoritatively.” Jimmy mentioned bitcoin cash was “paternalistic and Keynesian.” He also said it was “controlled by a central authority.”\nJimmy Song, left.\nBitcoin cash is an open-source and peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that anyone can get involved in and use. It is not “Keynesian.” The amount of cryptocurrency issued into existence cannot be arbitrarily determined. It is determined by the protocol, and is the exact same as bitcoin: 21 million units will be minted by year 2140.\nKeynesian economists believe the economy should be controlled and stabilized by government printing of money to prevent economic catastrophe. The bitcoin cash protocol functions antithetically to Keynesian ideology. No one can arbitrarily inflate or deflate the supply of bitcoin cash.\nClearly, Jimmy did not read the primary source on Keynesian economics as Roger pointed out.\nCrypto Centralization\nJimmy might have only been trying to argue that bitcoin cash is centralized. However, that is a MUCH DIFFERENT argument than claiming bitcoin cash is fiat. Of course, most people who claim some crypto is “centralized” do not really define what they mean by “centralized.” Bitcoin and bitcoin cash are also both a bit centralized in terms of mining operations. However, the problem is overstated.\nMining in bitcoin and bitcoin cash is more centralized as a result of limited adoption. This means only a handful of mining pools control the networks. However, the more users that begin to adopt cryptocurrency, the more mining operations will appear. This will mitigate the problem of centralization. Regardless, what matters is cryptocurrency remains censorship resistant.\nIn this regard, bitcoin cash is more censorship resistant than bitcoin core, which has had transactions censored because they got stuck in the mempool when fees skyrocketed. In this sense, one can make the case that bitcoin core is less censorship resistant than bitcoin cash. Therefore, bitcoin core is more “centralized.”\nCrypto Paternalism and the Case for Op-Codes\nJimmy’s claim that bitcoin cash is paternalistic was the most problematic comment of the debate. A paternalistic cryptocurrency would mean that it is controlled by an oligarchic cult of developers. In terms of the ecosystem, bitcoin cash does not fit this criteria. It is truly open source in the sense that developers have wide-ranging leeway to build protocols on top of it.\nMany of the op-codes have been re-enabled on the bitcoin cash protocol. This means developers have the ability to create new tools and programs. Some have already been developed, such as the Wormhole protocol and platforms like Memo.cash. Ironically, this is impossible on the bitcoin core network because of a mixture of high fees, disabled op-codes, and developer hegemony.\nIf anything, bitcoin core is more “paternalistic” and strict in terms of who has the right to develop on top of the protocol in a truly open source fashion. What protocol is really the most “paternalistic”?\n\nConclusion: Mind your Argument, Jimmy\nIn the end, Jimmy could not muster a strong argument against bitcoin cash so he resurrected a long-dead one and resorted to hand-wringing and arm-waving. The tragedy is there are certainly questions that need to be addressed regarding bitcoin cash, but it being a “fiat money” is not one of them.\nThis suggests Jimmy did not intend on making a case against bitcoin cash, but instead wanted to incite drama during a debate. It was just surprising that he would have premised his whole position on an argument that some people make against bitcoin core itself. That alone should have signaled to him that he was reaching.\nDo you think bitcoin or bitcoin cash is fiat currency? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "text": "\n It’s become fashionable in public circles to bash Bitcoin on account of its energy consumption. Virtually every week, mainstream media (MSM) attacks bitcoin mining, painting alarmist pictures of a planet burning due to the ‘wasteful’ design of Proof of Work. The reality is less cut-and-dried. Bitcoin’s defenders have been hitting back lately, with one new study highlighting the many positives of PoW.\nAlso read: Ludicrous Headlines About Bitcoin Mining Will Kill Us All\nThe Case Against Proof of Work\n“It’s become popular today to dismiss Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work as wasteful and bad for the environment,” observes a paper published on August 30 by Node Blockchain’s Saad Imran. Search for ‘bitcoin’ on any MSM website and you’re sure to find an article likening Bitcoin Core’s energy consumption to that of Ireland/Iceland/Whatever country’s annual energy bill it’s currently surpassed. Those estimates overstate BTC’s energy bill by at least a third, but even if one was to take their claim as gospel, they miss the point.\n“Gravity”, part one of a four-part Medium discourse on Bitcoin’s Proof of Work model, begins by acknowledging this point, its author writing sarcastically: “The cryptopocalypse is coming. Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) is so bad that it’s going to destroy the world in 2020”. One of the problems that many of these reports make is to equate the number of bitcoin transactions with the cost of mining, whereas the reality is there is no relation between the two: whether a bitcoin block is full or empty, the cost of mining it remains the same.\n“Gravity”‘s author highlights alarmist MSM headlines on bitcoin mining\nThe Case For Proof of Work\nNode Blockchain’s study cites a couple of reasons why bitcoin mining can be regarded as having “positive externalities”. One of these is the fact that as hardware advances reach a point of diminishing returns, the only way for miners to remain profitable will be to seek cheaper energy sources. “Since the physical location of mining centers is not important to the Bitcoin network, miners flock to areas generating surplus electricity for the lowest marginal costs. In the long-run, this has the potential to produce more efficient worldwide energy markets with Bitcoin miners performing an arbitrage of electricity between global centers,” it asserts.\nBitcoin arbitrage is typically thought of in the context of traders seeking price differences between exchanges. The concept of “energy arbitrage” makes sense though, as that is the game that miners are playing as they relocate to regions that can meet their needs. In the long term, only renewable energy sources can realistically fulfill this demand, and thus it is logical to expect Bitcoin’s reliance on so-called ‘brown’ energy to diminish.\nNot only are miners increasingly switching to green energy, but they’re driving innovations to reuse ‘wasted’ energy and excess production that would not otherwise have been utilized. Examples include initiatives to capture natural gas let off from oil wells by ‘flaring’ i.e. burning. One company has developed mining hardware that captures this energy and converts it into electricity. Elsewhere, wasted automobile tires are being converted into energy and used for the same purpose.\nProof of Work Is Getting Greener\nSaad Imran’s paper concludes: “It’s important as well to review the electricity usage against the closest comparable, global data centers, which today consume over 2% of worldwide electricity (a measure that is 133x larger than Bitcoin’s usage). Why is it claimed that Bitcoin’s electricity usage is wasteful yet these other uses are largely considered ‘fair’?”\n“Whataboutery” – excusing Bitcoin’s energy consumption by pointing out the wastefulness of other industries – doesn’t change the fact that PoW mining is energy intensive. Unlike datacenters, gold mining, and every other industry that consumes vast amounts of energy, however, mining is obligated to become more efficient and thus more environmentally friendly with time. Miners wishing to stay in the game have two choices: reduce their energy bill or be priced out of business. They don’t need to switch to renewables for ethical reasons: transitioning for financial reasons alone will suffice.\nDo you think mainstream media are guilty of exaggerating the extent of Bitcoin’s energy consumption? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "text": "\n This weekend two exchanges have released details on how they will handle the November 15 Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork if there happens to be a blockchain split. The exchange Coinex and the trading platform Bitasiaex have informed their customers how they intend to deal with the upcoming consensus changes.\nAlso Read: New Satoshi Challenger Tells All — But Is He Legit?\nExchanges Begin to Announce Fork Plans\nTwo exchanges have announced their plans concerning the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork planned for November 15. Over the past few weeks BCH proponents, developers, and miners have been discussing the fork coming up, but there’s been a disagreement over the changes. The Bitcoin ABC development team has a different hard fork plan than Nchain’s new client Bitcoin SV. Essentially if hash power decided to choose both versions there could be some incompatibilities and a blockchain split with no replay protection. However, some members of the community wholeheartedly believe there won’t be a split, some believe there will and one chain will die off rather quickly, and others think things could end up like the Ethereum network fork, which also had no replay protection but both chains remained.\nCoinex: The First Exchange to Reveal Fork Contingency Plans   \nWith all that’s happening and even though the fork is still about two and half months away, two exchanges have come forward with their plans for the fork — Bitasiaex, and Coinex. The first exchange Coinex is often one of the largest bitcoin cash exchanges by volume because it offers BCH trading pairs and was launched by the firm Viabtc. Coinex says Nchain has recently announced the client Bitcoin SV and the exchange considers it an “altered version” of the Bitcoin Cash protocol. Following this statement, the firm explains it will do a snapshot of all BCH assets held on the trading platform on November 15 and everyone will get a 1:1 ratio if there is a split.\n“Bitcoin-SV (BSV) is the altered version of Bitcoin Cash protocols. BSV is likely to bring a potential fork of Bitcoin Cash by causing incompatibility with Bitcoin Cash network and therefore create a new cryptocurrency asset — Bitcoin-SV (Token: BSV),” the exchange states.  \n\nShould it happen, all Bitcoin Cash holders will then receive BSV assets against a 1:1 ratio on your BCH assets.   \n\nCoinex says the company is a “responsible cryptocurrency trading platform” and has to take some precautions before the fork. Much like with previous forks, Coinex explains what the management team will do going forward, however emphasizes the firm, it “will not support BSV deposit and withdrawal until its chain is stabilized and all supporting services e.g. wallet are available.” In addition to this statement, the company promises to protect assets with the help from the mining pool Viabtc. Coinex states:      \n\nTogether with ViaBTC mining pool, CoinEx will guard your assets even if there’s no replay protection.\n\nBitasiaex Will Give the Chain With the Most Work the BCH Ticker\nThe following day on September 2 the trading platform Bitasiaex also announced its plans for the November fork. According to the exchange, there are a lot of development teams coding for BCH – such as BU, XT, and ABC – and they also welcome new teams like SV. As of right now, they have not heard any known team intending to fork the chain. \n“For controversial escalation of agreements, Bitasiaex recommends that the community work closely for suitable resolutions, such as miner vote for each individual upgrade items, rather than a direct fork once disagree with each other,” explains the exchange’s statement. \n\nBitasiaex remains neutral and has no intention to inﬂuence this matter. Bitasiaex will monitor the situation very closely, if there is a fork happening come November, Bitasiaex will be well prepared, and all BCH holders will receive new forked coin with corresponding amounts.\n\nIn regards to the BCH ticker the trading platform explains that a branch with replay protection will be renamed and this will be followed by the “most chain work principal for BCH, the most chain work since August 1st, 2017 will be entitled the name BCH.”\nNchain CEO: ‘The Winning Chain Will Compete for Votes Under Nakamoto Consensus’\nBoth Coingeek and Nchain have made statements concerning the Coinex announcement in particular. In regard to the exchange calling Bitcoin SV an “altered version” of BCH, the firm Coingeek believes Coinex should define the Bitcoin ABC client in the same manner. The reason the firm believes this is because the ABC client also introduces “an altered set of protocols,” according to a recent Coingeek article. Then on Sunday Nchain’s CEO, Jimmy Nguyen, detailed to his Twitter followers that new client has no intentions of creating a new coin.   \n“Bitcoin SV does not intend to fork off from BCH nor create a new coin/token — Instead, the Bitcoin SV node provides a clear BCH implementation choice for miners who support Bitcoin’s original vision — It will compete for miner votes under Nakamoto consensus to be winning BCH chain,” Nguyen notes. \nWhat do you think about exchanges advising their customers now before the upgrade approaches?

    "text": "\n Supermarket chain Walmart is selling candy bitcoins, at least according to a photo posted in crypto forums. A dollar will get you half a dozen in a bag under the “Everyday Low Price” banner. “The modern currency in chocolate!” hits store shelves in the U.S. while the retail giant files another blockchain-related patent, this time for a delivery system with drones and robots programmed to use distributed ledger technology.  \nAlso read: Russians Design а ‘Beautiful’ Mining Rig\nChocolate Bitcoins in Walmart Stores\nLike many other serious businesses nowadays, we’ve heard from Walmart some ambitious plans for blockchain implementation. Cryptocurrency, however, is a whole other story for many of these corporations, and the U.S.-based retail behemoth is no exception. The “technology behind it” is what most of them are fascinated with. The digital, decentralized money is not on the agenda, for now.\nWell, it’s sweet to see bitcoin, which has been the subject of so much hype and attention in the past year, finding its way to store shelves. Not in the pricing of goods, not as a payment option in this case, not yet, but as the new item in the cornucopia of products. Bitcoin is now reportedly entering Walmart stores in America in the form of candy. Sweet, indeed.\n\nThe chocolate bitcoins are delivered by the Frankford Candy & Chocolate Company, the Pennsylvania-based candy manufacturer. A photograph posted in the r/cryptocurrency forum on Reddit shows Bitcoin branded boxes of chocolate coins under the well-known “Everyday Low Price” advertisement. And for most of this year’s bear market, the slogan sounded spot on for the real bitcoin as well.\nThe Frankford Bitcoins are packaged in mesh bags containing 1.48 Oz of milk chocolate wrapped in tinfoil, according to Walmart’s website. Six of those should cost you as little as $1 USD. That’s an exchange rate the crypto community hasn’t seen in a while (God forbid), despite this year’s steep slump in the price of BTC, the coin with the largest market cap, from its December all-time highs of almost $20,000 to below 6,000 this summer. Unfortunately, as it sometimes happens with products in high demand or of strong appeal, the chocolate coins are currently unavailable for shipping or pickup. Let’s hope it’s just a temporary shortage.\nWalmart Files Another Blockchain Patent\nThe candy bitcoins appeared just as the retail chain applied for another patent related to the implementation of the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. The documents filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) detail a blockchain-based, automated system for delivery of goods and services to customers. It’s supposed to use drones and robots which can autonomously authenticate each other. The “Systems, Devices and Methods for In-Field Authenticating of Autonomous Robots” patent describes a process of authentication using data stored on a distributed ledger.\nIn the last couple of years, Walmart has filed several patents pertaining to different applications of the blockchain technology. Its efforts are mainly aimed at maintaining the company’s positions against strong competitors from the e-commerce sector, but not only. In 2016, Walmart announced an initiative to improve food safety by utilizing blockchain tech to provide better food tracking and consumer safety. The project was launched in collaboration with IBM and Tsinghua University. In June of this year, the retailer won a patent for a system to house medical records on a blockchain.\nWalmart Inc. is one of the largest companies with almost 12,000 stores in 28 countries around the globe. With over 2.3 million employees, it’s also the biggest private employer in the world. The multinational retail corporation operates a chain of hypermarkets, department and grocery stores, and is arguably the largest company by revenue.\nDo you think products like the chocolate bitcoins can increase the interest in cryptocurrencies?

Bitwise Index Services, a subsidiary of Bitwise Asset Management, has announced the launch of three new indexes covering the mid-cap, small-cap, and total-market segments of the crypto market, as well as the renaming of its HOLD 10 Index as the 10 Large Cap Crypto Index.\nAlso Read: The Daily: Stoners Drop Crypto From IPO, Binance Launches Academy\nThree New Cryptocurrency Market Index Funds\nThe launch and rebranding of HOLD 10 means that company’s cryptocurrency index roaster now features four options for investors to choose from: 10 Large Cap Crypto Index (ticker: BITX); 20 Mid Cap Crypto Index (ticker: BITW20); 70 Small Cap Crypto Index (ticker: BITW70); and 100 Total Market Crypto Index (ticker: BITW100).

    "text": "\n August is not the best period for important decisions but it seems a good time to sketch plans for the second active half of the year. Authorities in several countries have shared their intentions regarding the regulation and oversight of the crypto space. The club of crypto-friendly jurisdictions may accept new members this fall. Others may take a different route, at least for now.  \nAlso read: Malta Tops Exchange-Based Crypto Trade, Russia Leads in OTC Volume\nUkraine to Take Example from Switzerland, Malta, Gibraltar\nKiev, which has postponed the adoption of crypto regulations for some time, has indicated its decision to follow the examples set by crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Switzerland, Malta, and Gibraltar. That’s according to comments made by Timur Khromaev, head of the country’s National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC).\nUkraine needs a law in order to become a leader in creating conditions for the development of the crypto market, he said, quoted by local and Russian media. Khromaev also believes that cryptocurrency is a financial instrument, before anything else, and insists that it should not be viewed as a means of payment. This presumption is a corner stone of the new regulatory concept adopted recently by Ukraine’s Financial Stability Council of which the NSSMC is a member. The high-ranking Ukrainian official also stated:\n\nWe plan to legally recognize cryptocurrencies as a financial assets and allow people to invest and use these financial instruments.\n\nThe next step, Khromaev added, will be to implement a mechanism for taxation and define the regulatory responsibilities of relevant government institutions. According to the NSSMC’s president, the new legislation, which is currently being developed in cooperation with Ukrainian deputies and representatives of the industry, is expected to be adopted by the end of the year or in early 2019.\nNew Russian Crypto Law Coming Soon, Official Says\nAccording to Elina Sidorenko, head of the interdepartmental group assessing the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, the revamped Russian crypto legislation, which “takes into account earlier remarks, as well as the interests of the business and the financial regulators,” will be presented in the near future. The new draft will list “the rights, duties and responsibilities of participants in crypto-relations,” Sidorenko wrote in her Telegram channel.\nIn May, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, the State Duma, adopted three crypto bills on first reading – “On Digital Financial Assets,” “On Attracting Investments Using Investment Platforms,” and “On Digital Rights.” Deputies then attempted to synchronize the texts, taking out terms like “digital money” but keeping legal definitions such as “digital financial assets” and “digital rights.” The second and third reading of the bills were supposed to take place before July 1, as President Putin had ordered, but they were postponed for the new parliamentary session in September.\nLatvia to Adopt a Law for Cryptocurrency Taxation\nEarlier this year, Latvian authorities announced they were considering the possibility to recognize cryptocurrency as a means of exchange in order to impose tax on capital gains from crypto deals. Now, according to local media reports, the government in Riga wants to accomplish this through new legislation and the Latvian Ministry of Finance is preparing a draft law that’s supposed to be ready by December. The bill should determine the taxation procedures applicable to incomes of individuals from transactions with virtual money, including cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\nAlexander Kitchenko, member of the Latvian Bitcoin Foundation, revealed details about the proposed tax mechanism in conversation with the local outlet Baltnews.lv. Authorities, he said, intend to collect taxpayers’ data from crypto trading platforms. The monitoring will be performed on the entrance and exit of the crypto space, where corporate entities act like intermediaries for crypto-fiat transactions. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will most likely be taxed as digital property, the expert elaborated.\nHungary Mulls Crypto Regulations and Taxation\nAuthorities in Budapest are considering and drafting regulations for the crypto sector in Hungary. Representatives of the central bank, the finance ministry, the tax service, and other government institutions have formed a working group tasked to assess the legal, economic, security and other aspects of cryptocurrencies, Hungarian media reported.\nThe Ministry of Finance, quoted by the local financial outlet Portfolio, reminded Hungarians that cryptocurrencies are not yet accepted as legal means of payment in the country. They do not qualify as legal tender, electronic cash, financial instrument, or cash equivalent, the ministry emphasized.\nNevertheless, local crypto investors are expected to pay taxes on their incomes from dealings in cryptocurrency even under the current legislation. Profits from crypto transactions are classified as “other income” on tax returns which means 15% tax is due, as well as 22% in the form of health insurance contributions. Legal entities are obliged to pay the treasury 9% income tax and 2% corporate tax.\nKazakhstan to Follow in the Footsteps of Belarus\nKazakhstan, the Central Asian powerhouse which has been wandering for some time between two extremes – banning cryptocurrencies and supporting crypto development – may eventually implement a Belarus style solution. The Astana International Financial Center (AIFC), which was launched with the goal to turn the country into a regional financial hub, has put forward draft regulations that will place the oversight of cryptos and token sales under its control. That’s a much more crypto-friendly scenario than the alternative of letting the central bank be the main regulator. The National Bank of Kazakhstan has previously called for the prohibition of crypto transactions, exchange, and business.\nThe legal amendments are designed to facilitate investors, private individuals and corporate entities that want to work with cryptocurrencies in the AIFC, Forbes Kazakhstan reports. They envisage the classification of cryptocurrencies within the national legislation and the adoption of mechanisms to regulate and license the operators of cryptocurrency exchanges. Rules and regulations for crowdfunding through initial coin offerings (ICOs) and the use of smart contracts are also included in the proposed legal framework.\nWhat are your thoughts on these regulatory developments?

But it’s safer and easier to do this through QR code because you don’t have to give your credit card numbers. […] The merchants save money in America by paying with bitcoin, because they pay 1% of the transaction fee, but with credit cards, that’s 4%. So the merchants can make a lot of money if you are paying with bitcoin. But yet they don’t understand it, they have to be educated about it. And the consumers have to get the habit of spending with bitcoin. For them, it’s better and quicker than credit cards, and better for privacy,” he stated.\nMr. Singh added that the typical American cryptocurrency-user is principally concerned with speculation rather than the utility of bitcoin, stating: “A lot of people in America have heard of bitcoin, but not a lot of them own bitcoin. Even the tech people and college kids bought bitcoin, they’ll not spend it. They bought it only for speculation. And if you ask them about bitcoin, they can tell you about the price but nothing else, because they treat it as an investment tool. We need to get these people to actually start to spend bitcoin.”\nAsian Region a Key Market for Bitpay\nThe Bitpay CCO indicated that Asia comprises the company’s major market, stating “I have to say that Asia is a very big market for Bitpay and for bitcoin overall. And it will be that way for a long time, not just for trading, but for businesses as well. If you [live] in China or Korea and you have to pay an invoice to America, let’s say a million dollars, and you use bank services, it’ll take you 3 to 5 days for that payment to happen and it cost 3% to 4% in fees. We can do the whole thing in one day for 1% fee by bitcoin. That’s how bitcoin solves a real pain point. It’s cheaper and quicker than bank wire in most regions of the world.”\nMr. Singh also expressed his confidence that bitcoin “will become a main street product in the next couple of years,” adding “It just takes a little time.”\nDo you think that bitcoin fulfills its utility as a means of exchange?

    "text": "\n The Philippine SEC (Security and Exchange Commission) approved draft rules for initial coin offerings (ICOs), ABS CBN News reported. This official approval will pave the way for the legal sale of cryptocurrencies in the Philippines. The Securities and Exchange Commission has released, for public comment, the proposed rules to govern the registration of initial coin offerings, which will be considered when the actual rules will be implemented, SEC Chairman Emilio Aquino said.\nAlso read: Philippine SEC to Develop Cryptocurrency Regulations\nAll Entities Embarking on ICOs to Register With the SEC First\nIn February, news.Bitcoin.com reported that the Philippine SEC was developing a regulatory framework to govern cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the financial regulator emphasized the need for legislation focused on ICOs in particular. SEC Chairman Emilio Aquino told reporters on August 2, in Manila, regulations will be set for the sale of tokens or cryptocurrencies issued by companies for the purpose of raising funds, the news wire reported.\n\nThe SEC stated 12 points in the proposed rules released on August 2. “Under the draft rules, the tokens issued by the startups or companies conducting the ICO may follow the nature of a security under Section 3.1 of the Securities Regulation Code, and therefore, these should be registered with the Commission and necessary disclosures need to be made for the protection of the investing public.” The SEC press release mentioned.\nStudy of the white papers of various ICOs that have been conducted within the Philippines shows that the proponents of such ICOs claim that the tokens being issued are not securities and are therefore not under the jurisdiction of the SEC, the regulator said.  “Allowing this practice is proven dangerous to the investing public who are left with no clear recourse once the said ICOs are proven to be scams. Therefore, the SEC will put the burden of proving that the tokens issued through an ICO in the hands of the proponents by presuming that the tokens are securities unless proven otherwise,” the SEC stated in a press release. “The proposed rules are benchmarked from the rules in various jurisdictions and markets,” it concluded. \n“The bottom line is we are looking at whether we would allow retail investors to participate,” Emilio Aquino told reporters on July 30. He also said the SEC requires all entities embarking on ICOs to register with the SEC first, the Philippine Star reported.\nAquino, who was appointed in June, is facing a new regulatory environment with the proliferation of cryptocurrencies, the newspaper outlined. But as former commissioner, he has been at the forefront of the SEC’s crackdown on investment scams. Aquino said the principle of scamming always involves the promise of investment returns that are too good to be true. In tightening the rules on ICOs, the SEC determined that cryptocurrencies are securities because they include an investment contract whereby a person invests his money and is led to expect profits.\nWhat do you think of the Philippine SEC draft rules on crypto?

    "text": "\n A Hong Kong-based investment firm is planning to launch a new crypto-custody service to address the growing interest from institutional clients, and we’ve covered the story in today’s Bitcoin in Brief. Also in The Daily, billionaire Mike Novogratz expects an influx of institutional investors into the crypto space; a new survey claims 30 percent of Brazilians want to invest in cryptocurrency; and an Australian startup shows what to do with excess tokens if the sale did not meet its target; Samsung stores in the Baltic states don’t accept crypto after all, Coppay explains why.\n Also read: TCAP Explores Market, Tutanota Accepts Cryptos, Huobi Launches Cloud\nHong Kong Investment Firm to Launch Crypto Vault\nResponding to increasing interest in cryptocurrencies from high-net-worth and institutional clients, a Hong Kong-based company is planning to launch a crypto-custody service by the end of this year. Fusang Investment Office is an asset manager focused on Asian private family offices. Its Fusang Vault is expected to open for customers in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n“Digital assets are akin to bearer bonds, whereby whoever that is holding the security is presumed to be the owner and there is no registration of ownership information of the security. Hence, the way we keep digital asset secured is of paramount importance,” said CEO Henry Chong, quoted by the South China Morning Post.\nChong did not provide more details about the Fusang Vault’s services. However, he shared that Fusang Investment is already working with insurers to provide cybersecurity insurance coverage for future clients’ digital assets. SCMP’s report also notes that cryptocurrency trading is attracting more and more financial institutions like hedge funds and asset managing firms. This leads to an increasing number of over-the-counter (OTC) transactions and creates the need for alternative asset safekeeping options.\nNovogratz Expects a ‘Herd of Institutional Investors’ in Crypto\nMichael Novogratz\nProminent hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz expects more financial institutions coming into the crypto space. A “herd of institutional investors” is headed towards cryptocurrencies, Novogratz said in a speech during the Blockchain Week Korea last week. In an interview with The Street, he added: “I think institutional investors are slowly coming to the realization that blockchain will be Internet or Web 3.0 and they’ll want to participate just like they want to participate in the Web.”\nNovogratz, who earlier this year raised $250 million to launch Galaxy, a merchant bank trading cryptocurrencies, and invest in blockchain projects, also said that institutional investors will first participate through venture-capital funds. “Many of them are already participating because they’ve invested in Sequoia or Polychain or Benchmark or many of the other VC funds that invest in this area,” he added. According to the billionaire investor, the second step for these players will be to buy coins or even acquire ICOs.\nA Third of Brazilians Interested in Crypto Investments\nAmid rising popularity of cryptocurrencies around the world, a new study reveals that about 30 percent of Brazilians are interested or intend to invest funds in cryptocurrencies sometime in the near future. The survey, carried out by cybersecurity firm Avast, also found that more than 84 percent of the 1,900 people polled were aware of and familiar with cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe results published by the local crypto outlet Portal Do Bitcoin also show that 44 percent of respondents agreed to websites using their computing power to mine cryptocurrencies in exchange for an ads-free surfing experience. At the same time, more than 86 percent of the surveyed admitted they were concerned about their devices being infected with mining malware. Half of the rest believed they would not be affected because they did not own any cryptos.\nAustralian Startup Bitcar Burns Its Unsold Tokens\nA company building a platform to support crypto payments for fractional ownership of collectible car brands has decided to demonstrate what a startup could do when its initial coin offering did not attract as much capital as expected. Bitcar launched its ICO last year hoping to raise $25 million at the start of 2018. Investors were offered to buy the BITCAR tokens that would allow them to pay for a share of a luxury vehicle. The firm wanted to buy the cars on their behalf with the intention to hold them for around 15 years, until they appreciate enough to be sold for profit.\nThe Australian startup, which was set up in Singapore where regulations are more favorable, managed to collect $S6.5 million (~$4.7 million USD) during the presale of its token and $S3 million (~2.2$ million USD) in the public sale later, bringing the total to $S9.5 million (~$6.9 million USD), or less than half of the stated target, Business Insider Australia reports. One token was worth US10c at the time but it’s currently trading for less than a cent.\nThe smaller amount of capital raised has forced Bitcar’s team to reassess the situation. The startup has decided to essentially get rid of the excess tokens in hope to improve the scarcity of those already sold. “Due to the smaller raise, Bitcar have decided to burn unsold tokens from the ICO –– thus reducing the circulating and total supply,” the company explained. The startup’s founders also announced they plan to “burn” half of their allocated tokens.\nSamsung Stores in the Baltics Don’t Accept Crypto, Coppay Explains Why\nCoppay, a European crypto payment processor, announced last week that Samsung stores in the Baltic States will be accepting seven cryptocurrencies through its payment gateways. Following the announcement, a Samsung spokesperson was quoted in some reports explaining that the corporation is not partnering with Coppay. The fintech firm denied the reports and provided in a new blog post its explanation about the situation after the original release was deleted.\nIn the update, Coppay clarifies that it has offered its solution to the Baltic premium reseller of Samsung products, which is a separate entity. The company signed an agreement with the reseller, activated its payment gates in the stores and even trained personnel there. Coppay CEO Ina Samovich emphasized: “We’ve never claimed that we enter into partnership with Samsung HQ. We announced about the possibility to buy Samsung products with cryptocurrencies in its Baltic stores.”\n“Unfortunately, after Samsung officially announced that it doesn’t have any plans for the crypto and blockchain payments, the reseller decided to suspend [the] cryptocurrency payment method,” the blog post details. The company also says it has the evidence to prove its version of the chain of events and has uploaded a photo of a Coppay sticker with a sign saying “cryptocurrency accepted here” in what appears to be a Samsung branded store.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s news tidbits?

    "text": "\n In today’s Bitcoin in Brief we mention some optimistic mid to long term predictions for crypto markets. And while decentralized currencies are hurting in a bearish month, the prospects for state-issued virtual money look even dimmer. Another senior Swiss central banker has noted the diminishing enthusiasm of governments to mint digital coins. Venezuela gives an example – Caracas has recently fired the nation’s crypto superintendent, reportedly for failing to raise billions through Maduro’s favorite El Petro.  \nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief: Plagiary, Numerology, and Nano Does a No-No\nBottom Line: Bitcoin Will Recover\nIt takes a lot of optimism to make bullish predictions at a moment like this, but if it’s a relatively long term prognosis for growth, preceded by a short term one for further drop, then it does sound like a safe bet. Todd Gordon, founder of Tradinganalysis.com, is one of those analysts who believe the bottom line is that Bitcoin will eventually recover, by early 2019 to be precise.\n“I did expect Bitcoin to drop, I thought for a long time we’re going to drop below $5,000,” Gordon told CNBC. He actually expects BTC prices to decrease a little more than that but he is also positive that the market will turn somewhere in the $3,000 to $4,000 range. “I think by the time this contest is over in February, we’ll be well back above $10,000 and in a pretty good shape,” he added.\n\nAccording to Todd Gordon, the correction we have seen from $19,000 down, in terms of percentage drop, is “inconsequential,” and “very much expected,” compared to the gains since 2015, when Bitcoin took about a 78 percent hit in the aftermath of the Mt. Gox hack. “Right now we are about two thirds of the way through that equal correction,” he said.\nGordon noted that his prediction is based on a “beautiful uptrend” on a percent change chart. “You can’t look on bitcoin on a traditional, linear, arithmetic chart,” he warned. The expert emphasized that the current 17 percent average weekly high-to-low range is the “lowest bitcoin is ever seen,” as the movement has reached 30-40 percent at times in the past. “If I am down 30 percent on bitcoin in this contest, that’s nothing – it can make that up in two weeks,” the analyst added.\nOthers Like the $10,000 Mark Too\nOther members of the crypto space have made similar predictions about the mid-term prospects for bitcoin. At the end of May, blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart said he expected the price of BTC to rise again above $10,000 per coin by the end of 2018, noting that the cryptocurrency is still worth buying, despite its continued losses.\n“In the past, when the value of BTC dropped by 50 or 60 percent, a cloud of fear used to develop and people seriously questioned if bitcoin was over,” Bogart told CNBC. However, he highlighted a key difference between today and the crashes of the past – the exponential amount of development and adoption we have seen since those times. Bogart, a partner ат Blockchain Capital, also noted that most coins are overvalued in comparison with bitcoin. He advised investors to sell cryptos like cardano, tron, IOTA and NEO, but stressed they should hold cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash (BCH), ethereum, ripple, and EOS.\nMost cryptocurrencies saw losses of up to 20 percent over a 24-hour period yesterday. Many observes attributed the latest dump to the recent measures taken by Japan’s financial regulator. The Financial Services Agency issued six new business improvement orders to crypto exchanges Bitflyer, Tech Bureau, Bitpoint Japan, Btcbox, Bitbank, and Quoine. In recent weeks markets have been also reacting to a number of negative events such as the hacks of Korean exchanges Coinrail and Bithumb, as well as the exposure of scams and suspected market manipulations.\nEnthusiasm for State-Backed Cryptos Dying Out\nCountries are unlikely to issue national cryptocurrencies any time soon, according to a high ranking representative of the Swiss National Bank’s management. Central banks around the world have become skeptical of introducing state-backed digital currencies, Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board of SBN, told Business Insider.\n“In the beginning, there was a lot of interest and enthusiasm about issuing their own national cryptocurrency but I think, in the meantime, that enthusiasm has slowed again because of the implications it would have for financial stability,” Moser explained. Nevertheless, he said he would not be surprised if national cryptocurrencies emerged in the longer term but noted that currently everyone is waiting for someone else to do it first.\n\nThomas Moser thinks that to some extent it makes sense to have an electronic version of the banknote but warned the implications are substantial. “The advantages are relatively small but the unknown risks are potentially large so I think the balance is to be cautious.”\nMoser’s comments reflect the position of another senior representative of Schweizerische Nationalbank. In April, Andrea Maechler, member of its governing board, stated that “private-sector digital currencies” are better and less risky than any version offered by a central bank. A government-backed coin “would deliver scarcely any advantages, but would give rise to incalculable risks,” she warned, noting that it would make it easier for people to withdraw money if they felt a bank was in trouble.\nVenezuela’s Crypto Superintendent Reportedly Fired\nCarlos Vargas, Venezuela’s Superintendent of Cryptocurrency, has recently left his post. Some local media reported that actually he has been fired by President Maduro after his team failed to deliver on the promises to raise billions through the initial coin offering of the national oil-backed cryptocurrency, the Petro.\nAccording to a publication by Caracas Chronicles, only 2,266 petros have been transferred so far on the distributed ledger that tracks their movement. Even if all of them were sold at $60 per coin, the outlet speculates, the government has raised no more than $136,000. That’s way below the once promised $5 billion.\nVery little is known about the new superintendent, Jocelit Ramírez, and his team. He is believed to be very close to Vice President Tareck El Aissami.\nDespite threats by officials to restrict decentralized cryptocurrencies and crack down on exchanges, Venezuelan bitcoin trade on platforms like Localbitcoins has spiked in recent months, largely due to the unattractiveness of the hyperinflated national fiat, the bolivar. The socialist government in Caracas has had hard time convincing its partners to accept the petro in bilateral trade. Several weeks ago, India rejected Maduro’s proposal to buy Venezuelan oil at discounted petro prices.\nWhat are your expectations for the future of decentralized cryptocurrencies and state-issued digital coins?

    "text": "\n Yukio Noguchi, a famous economist in Japan and an advisor to Waseda University’s Business and Finance Research Center argues we can’t expect Bitcoin’s prices to rapidly surge again. In his books and in recent articles, Noguchi makes his case eloquently. He wrote a recent article in Diamond Weekly clarifying his position but has been making his case since January of this year and published a book last December.\nAlso read: The Daily: Analysts Predict Bitcoin Will Rebound, Enthusiasm for State Coins Lost\n“Because It’s Now Possible to Trade on Bitcoin Futures You’ll Never See a Rapid Surge Again”\nNoguchi points out that the price of BTC is now almost a third of what it was in December of last year. He believes that because it’s now possible to trade on Bitcoin futures people will never see a rapid surge again. \nOn one hand, he says that because the price of bitcoin has gone down, the costs of sending bitcoin are now back to a level that makes it cheaper than doing bank transactions and this is welcome.\nBitcoin won’t surge, Japanese economist says\nHe argues that the introduction of the futures market has driven down the price considerably. This year in January he persuasively argued that the cause of Bitcoin price collapse was the start of the selling of bitcoin futures. “Bitcoin prices were a bubble, to begin with, and now we’re seeing a return to normal values. The San Francisco Federal Bank, in a report, also suggested that the introduction of Bitcoin futures trading caused a price drop. \nAdditionally, the market is heading towards a situation in which it will be possible to short-sell bitcoin futures and that will also contribute to keeping the prices down. \nNoguchi points to a paper published on May 7 by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, “How Futures Trading Changed Bitcoin Prices“, authored by Galina Hale, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Marianna Kudlyak, and Patrick Shultz. Here is the key passage:\n“From Bitcoin’s inception in 2009 through mid-2017, its price remained under US$4,000. In the second half of 2017, it climbed dramatically to nearly US $20,000, but descended rapidly starting in mid-December. The peak price coincided with the introduction of bitcoin futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. Rather, it is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset.”\nWaseda University, Japan\nNoguchi insists that actually, the majority of investors are predicting that prices of bitcoin will continue to fall, especially when some are able to make money from short-selling the cryptocurrency. \nHe also feels that allowing cryptocurrency to branch off, it makes people feel like they can get new cryptocurrency for free and that also drives down price.\nDoes he see that as resulting in a decline in the popularity of Bitcoin? \nSurprisingly, Noguchi believes it’s a good thing. As the price of bitcoin drops, it becomes a more attractive means of sending money. He calculated that at current prices, if you had to use Mitsubishi UFJ Bank to send money, it costs you 432 yen for any amount above 30,000 yen. But with the current value of Bitcoin, it’s cheaper to send via a regular bank transfer than BTC, unless the value of BTC falls to 675,000 yen. When BTC returns to that level, it will finally be trading at what should be a normal value. \nOn December 20th last year, Noguchi’s book, “An Introduction To Bitcoin And Blockchain” was published and received rave reviews.\nWhat do you think of Prof. Noguchi’s analysis on Bitcoin surge?

    "text": "\n Just recently, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the trustless betting concept called Chainbet designed by the Electron Cash lead developer Jonald Fyookball. Since then, Chris Pacia performed the first atomic bet on the Bitcoin Cash network and now the project is seeing contributions from other developers as well. Now the programmers have revealed they have developed a working prototype that executes BCH wagers in a decentralized and trustless fashion.\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency Firm Circle Sees Institutional Interest Spike 30%\nChainbet Developers Produce a Working Prototype\nThe protocol Chainbet is moving along as the project has moved from Jonald Fyookball’s proof-of-concept into a reality as the developer has revealed a working prototype. In essence, Chainbet allows two parties (Alice & Bob) to bet in a completely trustless manner without the need for third-party arbitration and all of it is recorded on-chain using bitcoin cash. During the first week of June, Fyookball told the Bitcoin Cash community about his new idea while also launching Chainbet’s Github repository that explains the concept in better detail alongside the codebase. Openbazaar developer Chris Pacia took the project a step further performing the first atomic bet on the BCH chain. Following this, Fyookball, Pacia, and James Cramer boosted the project even more by adding the ability to not only perform simple coin flip bets, but also auctions, multiplayer bets, and six-sided dice rolls.\n\nNow the project is really moving along, according to Fyookball, as the developers have devised a working prototype and the reference implementation was built with the open source SDK Bitbox. The Chainbet developers have also released a video of the prototype in action which shows a wager taking place between two candidates in a decentralized manner. According to a source familiar with the development team, the protocol could add a lot more on-chain transactions on the BCH chain. \n“Each bet is around 10 on-chain transactions — Once it goes live it should increase transaction count quite a bit,” our source details.\n\nChainbet Goes Beyond Provably Fair \nFollowing the announcement of a working prototype and a video showing the action in process, a Lightning Network supporter claimed on Reddit that there was a “better solution to betting in a provably fair model that scales efficiently working right now” and shared an app called ‘Lightningspin.’\nThe Electron Cash developer and creator of Chainbet Jonald Fyookball scoffed at the LN supporter’s assumption that the ‘Lightningspin’ app is a ‘better solution.’ \n\nChainbet goes beyond provably fair — It is also trustless.\n\n\nSince the inception of Chainbet, the recently re-enabled OP_Codes, and increased OP_Return data field things like on-chain trustless wagers are becoming a reality. The idea shows that decentralized bets used in various ways on gambling websites like Satoshi Dice, Bitcoin Cash Games, and other BCH casinos could create trustless environment for their visiting players. Essentially, wagers like these could revolutionize the way we gamble online. \nCheck out the prototype video below.\n\nWhat do you think about the Chainbet technology moving forward?

Purse says they have completed a major overhaul of the entire Purse experience, including a redesigned wallet that helps reduce fees.\n“Our community has demanded more cryptocurrency choice and this is our first big step. To celebrate, we’ve partnered with the Bitcoin Cash Fund to rain cash on you all,” explains Jaqi Lenee the company’s product design leader.\n\nWe’ve built support for Bitcoin Cash [BCH], which is a great option for people who want to save more dough. Transaction fees on this network are currently cheaper and less volatile. Shoppers, simply fill your wallet with Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash and start shopping. Earners, you’ll be able to pick which coin you’d like to earn before accepting an order. Choose wisely. (Or flip a coin?)    \n\n\nThe Purse and Bitcoin Cash Fund Cashback Promotion \nThe ‘Cashback’ contest will offer $10 cash back for 1,000 shoppers until the end of July and $850 in prizes for top earners, explains Purse. Based on the number of BCH orders accounted for within that time period, there will be a 1st place reward for $500, 2nd place ($250), and 3rd place ($100). Purse details that the Cashback promotion will distribute contest rewards after deliveries are confirmed.\n\nBitcoin Cash fans were excited to see that BCH is now integrated into Purse.io and even posted on some of the purchases they have been making since the launch. One Reddit user writes, “Just made my first purchase.

    "text": "\n Just recently the notorious libertarian and Austrian economist, Ron Paul, released a paper that discusses the world’s issues with central economic planning. In the report, Paul goes into vast detail on how precious metals and cryptocurrencies can co-exist in order to prevent current market monopolies from “rigging the economy.”\nAlso Read: US Authorities Seize Over $20M in Crypto in Massive Darknet Crackdown\nRon Paul: “Ultimately, the Market Proves More Powerful Than Government Manipulation of Economic Events”\nRon Paul is a very popular libertarian that ran for the U.S. presidency a few times, but he has always proposed some contrarian opinions unlike any other politician today. For instance, Paul constantly tells the American public that they should “end the Federal Reserve,” or at the very least audit the private bank and find out how it has been operating over the years. Furthermore, Paul fundamentally believes our money should revert back to the ‘Gold Standard,’ and feels it is “a fallacy to believe the U.S. has a free market economy.” Paul’s unique libertarian teachings have inspired a great number of people to embrace free-market economics and question the current way governments operate.\nIn Paul’s latest paper, The Dollar Dilemma, he details just how bad the monetary system is today, and explains how precious metals and cryptocurrencies can co-exist to help fight against the decaying global economy.   \n“The economy is run by a conglomerate of individuals and special interests, in and out of government, including the ‘Deep State,’ which controls central economic planning,” explains Paul’s paper.\n\nRigging the economy is required to prevent market forces from demanding a halt to the mistakes that planners continuously make — This deceptive policy can last only for a limited time — Ultimately, the market proves more powerful than government manipulation of economic events.\n\n\nCryptocurrencies & Gold: A Combination of the Old and New Monetary Practices\nPaul further asks whether or not precious metals will serve as a better system for the future or if it will be the concept of cryptocurrencies. He believes the proper way to assess the situation is to make certain that “free people in the marketplace make the choice whether the use cryptos, absent the dictates of government and central banks.” Paul emphasizes the process “requires the rejection of the use of force and fraud for any chance of achieving success.” In order for cryptocurrencies to challenge the history of precious metal acceptance it will take a “significant amount of time to reach consensus,” explains the former U.S. senator.\n“The marketplace is quite capable of sorting out the advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrencies and precious metals. The biggest challenge will be to get the government out of the way to allow this choice,” Pauls paper details. “It’s conceivable that cryptocurrencies, using blockchain technology, and a gold standard could exist together, rather than posing an either-or choice — Different currencies may be used for certain transactions for efficiency reasons.”\n\nThe desire for storage and speed can make a difference in choosing a currency. It appears that decentralized ledger technology will also be useful outside the sphere of digital currencies. A combination of gold and crypto will prove to be a lot more achievable than getting people to adapt to a totally new concept of money.\n\n“A Modern Day Currency Needs an Enlightened Attitude About What the Proper Role for Government Ought to Be in a Civil Society”\nThe paper further states that each type of money may serve different needs and cryptocurrencies may be able to help with privacy, especially when it involves larger transactions and settlement across greater distances. Paul says the biggest challenge right now for digital currencies is satisfying the prerequisites of a ‘standard unit of account.’ In Paul’s view, a workable currency must keep the public confident and the monetary unit needs to be easily exchanged and hold reliable “real value.”\n\n“For society to advance to the point of accepting a truly denationalized monetary system, a significant amount of energy will be required to rein in the power of government authoritarians — A modern-day currency needs an enlightened attitude about what the proper role for government ought to be in a civil society,” Paul’s paper reveals. “We can use technical science for advancing civilization, but no one can ‘own’ it — As valuable as wheel technology was, no one ever bought and sold this technology as a piece of property.”\n\nThe question that can only be answered by the marketplace is whether or not blockchain technology is just another great scientific breakthrough, or can it, in combination with cryptography, become a functional currency? The basic question boils down to this: Do all new currencies need to be based on something tangible?\n\nThe full transcript of Ron Paul’s paper The Dollar Dilemma can be found here on Mises.org.\nWhat do you think about Ron Paul’s latest paper about precious metals and cryptocurrencies co-existing while the dollar self-destructs?

    "text": "\n A recent report published by the European Parliament advises policymakers and regulators not to ignore cryptocurrencies or attempt to ban them. It discusses how crypto should be treated, their taxation, as well as their potential impact on financial systems and central banks’ monopolies on money issuance.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space\nEuropean Parliament’s In-Depth Analysis\nThe European Parliament last week published an in-depth analysis entitled “Virtual currencies and central banks monetary policy: challenges ahead.”\nThe 33-page document was provided by Policy Department A at the request of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. It is co-authored by Marek Dabrowski and Lukasz Janikowski.\nThe report acknowledges that virtual currencies (VCs) “are often referred to as ‘cryptocurrencies’ because the majority of VCs rely extensively on use of cryptographic algorithms.” However, the authors of the paper wrote, “in our opinion, this term is misleading and may have a pejorative meaning, so we will not use it in our paper.” The document specifically defines VCs as private money that is usually decentralized, exists exclusively in digital form, most are based on blockchain technology, and most have global character meaning they work across national borders.\nThe report reads:\n\nPolicy makers and regulators should not ignore VCs, nor should they attempt to ban them. Both extreme approaches are incorrect.\n\nThe authors further asserted, “VCs should be treated by regulators as any other financial instrument, proportionally to their market importance, complexity, and associated risks…Given their global, trans-border character, it is recommended to harmonize such regulations across jurisdictions.” In addition, they recommend that investment in cryptocurrencies be taxed similarly to investment in other financial assets.\nImpact on Financial Systems\nThe report discusses the potential impact of cryptocurrencies on financial systems as well as whether they can break central banks’ monopolies on money issuance.\nAfter analyzing the impact of cryptocurrencies on monetary policy, the authors concluded that it seems unlikely that cryptocurrency has the potential to compete with the sovereign currencies issued by central banks, “despite the relative market success of bitcoin and the chances for similar successes with its followers.”\nCiting that the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies in April was below US$300 billion while broad money (M3) in the US approached US$14 trillion at the end of 2017, the report states:\n\nThe monetary dominance of major central banks and major currencies seems to remain unchallenged in the near future.\n\nWalking a Thin Line\nNonetheless, the authors believe that “the prospects may look different in smaller monetary jurisdictions, especially in countries where the sovereign currency remains inconvertible or does not enjoy the trust of economic agents due to its poor record of stability or due to political and economic uncertainty.”\nThe report also finds that the demand for cryptocurrencies is not going away and that it should be taken seriously by all readers. “The economists who attempt to dismiss the justifications for and importance of VCs, considering them…frauds or simply as a convenient instrument for money laundering, are mistaken. VCs respond to real market demand and, most likely, will remain with us for a while.” It also concedes that:\n\nIn extreme cases, such as during periods of hyperinflation, financial crisis, political turmoil, or war, they can become a means of currency substitution in individual economies.\n\nMeanwhile, the authors reiterated their opinion that cryptocurrencies pose little threat to the existing central banks. “Despite their technological advances and global reach,” cryptocurrencies are “far from being able to challenge the dominant position of sovereign currencies and the monetary policies of central banks, especially in major currency areas,” they conveyed. In the document’s summary they even hinted at a specific way to keep cryptocurrencies from becoming a more useful money:\n\nAs long as major trading platforms and financial intermediaries do not accept payments in VCs, their transactional role will remain limited and they will fulfil mainly the third function of money, the store of value —that is, they will serve as one of many investment assets.\n\nWhat do you think of the European Parliament’s findings and recommendations?

    "text": "\n It’s been a good week for bitcoin (BTC), which is up 8%. But you wouldn’t think so to read the news. Alight on one of several mainstream media (MSM) outlets and you might have learned that bitcoin is crashing and on its way to zero. Taking cheap shots at bitcoin is great for attracting rage clicks. It’s also a great way to look foolish.\nAlso read: Unaware Where Bitcoins Are Mined, RBZ Governor Embraces Blockchain\nMSM Floats a Sea of FUD\nBitcoin has now died 319 times according to Bitcoin Obituaries, but like a B-movie zombie it just won’t stay down. To date, no one has succeeded in administering the fatal double tap, and not for lack of trying. Nine years on, bitcoin is stronger and healthier than ever, with a thriving ecosystem of projects under development, from sidechains to custodial and layer two scaling solutions. \nOnly the brave or the foolish would write off bitcoin in 2018, and yet that’s exactly what so-called experts keep doing. “I thought we’d finally get rid of bitcoin,” grumbled John Crudele in the New York Post. He’s been banging the same drum for four years. “But the fake “currency,” which I like to call bitcon, just won’t fade away…Even at $6,600, bitcoin is still worth 70 percent less than it was at the beginning of the year.” He finished:\n\nI use the term “worth” cautiously because bitcoin is really worth nothing, since it’s backed by nothing or no one. It’s a confidence game that has value only because people are convincing other people that it’s worth something. Got it! Ponzi scheme. Confidence game. Fraud. Anyway, bitcoin is headed for a value of zilch. It’s only a matter of when.\n\n\nThe Lost Art of Googling\nBitcoin isn’t complicated. Merkle roots and block header pruning and UTXOs, sure, that stuff’s too complicated for your average MSM journo. But understanding bitcoin at its most basic level requires nothing more than an ability to Google. Another serving of FUD this week came from a research paper that the Bank of Finland released.  The Great Illusion of Cryptocurrencies includes such observations as “cryptocurrencies are not real currencies but instead accounting systems for non-existent assets” and “For all intents and purposes, that ledger is a centralised ledger. The fact that there are multiple synchronised copies of it, distributed across a network, is irrelevant, as each one has the same data.”\n\nThe UK Media Weigh In\nAround the same time that the New York Post’s Crudele was foaming over his laptop, British tabloid The Sun was also doling out misinformation. “BUBBLE TROUBLE How Bitcoin bubble burst as cryptocurrency loses 70% value and 800 digital currencies now defunct” screeched the headline. “FEARS are growing that the cyptocurrency [sic] bubble is about to burst after it emerged more than 800 digital coins are now defunct,” read the article, conflating dead shitcoins with BTC for no apparent reason. \nThe Independent is meant to be more reputable than The Sun, but the British media outlet also took aim at bitcoin this week. Like The Sun, its analysis was hopelessly off the mark. “Bitcoin has fallen to its lowest point since November and will probably be totally wiped out” ran the headline by associate editor Hamish McRae, “one of the country’s most respected financial journalists and commentators”. Evidently in the mood for serving some WTF with his FUD, McRae’s byline read: “Will investors’ support for bitcoin continue? The trouble is that we don’t know who owns it. A huge amount of energy has gone into uncovering ownership but most names remain concealed.” Somewhere in the midst of the rambling screed, the journalist then floated the idea that “By looking at IP addresses, it is clear that [bitcoin] ownership is very concentrated.”\n\nThe Independent’s financial expert ended: “The BIS [Bank for International Settlements] thinks that the decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies is a weakness rather than a strength.” Well fancy that. “My instinct is that these cryptocurrencies will disappear in a puff of smoke. I just hope too many people are not too damaged when it happens.” The thing about predicting bitcoin to go to zero is you can never be proven wrong. You can also never be taken seriously again.\nWhat other MSM publications don’t understand bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below. Images courtesy of Shutterstock.
