    "text": "Today, In Bitcoin We Trust, a virtual currency exchange, launched. In Bitcoin We Trust (IBWT)will initially be working with Bitcoin, potentially expanding to encompass Litecoin and other viable digital currencies as time goes on. This UK based exchange will accept GBP to date and plans on expanding to accept euros. As one of the first UK exchanges, IBWT will plan on taking a wait and see approach to how the US market develops before getting involved in USD.IBWT serves as the United Kingdom’s only virtual currency exchanged solely handling Bitcoin. Fully verified services currently only available to UK residents and individuals with a UK bank account. IBWT has capped customer account and withdrawal/deposit limits at £1,000. After some time the IBWT team plans to expand customer account limits. While currently having one tier of customers, IBWT hopes to expand tiers to allow for higher value deposits and withdrawals. While gradually increasing customer account and withdrawal limits, IBWT plans to strategically grow as one of the first British cryptocurrency exchanges.IBWT uses the Faster Payments system within the UK, allowing wire transfers (deposits/withdrawals), once cleared, to be processed within 2 hours, excluding weekends. Additionally, to protect the privacy of customers, unverified customers can use almost all services, deposit/withdraw bitcoins and trade on the trading platform. Verified customers can also deposit and withdraw fiat GDP.Currently, IBWT is not governed by HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customers) or FCA (Financial Conduct Authority, recently known as the FSA, Financial Services Authority). However IBWT leadership plans on adhering to any regulatory changes required by the UK government. Working to improve the visibility and credibility of cryptocurrencies and non traditional exchanges, IBWT plans on providing an example of how an exchange can operate within the regulatory framework of the United Kingdom. IBWT will establish a business network of exchanges to further build confidence in cryptocurrency exchanges in the UK and around the world.The IBWT team intends to provide a more secure platform for transacting Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies. Security is ensured with Cold Storage, SSL 256-bit encryption & 2FA. In particular IBWT uses a method of enforced (email ToTP) Two Factor Authentication for user account to login to ibwt.co.uk. IBWT customers can also set an extra layer of security, (google authenticator) Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP) for login, withdrawal/deposits and settings.In addition to serving as a secure exchange, IBWT will work to provide top customer service. To maintain profitability of their site, IBWT will charge only 0.8 per transaction. To avoid a lengthy approval process, IBWT is committed to a simple verification process, meaning one can become a full customer in a matter of days. With a dedicated server for an enhanced customer experience, IBWT hopes to build up customer trust and serve as a convenient yet secure exchange. All deposits and withdrawals run through wire transfers and while services are only available to UK residents to date, IBWT plans on expanding its user base.As the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem is only as strong as an active userbase, IBWT aims to encourage financial participation in the UK and around the world. With a new Bitcoin and cryptocurrency related exchange in the UK, IBWT will promote cooperative business practices with traditional and non-traditional banks. Bitcoin Magazine encourages readers in the UK to check out In Bitcoin We Trust. Please visit the IBWT exchange or the IBWT Facebook Page for further information and updates.",

    "title": "The fourth largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, BitFloor, has announced that it is closing its doors, and will soon",
    "text": "The fourth largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, BitFloor, has announced that it is closing its doors, and will soon be refunding deposits to customers. The announcement has nothing to do with recent technical problems that all exchanges have been facing for the past week to due the sudden massive increase in trade volume; rather, the root cause behind the shutdown is the closure of BitFloor’s US bank account. Founder Roman Shtylman writes:I am sorry to announce that due to circumstances outside of our control BitFloor must cease all trading operations indefinitely. Unfortunately, our US bank account is scheduled to be closed and we can no longer provide the same level of USD deposits and withdrawals as we have in the past. As such, I have made the decision to halt operations and return all funds. Over the next days we will be working with all clients to ensure that everyone receives their funds. Please be patient as we process your request.– Romanfounder – bitfloor.comTrading has been suspended, and BitFloor founder Roman Shtylman assures users that they will get all of their current deposits back over the next few days, including USD holdings which will be refunded directly to depositors’ bank accounts by ACH transfer. International users are asked to await further instructions.The exchange was a very popular way of buying bitcoins in the United States, so BitFloor customers will now have to look for alternatives. Some BitFloor users will undoubtedly be picked up by the dominant exchange MtGox through its North American partner Coinlab, although other options include Coinbase, CampBX and BTC-e.Particularly affected by the shutdown are those users who had lost their deposits when the exchange was hacked in September. BitFloor lost $250,000 from the hack, normally a fatal loss for an exchange of its size, but BitFloor soon came back online with the promise that it would eventually pay back its depositors over time. The exchange even started fulfilling its promise, paying back 1.7 of the money owed in November and another 1 in March, but the remainder of the debt remains unpaid, and although most people had already written off the loss in September, there is now no longer any hope at all that the money will ever be recovered.The announcement is also an unfortunate one because it represents a step backwards in the progress of the exchange industry as a whole. BitFloor is far from the first Bitcoin exchange to fall victim to this kind of shutdown; many Bitcoin exchanges around the world, including several times even MtGox, have had their bank accounts shut down, although in MtGox’s case the exchange’s main bank account in Japan has remained unscathed. The number of shutdowns has waned in recent months, but the risk has remained as risk for every exchange in the industry since exchanges first began to appear en masse in 2011. Now, when the need for more exchanges is clearer than ever, a reinforced precedent of banks shutting down smaller exchanges may instead push more users to larger and generally more resilient exchanges like MtGox out of fear for the safety of their funds. Fortunately, today exchanges do place much more emphasis on maintaining a healthy relationship with their banks and ensuring legality, and new alternatives are constantly appearing. Tradehill intends to launch a new, high-quality Bitcoin exchange soon, the cash-based Bitcoin ATM continues to be under development as a completely fresh alternative, and we can be sure that there are other projects now under development. Although Bitfloor will certainly be missed, hopefully it will soon find an even better replacement.",

    "title": "There is a new wallet that has surfaced recently that allows users to send Bitcoin and many other digital currencies",
    "text": "There is a new wallet that has surfaced recently that allows users to send Bitcoin and many other digital currencies by using a web address. This new service, bitcoinwallet.com, gives users the ability to personalize their payment address in a manner similar to a Tumblr or hosted web address. The Bitcoin Wallet platform makes sending and receiving payment as easy as exchanging names. For example, if John Smith used this platform, he could share the address “johnsmith.bitcoinwallet.com.” This would allow John to send and receive payments to anyone who uses the service.Bitcoin Wallet was started by Alex Charfen, entrepreneur and CEO of Charfen Institute. Recently, Charfen released an article which showed his staunch support of Bitcoin. By using examples from current and past technology and innovation to reinforce his points, his writing is one of the strongest endorsements of Bitcoin thus far. His investment in Bitcoin and its technology led to the creation of this new wallet service. Charfen states in the article, “Bitcoinwallet.com is our contribution to this passionate community and through the technology and ease of use we have created, our submission to the community at large that we may solidify our approval and inclusion.”Bitcoinwallet.com supports Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Quark, Megacoin and Peercoin. When you create an account, an official address is assigned to you, giving users the ability to send Bitcoin to your official address. Users can also list other addresses for Bitcoin and supported cryptocurrencies as external addresses, meaning that when a user visits your profile they will see all your addresses, and they can send payment in the currency of their choice.According to the site, users can also receive free Bitcoin for signing up for an account or referring a friend. Furthermore, there are daily, weekly and monthly giveaways that all users are eligible for.What about security?In regards to the security of funds, Bitcoinwallet.com uses two-factor authentication for every user who signs up. The wallet service also states that a majority of funds will be stored in cold storage wallets, which are not accessible via any system, with only 6 stored in hot wallets according to the company’s news page. They maintain systems with SHA-2 SLL and AES user data encryption. For users worried if they are sending funds to the correct address, each profile states the sign-up email that was used when the profile was created. For example, users who want to send funds to the Red Cross will be able to see if they are sending to an official company (redcross.com) email address.Users are able to send other users coins for free, with a minimum user-to-user transaction size of one satoshi (.00000001BTC). Bitcoinwallet.com charges .0008BTC to cover cost of service and miner fees for blockchain deposits and withdrawals the minimum transaction amount is .001BTC. To clarify, Bitcoinwallet.com is not an exchange. Instead, it is a means for user-to-user transactions without fees or confirmation delays.The company is also planning to release a crowdfunding feature to allow users to create and manage crowdsourced funds, and will also be releasing support for other languages after the initial beta period.",

    "text": "African Bitcoin startup BitPesa launched its remittance service in Tanzania today. The service previously was available only in Kenya, where the company is headquartered. It hopes to undercut the fees charged by incumbents’ remittance services.BitPesa launched its international money transfer in Kenya last year with the goal of expanding the service to the rest of Africa, something the company has slowly been working toward. Besides its remittance product, the company operates an exchange in Kenya and Ghana but Tanzania is the first country the startup has expanded its international money transfer service into.Like Kenya, Tanzania is a mobile money hotspot and an ideal country for BitPesa. The nation has a population of more than 43 million people, and, according to a2014 study by industry group Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA), has 31.8 million registered mobile money accounts. Tanzania received $317 million in remittances, $15 million of which came from Kenya, in 2012, according to a World Bank study.BitPesa’s service allows anyone to send money to any Tanzanian phone number and charges a flat 3 percent on all its transfers. The service also promises the money will arrive instantly.A Competitive MarketBitPesa will be joining a number of other companies that offer domestic (from city to rural) and international remittances in the country. Tanzania already has more than six mobile money operators who offer money transfer services to anyone in the country, and operators such as M-Pesa, who have partnered with Western Union, offer international mobile remittances.Due to a lack of studies and research about remittance fees in Tanzania, it is unclear whether BitPesa will have a cost advantage, but it is certainly likely, especially for inter-Africa remittances. A 2013 World Bank press release said that Tanzania, alongside South Africa and Ghana, were the most expensive African countries to remit money to. Fees reportedly could get as high as 20 percent.BitPesa’s low flat rate might turn out be an attractive option for Tanzanians in Kenya remitting money back home, which is a smaller corridor and usually has higher fees. The same might hold true for Tanzanians living in Uganda when the Bitcoin startup expands there later this year. The service will of course allow people from anywhere in the world (excluding the United States) to remit money to the small African country as well.A more likely candidate for the service however, are businesses operating in Kenya, Tanzania and countries such as the United Kingdom, who have to send money to and from the African nation. BitPesa has already pivoted their service to better accommodate businesses’ needs after finding a large interest in the service from the group late last year.Image via BitPesa.co.",

    "text": "Abine announced the release of Bitcoin Anywhere, a new service that lets users spend bitcoin at all online merchants that accept MasterCard. The service, currently in an invite-only beta, permits funding of a Blur “Masked Card” from a Coinbase wallet.Currently, Bitcoin Anywhere is available only to invited users of Abine’s Blur premium service.Blur Masked Cards are one-time MasterCards created on-the-fly by Abine, which can be used at all online merchants that accept MasterCard, which, in practice, means all online merchants. Masked cards don’t compromise the user’s real name and address and have a built-in limit to avoid hidden charges.“When a user makes a Masked Card, we are issuing a limited-balance, limited-duration credit card for that transaction. When you generate a masked card we charge your funding source,” said Andrew Sudbury, Abine co-founder and CTO.Bitcoin Anywhere aims to make bitcoin payments widespread by automatically signing up all online merchants. Only the users know that they are paying with bitcoin, whereas the merchants continue to use their credit card payment systems.The Abine announcement notes that leading venture capitalists invest in the Bitcoin ecosystem because they are persuaded that more consumers will use Bitcoin if it is accepted more broadly, while Bitcoin companies bet on wide acceptance catalyzing mainstream use.“What we aim to achieve is to assess consumer demand for a purchasing experience that balances innovation, convenience, compliance and security,” said Sudbury. Abine plans to share the results of the beta program with other Bitcoin companies and interest groups.Abine is a Boston-based company founded by Rob Shavell, Andrew Sudbury and Eugene Kuznetsov, focused on developing easy-to-use privacy solutions for consumers. Blur, the flagship service of Abine, is an integrated solution for privacy and online life management.Besides masked cards, Blur offers password management, online forms auto-fill, and one-time disposable email addresses. The premium service costs $39 per year (with discounts for multi-year subscriptions), and includes extra features such as data synchronization across multiple devices, secure backup and a masked phone number.With Bitcoin Anywhere, Abine enters the Bitcoin ecosystem with the same emphasis on privacy and ease-of-use.In related news, Australian Bitcoin company CoinJar announced the public launch of the Bitcoin debit card CoinJar Swipe. The card permits spending bitcoin anywhere that accepts EFTPOS. That means just about anywhere since the EFTPOS (Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale) payment network is widespread in Australia and New Zealand. The CoinJar announcement is titled “Now every Australian business accepts Bitcoin.”The card also permits withdrawing bitcoin as cash at any ATM in Australia.Abine and CoinJar are betting on expanding the adoption of Bitcoin by making the digital currency completely transparent to merchants. That seems to make sense, because acceptance by merchants is one of the critical bottlenecks in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Once consumers can spend their bitcoin anywhere, more people will participate in the emerging Bitcoin economy.Images via Abine.com",

    "text": "Amsterdam-based Bitcoin payment gateway Coinzone, which now positions itself as a full-stack Bitcoin solution with a focus on Europe, announced that it will launch its wallet – the core of its upcoming platform – in early summer.“Our goal is to assist Europe with all that Bitcoin has to offer the world of commerce,” says the Coinzone website.According to the company, the Coinzone Wallet will make Bitcoin simple for a growing community of European consumers. The fully-featured personal wallet will support country-specific local currencies for bank deposits and withdrawals, transfers and instant payments.“Growing European demand for Bitcoin means more and more consumers want a simple and secure way to transact,” says co-founder and CEO Manuel Heilmann. “We’ve developed Coinzone Wallet in response to an overwhelming demand from users seeking a wallet that stores their sensitive information locally in Europe.”The Coinzone wallet has been specifically developed to address privacy and legal frameworks, such as EU privacy, secure payment and data protection laws in operation across the region. All data will be securely hosted in European locations, giving Coinzone Wallet users the assurance of protection under European privacy laws.“Our aim is to make it easy for European consumers to do more with bitcoin,” added Heilmann. “The Coinzone Wallet is an important milestone for Coinzone towards a full-stack Bitcoin solution. It is set to literally get bitcoin into the hands of consumers so they can transact as and when they wish.”In a blog post titled “Why We’re Building a Bitcoin Wallet,” Heilmann noted that Coinzone always had more in mind than just building a payment gateway. Coinzone team members run studies to understand the various needs across Europe, and move from country to country to understand the local requirements of European bitcoin users.“We also hear over and over from consumers that is it too difficult to find places to spend bitcoin,” notes Heilmann’s post. “In every study we conduct at Coinzone, that is one of the top five questions people have. When you combine the rise in mobile usage with merchant adoption, we have an opportunity to create a new experience for consumers looking to spend their bitcoin. Our initial release of the Coinzone Wallet will make a step in that direction. Over time, we’ll continue to learn from feedback in order to enhance this feature.”According to Coinzone CMO and Vice President of User Experience Paul Sylling, we are moving into an era of “frictionless” spending based on mobile payments, in which consumers expect an experience that is easier and more convenient. Bitcoin matches perfectly with the rise of mobile and new expectations of how payments should work.“With the launch of the Coinzone Wallet, coupled with our existing merchant network, we position ourselves to reinvent the commerce experience,” Sylling told Bitcoin Magazine. “By building the full stack, we have the opportunity to offer additional unique services to our customers as well as streamline the user experience.”Sylling confirmed that according to current expectations, the Coinzone Wallet will be launched in early summer, and consumers can already sign up for early access. The wallet, available for Android, iOS and the Web, will include features deemed important for non-technical Bitcoin users, such as language localization, conversion to local currencies, and withdrawals to local banks.In order to address the problem mentioned by Heilmann – that it’s difficult to find places to spend bitcoin – the planned release includes map-based local search features. To merchants, Coinzone will offer point-of-sale (PoS) solutions to accept bitcoin payments on tablets and smartphones, and interfaces to existing payment processing systems.",

During that time, BitPagos CEO Sebastian Serraon told Coindesk, “You can go to any location, give them your account in Ripio and the amount of pesos you want to get in bitcoins. Boom: You have some bitcoins.”The acquisition of Unisend will allow the company to operate a fully operated bitcoin exchange on Gravel. “The big change is that … users of the platform will have a new online exchange market in Argentine pesos and bitcoins, connecting immediately offers for buyers and sellers,” the BitPagos team announced in a press release.BitPagos empowers small businesses and online merchants to process and facilitate simpler transactions internationally. The company believes that easy-to-use bitcoin exchange platforms could be the main factor that affects the growth of the Argentinian bitcoin industry.“The acquisition of Unisend and the integration of BitPagos onto the Unisend bitcoin exchange platform will result a significant increase in bitcoin transactions, promoting and strengthening the Latin American and Argentinian bitcoin network,” the BitPagos team announced.BitPagos raised $600,000 in a seed funding round led by Pantera Capital, Tim Draper, Barry Silber and Boost VC in 2014, to boost bitcoin use in South America. At the time, BitPagos processed around $150,000 per month on average. With the acquisition of Unisend, the company hopes to process around $1 million per month.",

    "text": "A stone’s throw from the New York Stock Exchange, in the heart of New York’s financial district, is a 6,000-square-foot facility called theNew York Bitcoin Center.The Bitcoin Center is known for educating the public on Bitcoin and crypto-economics at their events and inviting high-profile speakers. It has become a central part of the global Bitcoin movement in it’s own right and was recently featured on CNN in Morgan Spurlock’s Inside Man.This year, they are working on their new incubator.John Lilic, the Head of Investor Relations and Operations at the Bitcoin Center, spoke to me about the Bitcoin Center’s new direction.“We are very busy with our incubator and seed accelerator,” Lilic said. The Bitcoin Center has invested in a number of “exciting and compelling” tech startups working on blockchain innovations, he said.“We are uniquely positioned to observe the incredibly rapid growth of this sector. Smart money venture capital and Wall Street has already moved in to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollar, and this is just the very beginning,” Lilic said. “We are positioning ourselves by investing in our companies.”The Bitcoin Center is striving to be an industrious place with industrious developers, he said, adding that the Center has pivoted toward a more developer-centric space with a strong focus on its tech incubator.“We feel very good about the portfolio of companies we’ve got at the moment,” he said.Some of the startups Bitcoin Center has invested in include:Cryptos – A U.S.-based digital currency exchange powered by the AlphaPoint trading engine. It offers users access to deep liquidity and volume, leading-edge security and maximum performance.LiveryCab– LiveryCab’s system connects passengers to drivers by allowing passengers to enter their destination and drivers to bid on rides.Digital Asset Vending Enterprises (D.A.V.E) – A Bitcoin ATM, lightweight, secure, modular, open source and running as an Android app.Blockchain Apparatus – An incorruptible voting system designed on blockchain technology.An adage in the Bitcoin world is that innovation occurs at a much faster rate than in other industries. This holds true for the Bitcoin Center, as they begin kick-starting new businesses.In its first year, the Bitcoin Exchange hosted “every single important group or person in the Bitcoin world,” ranging from developers, corporate innovators and politicians to prominent nonprofit leaders, Lilic said. In its second year, it plans to expand operations by developing its portfolio of companies and “offering the market exciting opportunities.”“Our objective,” Lilic says, “is to continue to be a force for positive change and innovation in the new blockchain paradigm.”The doors at the Bitcoin Center are always open. Just go to 40 Broad Street.All photos courtesy of the Bitcoin Center.",

    "text": "\n Indonesia, trailing just behind the United States as the fourth most populous country in the world, has a large and growing bitcoin community. The vast population is 80 percent unbanked, and their Rupiah is one of the most-traded currencies for bitcoin worldwide already. Bitcoin.com interviewed Suasti Atmastuti Astaman, the Business Development Manager of Indonesian bitcoin exchange Bitcoin.co.id.\nAlso read: Here Are Bitcoin’s 8 Fastest Growing Markets \nMajority Market Share\nBitcoin.com (BC): What’s your market share of the Indonesian bitcoin market?\nBitcoin.co.id (BI): We have more than 229,500 members with daily growth around 100-150 members.\nOur daily transaction volume can reach up to 1.5 million USD per day. And we are listed as one of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges in Southeast Asia.\nI believe we control for more than 70% Bitcoin transaction in Indonesia, considering we are the biggest Bitcoin exchange in Indonesia.\nIndonesian Bitcoin Market\nBC: Can you describe the bitcoin market in Indonesia?\nBI: The majority of members in our Bitcoin exchange serve as Bitcoin traders, rather than Bitcoin users. They buy Bitcoin in intention to gain profit and use it whether for a short-term investment, a long-term one or perhaps both. They trade quite often, buying Bitcoin when the price is low, and selling it again when the price increases.\nThere are a lot of people in Indonesia that love to take profit from trading, not just cryptocurrency, but also stocks and foreign exchange. Apparently, they love Bitcoin just as much since the price tends to fluctuate a lot. For people who love the idea of Bitcoin as a new form of money, they are going to hate knowing that there a lot of people taking profit from Bitcoin trading but that’s the fact and it contributes quite a lot to our trading volume.\n\nOur daily trading volume usually reaches 5 to 10 billion Rupiahs when the Bitcoin price is stable, but the second it goes back to being volatile, we can process until 20 or even 25 billion Rupiahs per day.\n\nBut of course, there are also people who buy Bitcoin in order to shop (mostly online) or to make transactions in various MLM or money game websites.\nMain Uses of Bitcoin\nBC: What main uses of bitcoin are you seeing in Indonesia?\nBI: As I have mentioned before, it appears that there are more traders than actual Bitcoin users. It is not allowed for Indonesian people to pay for something within the country using any other currency other than Rupiah—not US Dollar, not Yen, and definitely not Bitcoin. But even so, Bitcoin merchants keep appearing in Indonesia and there are also a lot of our members that use Bitcoin to pay for Internet and electricity bills, top up their cellphones balance, book a plane ticket, etc.\nPersonally, as we are serving in a country where there are at least 80% of unbanked people in the market due to our vast region and there are more than 250 million people in term of population with remittance market cap reaching around 7 billion US dollar a year, it is only right if we try to use Bitcoin to support remittance services and make it easier, faster and cheaper for people to transfer money from anywhere around the world to Indonesia or vice versa.\n\nWe are serving in a country where there are at least 80% of unbanked people in the market.\n\nDigital cash such as Bitcoin will allow people to hold their own money without involving any third parties—this surely will make them interested in giving it a chance. I believe there will be a lot of people in Southeast Asia, where there are thousands of people working overseas and transferring money back home, who will find Bitcoin exciting and a great way to transfer money.\nRegulations\nBC: What does the Indonesian government say about bitcoin?\nBI: Other than giving an official statement about how they see Bitcoin, which you can see here, the Indonesian government hasn’t made any important moves to restrict or facilitate bitcoin transactions in Indonesia.\n\nWe are allowed to trade Bitcoin and treat it like a digital commodity, but they [the government] do encourage us to be careful toward it.\n\nSince Bitcoin is not treated as a currency, we cannot pay for something with Bitcoin in Indonesia (the government only allows Rupiah as a legal payment instrument in the country). This is why almost every merchant in Indonesia that accepts payments in Bitcoin, automatically converts the Bitcoins they receive into Rupiah and send the money into their bank account. This way, Bitcoin pretty much works like credit card and thus, does not violate the rules from government.\nWith no clear regulation, we’re operating as a marketplace that obeys the usual regulation regarding financial transactions in Indonesia which is collecting their ID, asking their sources of funds and the purpose of their transactions. We do this to comply with the KYC in order to prevent money laundering happening within the country using Bitcoin.\nFuture Adoption Prospect\nBC: How fast are you expecting bitcoin adoption to grow going forward?\nBI: With clear regulation, minimum amount of bad press, and huge effort in marketing? Soon, I guess. Even without those three, people are starting to love bitcoin more and more and treat it as a great way to invest. They start reading news about what’s happening around the cryptocurrency world in other countries, and there are a lot of positive news nowadays to keep Bitcoin interesting and people engaged.\n\nBy the end of this year, I predict there will be at least one million users in Indonesia with daily transaction volume reaching 3 million USD per day.\n\nWhat do you think of the Indonesian bitcoin market?

    "text": "\n Poland is one of the biggest bitcoin markets that gets the least amount of coverage in the English-speaking press, despite their currency typically ranking in the top-10 for bitcoin trades globally. Bitcoin.com interviewed Michal Dziedzic, Business Development Director for Bitmarket.pl, one of Poland’s largest bitcoin exchanges.\nAlso read: Polish Gov’t ‘Highly Interested’ in Bitcoin, Meets with Local Community \nBitmarket hosts around 45% of the daily volume of trades between bitcoin and the Polish Zloty. The exchange is run by the creators of the largest domain marketplace in Central Europe, AfterMarket.pl, and offers live Bitcoin and Litecoin trading, with margin trading up to x10. They also coordinate donation drives in bitcoin for charities and offer a daily price guessing jackpot game on their website.\nPolish Bitcoin Ecosystem\nBitcoin.com (BC): Can you describe the bitcoin ecosystem in Poland?\nMichal Dziedzic (MD): We have a small but great internal eco-system. We have merchants who accept payments; we have exchanges and a company (InPay.pl) which connect bitcoin users to merchants, allowing them to pay their bills using bitcoins. There are also some bitcoin miners here who have rigs over tens of MWatts power consumption.\nBC: Can you explain which is growing faster – bitcoin as a payment method or bitcoin as an investment?\nMD: The amount of merchants who are accepting bitcoin is slowly but steadily increasing in our country.\nOver the past few months the Polish Zloty has depreciated against currencies like USD or EUR, therefore, bitcoin has become a great store of value for some users and I think this was lately really important.\n\nOver the past few months the Polish Zloty has depreciated against currencies like USD or EUR therefore bitcoin has become a great store of value for some users\n\nThere is a big variety of the people who are interested in bitcoin as an investment – some of them are just buying them and keep “for a better time” and some are typical traders for whom bitcoin has become a way to earn money on a monthly basis. There is not really much of a difference if you compare our users to the rest of the world.\nLarge and Growing Market\nBC: Poland has long been one of the top-10 countries for bitcoin volumes worldwide. Can you describe how bitcoin adoption is coming along there?\nMD: Yes, it is true that the bitcoin scene in Poland is quite big if you compare the number of citizens to our volume.\nI believe that the main reason why not many foreign users had heard about us is that exchanges like Kraken or Bitstamp were created from beginning to operate in EUR or USD markets /BTC, but our main target has been the BTC/PLN (Polish Zloty) pair (obviously there is also additionally EUR/PLN). Nevertheless, some of our foreign customers (they use EUR) are happy with our service, the most being in PLN, and we hope that our growth in this sector will continue. One important thing is the EUR market has got a relevant depth to our main PLN market (we use FX transposition of PLN into EUR market).\nThe increase in bitcoin’s price is definitely helping – thanks to this we have a bigger attention of the media hence we begin to notice that more and more new users from Poland are making their first steps into the world of digital currencies and usually they start from registering on our exchange.\n\nThe FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) effect has an influence on many people therefore they want to know what a Bitcoin actually is.\n\nPersonally, I see a really huge difference if we go back in time. When I was starting my adventure with Bitcoin as a student a few years ago while writing my thesis about it not many people have heard about it – there was basically no media coverage at the time. Now the bitcoin community is much bigger and it is really easy to obtain information about digital currencies.\nAdoption Obstacles\nBC: What are the obstacles to bitcoin adoption there?\nMD: I think the obstacles are the same as in other countries. Lots of people basically don’t know what bitcoin is and they are afraid to use it. Sometimes media coverage is also negative – old convictions that bitcoin is being used for criminal activity and money laundry which were made a few years ago are still used even though a lot has changed over the past years.\nWe also hope that the banks will be more friendly when it comes to the partnership with bitcoin companies. The current policy of some Polish banks is to denounce the bank accounts agreements for businesses involved in the services for the cryptocurrency market. That’s why lately we have been forced to change the bank and the new system of bank accounts.\nRegulations\nBC: What does the Polish government say about bitcoin?\nMD: Bitcoin and other digital currencies have not been defined in our law system yet therefore sometimes it’s causing some issues when it comes to dealing with bitcoin on a large scale.\nWhat is promising is that our government wants to change things – we will see whether for better or worse but we believe that everything will be more transparent soon. In 2016 The Ministry of Digital Affairs became interested in Bitcoin – currently they are working with a group of blockchain/bitcoin companies & specialist (amongst them is our exchange). The goal is to properly legitimize and regulate bitcoin in order to improve bitcoin adoption in Poland.\n\nIn 2016 The Ministry of Digital Affairs became interested in Bitcoin.[…] The goal is to properly legitimize and regulate bitcoin in order to improve bitcoin adoption in Poland.\n\nFuture Outlook\nBC: How fast are you expecting Bitcoin adoption to grow going forward?\nMD: I would like to think that this is just the beginning of a great and long journey. Over the past years there has been a tremendous growth in bitcoin popularity – just look how many new bitcoin/blockchain companies have been created. If nothing bad happens and the governments see the potential of this technology, it’s safe to say that bitcoin’s future looks really promising.\nWhat do you think of the Polish bitcoin scene?

    "text": "\n Venezuela has been suffering from significant economic decline and turbulent markets. Many worldwide and residents of the region blame the country’s socialist government and centrally planned economic choices. Over the past few months, it’s been reported quite frequently that Venezuelan citizens have been finding financial relief by utilizing the decentralized cryptocurrency bitcoin.\nBitcoin.com decided to reach out to Jorge Farias from the bitcoin company Cryptobuyer.io and the consulting agency Coincox to confirm these stories. Farias details how economic hardships are affecting Venezuelan residents and lots of them are in fact utilizing bitcoin. Many Venezuelans are finding profits in bitcoin mining, using the currency to purchase food and medicine, and improving their lives greatly by giving residents the tool they need to overcome these economic afflictions.\nAlso read: Workers Who Travel Internationally Will Benefit from Bitcoin        \nVenezuelan Residents Find Financial Solace By Using Bitcoin \nJorge Farias of Cryptobuyer and Coincox\nBitcoin.com (BC): How did you hear about and get involved with Bitcoin?\nJorge Farias (JF): I got involved just after the first Bitcoin halving in 2013. I read the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper, and this was an epiphany. A new economic system with almost no limits had been born.\nBC: Can you tell our readers about Coincox.com?  \nJF: Coincox.com is the only Venezuelan blockchain consulting firm focused on companies and institutions interested in bolstering the technology to improve processes such as intellectual property registration. We are working on projects with two banks and two Law firms, and want to expand our operations in Latin America.\nBC: Can you tell us how Venezuela’s economic hardships are affecting the average citizen?\nJF: In many ways, not only the middle class, but all levels of the society are fighting against food shortages and rising crime rates. Currently, the government is deploying a system to control food delivery by using QR codes and fingerprint identification; this might be the final step to fully controlled communist state using technology.\nBC: The Venezuelan currency, the Bolivar, has lost significant value. Can you tell our readers about this?  \nJF: Venezuela has the record of the highest inflation rate in the world today. The national currency, the Bolivar, lost 20% in one day in December of 2016, after the government ordered the demonetization of the highest bill circulating.\n\nJust like India, there are long lines of people outside the central bank waiting hours to exchange their 100 Bolivar bills for a note, convertible in an undetermined future for news bills or a bank transfer, neither of these concepts have happened yet.\n\nBC: Are Venezuelans hearing about the benefits of Bitcoin within the region?\nJF: In the last few months the bitcoin community here is growing fast. There’s been a rise of the 450 % on searches of the word “Bitcoin” using Google. Localbitcoins operations have doubled in the last year, and our mainstream national media have published articles about the benefits of the underlying technology. For this reason, we launched Cryptobuyer.io, a digital assets platform that is for everyone, not just techies or bitcoiners. [It offers the opportunity] to buy and sell bitcoin using Bolivars.\nBitcoin’s Low Fees and Censorship Resistance Is Helping Latin America\nBC: Do you believe a digital asset like Bitcoin can help Venezuelans?\nJF: Of course, and it is happening. By utilizing Cryptobuyer and others platforms users in Venezuela are online freelancers and starting to accept bitcoin because it’s the only way to get paid without high fees, as most of them used Paypal before, but the money restrictions in Venezuela make it unusable.\n\nAlso, other users buy Amazon gift cards in the website using bitcoin to order food and medicine and send these goods to Venezuela using couriers services located in Miami, Florida.\n\nVenezuelan food shortages are affecting all residents within the country.\nBC: There have been some headlines about Venezuelans conducting Bitcoin mining operations. Can you tell our readers about this?\nJF: The electricity cost in Venezuela is subsidized by the state, and this makes more profitable such mining operations. Every day more people are buying miners to operate in the country, but the lack of regulations and sometimes the illegality of related imports are a barrier to starting this kind of business.\nBC: How do you feel about Venezuelan officials demonetizing its currency by removing certain bolivar denominations?  \nJF: It is like the government taking money out of your pocket, without any warning, clarification or substitution program. It is another way of social control.\nBitcoin Companies and ATMs Are Providing More Bitcoin Accessibility  \nBC: What are some ways Venezuelan citizens can obtain bitcoin in your country?\nJF: Cryptobuyer.io is designed to reach people with almost no knowledge about Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. It offers mobile phone top-ups, payments towards electricity and cable services, all using bitcoin. Also, our service offers remittance services using national bank transfers in Venezuela thanks to our partnership with a network of Bitcoin ATMs Worldwide.\n\nOne of the best use cases are within the Panama – Venezuela corridor: expats in Panama can send money using the ATMs from our local Partner Tigoctm.com from Cindy Zimmerman and Ira Miller, in minutes and cheap, to their families and friends.\n\nBC: Do you believe the country’s economic turmoil will someday be fixed?\nJF: Only with a government change or a social collapse. Venezuela gave birth to the greatest South American ever, the liberator of five nations, Simón Bolívar. I hope this gene in our collective biology can wake up and change the things for good, and soon. Thank you, Jorge, for taking the time to explain to our readers what is happening in Venezuela. We hope things change for the good as well and believe bitcoin will benefit citizens worldwide significantly.\nWhat do you think about Venezuelan residents turning to bitcoin to escape financial hardships?

    "text": "\n Bitcoin is becoming a world currency. Credibility and safe-haven currency functionality are some of the sine qua non features of a world currency. Signs corroborating that Bitcoin exhibits these two features are appearing more frequently and in ever more significant use-cases.\nAlso read: One of These 5 Hyperinflating Economies Could Adopt Bitcoin in 2017\nBitcoin is Gearing Up to be a World Reserve Currency\nThe People’s Bank of China\nRecently, The People’s Bank of China added to Bitcoin’s credibility by meeting with the executives of the largest Bitcoin exchange platform in China.\nIn effect, officials from The People’s Bank of China met with BTCC on January 6, 2017.\nThe purpose of the meeting was to “urge rational investment in Bitcoin,” Reuters reported.\nHowever, most importantly, the meeting demonstrated that authorities at The People’s Bank of China consider Bitcoin trading a proper business endeavor.\nCommenting on the BTCC-The People’s Bank of China meeting, a Reddit user, vapor114, wrote, “China just did BTC a favor in acknowledging that the exchanges are legitimate businesses that the gov’t recognizes.”\nMoreover, this was not the first time that BTCC met with bank authorities. A statement from BTCC reads, “BTCC regularly meets with the People’s Bank of China and we work closely with them to ensure that we are operating in accordance with the laws and regulations of China.”\nBitcoin is a Safe-Haven Currency\nPolicies on demonetization, signs of inflation, isolationist trends from the UK and the US, and the threat of trade wars with China and other big US business partners are just some of the factors that will test or are already testing Bitcoin’s capacity to function as a safe-haven currency.\nInvestors move to safe-haven currencies when they want to minimize the risk of losing wealth through the eroding effects of inflation and economic uncertainty.\nRecent events demonstrate that investors are using Bitcoin as a safe-haven in China. As we have seen, fluctuations of Bitcoin’s value are inversely related to the value of the yuan. Bitcoin has been surging as Chinese investors have been buying bitcoins to hedge against the declining yuan.\nOn the other hand, when the yuan soars, investors stop buying bitcoins. For example, this happened on January 5, 2017 and caused Bitcoin’s value to retrace over 20 percent from a three-year peak of $1,139.\nBitcoin is an Antidote for Countries Afflicted by Inflation\nSigns of inflation are showing up globally, fueling investors and businesses’ appetite for the cryptocurrency.\nArgentina has suffered from high inflation for decades; it was, not surprisingly, one of the earliest adopters of Bitcoin.\nNow, Venezuela is rapidly adopting Bitcoin. As a galloping inflation erodes the Bolivar, the cryptocurrency is coming to the rescue. For instance, a travel agency, Destinia, no longer accept Bolivars. Explicitly, a press release of December 23, 2016, states, “Destinia decides to operate exclusively in Bitcoins in Venezuela.”\nThe question now is what role Bitcoin will play if inflation shows up in the economies of developed countries, such as the US and Eurozone, where pressures to increase prices are also popping up.\nIn the US, the Federal Reserve acknowledges that inflation increased in 2016, although it is still below the Fed’s objective of 2 percent. Nevertheless, the Fed worries about inflationary pressures that policies from the upcoming administration could generate.\n“Asset price movements, as well as changes in the expected path for U.S. monetary policy beyond December, appeared to be driven largely by expectations of more expansionary fiscal policy in the aftermath of U.S. elections,” states the Fed Minutes of December 2016.\nSimilarly, in the Eurozone, inflation is increasing. The annual inflation rate reached 1.1 percent in December 2016, which represents an increase of 0.6 percent from November 2016, according to Eurostat. This rate of inflation is the highest since September 2013, reports CNBC.\nEconomies in Turmoil Increase Bitcoin’s Value\nIsolationism, demonetization, and political uncertainty are driving investors to buy bitcoins to shelter their wealth.\nFor example, Bitcoin’s value went up because of the uncertainty Brexit’s upheaval created.\nAdditionally, Fiat currency flaws have caused governments to demonetize their economies, which in turn, have triggered an increase in Bitcoin’s users as well as its Bitcoin value, as is the case in Venezuela and India.\nIndeed, as governments increase monetary restrictions, people use bitcoins to protect their capital and to move money across borders.\nIn this regard, Gil Luria, Director of Research at Wedbush Securities, told the New York Times, “The more there is an expectation for new barriers to be erected, the more there is an expectation that Bitcoin will be valuable for moving money across borders.”\nEach of these events strengthens Bitcoin’s path to prominence as a world currency. Additionally, as Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, predicts, “Bitcoin can serve as reserve for digital currencies globally.”  Moreover, says Lee, “Bitcoin’s blockchain can be the global anchor (proof-of-work chain) for all nationally created digital currencies.”\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin becoming a world currency?

    "text": "\n The past week in the cryptocurrency space has been interesting, to say the least. Since our last market update, many of the top digital assets including bitcoin have experienced a bearish downtrend. The significant dive had seen bitcoin hit a low of US$750 per BTC, but the price rebounded on January 12 with many of its altcoin peers following suit.\nAlso Read: Why Volume is Exploding at Mexican Exchange Bitso  \nBitcoin Bounces Back!\nAt the time of writing the fiat value of bitcoin is roughly holding above the $800 range after last weeks great climb to $1145. The price held steady above the $900 range just days before the dive, which many believe stemmed from China’s central bank inspecting bitcoin exchanges. The week-long inspection by the People’s Bank of China caused a lot of speculation and the price of bitcoin subsequently dropped significantly.\nCurrently, the inspections seem to be still happening, and changes have been made within Chinese bitcoin exchange operations. China’s top three exchanges Huobi, OKcoin, and BTCC have since changed their margin lending policies. It has been reported that BTCC and Huobi have ceased offering the service entirely while others have lowered borrowing limits significantly. Quite a lot of bitcoin community members have welcomed the changes saying that Chinese bitcoin trade volumes might be more accurate in the future.\nTop Market Trends in the Cryptocurrency Space \nIn the altcoin world, many of the top cryptocurrencies have also been finding new bottoms and bouncing back to new positions as well. The second highest token by capitalization Ethereum is currently up 3.2 percent with a price of $9.70 per Ether.\nRipple’s token has again remained steady this week at number three with little volatility at $0.0064 per XRP. The digital token price of XRP hasn’t had much of a relationship with the other cryptocurrency markets over the past two weeks.\nLitecoin holds the fourth position at the time of writing with close to a $200 million market capitalization. Currently, LTC is roughly $3.80 and seems to be following a similar course as bitcoin. Many are curious about Litecoin’s upcoming Segregated Witness implementation, as signaling will begin on January 28.\nThe privacy-centric cryptocurrency Monero has held significant value over the past two weeks and rests at $11.50 per XMR. Meanwhile, the notorious Ethereum Classic has managed to keep the sixth highest market cap staying above a dollar at $1.20 per ETC. Dash, Augur, and Maidsafecoin have had notable increases over the past 24-hours. Steem has finally lost its grip and has since been kicked from the top ten cryptocurrency market positions.\nCryptocurrency top ten markets into the second week of January.\nNotable Volume and Rebounds All Around \nCrypto-markets have been seeing quite a bit of volume over the past two weeks with bitcoin taking the lion’s share. However, Dash, Litecoin, and Monero have had sizable volume increases this past week as well. One notable mention this week is the anonymous cryptocurrency Zcoin which has increased in value over 81 percent in the past 24 hours. Attention has been mainly focused on bitcoin’s price within the cryptocurrency community and the recent PBOC inspections.\nOverall most cryptocurrencies are experiencing small and healthy upswings just like bitcoin. Traders have seemed to find their price floors with buying picking up and some starting to bet on long positions. At press time the price of bitcoin is slowly rising upwards with an average of $830 per BTC across global exchanges.\nWhat do you think of the current state of cryptocurrency markets at the moment?

    "text": "\n The U.S. Federal Reserve will not only issue its own cryptocurrency but will also make sure Americans use it. That’s the prediction of currency guru Doug Casey who has an uncanny record of being correct about economic and political trends. His latest book, Surviving Fedcoin: How to Protect Yourself (and Profit) from America’s Coming Currency Change, is a public bet that the U.S. government will issue its own bitcoin which Casey views as “the last arrow” in its money quiver.\nHow will the dynamic play out? He speculates, \n\n“To start with, I suspect it’s going to be a parallel currency. Perhaps usable just within the U.S. which, in effect, would be a form of foreign exchange controls even more effective than the inability of Americans to open up foreign bank and brokerage accounts today [due to monetary control through FATCA]…I think it’s a near certainty that they’re going to do something like this and soon.”\n\nAlso read: China to Play a ‘Leading Role’ in Bitcoin’s Future\nFedcoin\nFedcoin refers to cryptocurrency and/or protocol established by a central bank. National banks could forge their own ‘bitcoin’ with comparative ease and bitcoin consultants have sketched possible scenarios on how.\nIn “Some Thoughts on Fedcoin – a Fed backed cryptocurrency” (March 9, 2015),  Albert Szmigielski suggests, “[T]he Fed should premine all the currency that they want to issue on a blockchain….A premine happens where all (or part of) the cryptocurrency is issued in the first block, the genesis block. Then the Fed would just exchange the fedcoin for a dollar each.”\nIn the article entitled “Fedcoin” (October 19, 2014), J.P. Koning speculates, “The Fed would create a new blockchain called Fedcoin. Or it might create a Ripple style ledger by the same name. It doesn’t matter which. There would be an important difference between Fedcoin and more traditional cryptoledgers. One user—the Fed—would get special authority to create and destroy ledger entries….The Fed would…provide two-way physical convertibility between both of its existing liability types—paper money and electronic reserves—and Fedcoin at a rate of 1:1.”\nKoning draws upon the work of mathematician and economist Sina Motamedi for “a more technical explanation for how this would work in the case of a blockchain-style ledger.” Motamedi advises, “The simplest way for a central bank to create its own crypto-currency is for it to fork the Bitcoin protocol into a new protocol that is unchanged in every way except that, going forward, the central bank would set and adjust the block mining reward at its discretion…. [L]ike paper currency, the central bank’s crypto-currency would be both decentralized (in transaction) and centralized (in supply).”  \nDoug Casey\nDiscussions have been encouraged by the attention governments are directing toward Fedcoin. When the Bank of England released a paper (February 2015) that addressed the subject, the bitcoin-processing company Payment21 was not alone in asking, “Bank of England: Why might central banks issue digital currencies?”\nIn America, similar scenarios occur. In June 2016, central bankers from 90-some countries met behind closed doors in Washington D.C. and conferred with bitcoin experts. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen opened the conference, which included the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Bank for International Settlements.\nAdopting blockchain as a protocol to facilitate bank transfers was the focus but issuing ‘official’ digital currencies was actively explored. Adam Ludwin, CEO of the blockchain company Chain, delivered a speech entitled “Why Central Banks Will Issue Digital Currency.” Ludwin urged governmental attendees to use the revolutionary shift to create new assets for themselves.\n\n[T]he medium of money has only changed a few times in history, from precious metals to bearer currencies to now our ledger-based electronic systems. Bitcoin and blockchain represent a transition to a new medium. This transition is often referred to as distributed ledger technology….But I find it more helpful to look back to bearer instruments, like banknotes, to appreciate what this new medium enables: a digital bearer instrument.\n\nA key argument for Fedcoin is the perceived need to stabilize a cryptocurrency by pegging it to traditionally-issued money. The pegging would not necessarily be voluntary. Motamedi explains, “just like what happened with paper currencies, central banks will eventually step in to create their own crypto-currency protocols and forbid the use of any others. For simplicity, let’s call the central bank crypto-currency protocol BitDollar. Of course, these BitDollars would always be redeemable in regular dollars by the central bank, at least at first.”\nKoning is more blunt. “Now is the time for the rebels to figure out how to create a stable-price version of bitcoin, before Darth Vader does it himself. Otherwise they may someday find themselves closing down their bitcoin startups in order to write code for the Empire.”\nThe Why Of It According to Casey\nDoug Casey addresses America’s central banking system but the circumstances favoring a U.S. Fedcoin are mirrored throughout the Western world.\nHe doesn’t buy the stability theory. The U.S. government is bankrupt with liabilities far exceeding assets. Casey explains,\n\nSocial Security is bankrupt… Forty-seven percent of the people in this country are net recipients of money from the government… Officially, one-third of all the US government’s assets are student loans; little-known fact. About $1 trillion worth of them.\n\nThe greenback is semi-stabilized by being “the world’s money” but its privileged status is being shaken by nations such as China and Russia who aggressively seek alternative mediums for global commerce. Casey believes that yesterday’s monetary controls – quantitative easing and interest rates at near zero or below – cannot sustain a bankrupt dollar with waning global relevance. Yesterday’s methods are “going to come to an end….What can they [the feds] do?”\nWhat the feds can do is cryptocurrency; Fedcoin is what’s coming to a start. And, according to Casey, the primary benefit to government would be a centralization of supply and a transparency of demand (or transactions), which could centralize control of the economy to an unprecedented extent.\nWhy would people use the cryptocurrency? Fedcoin would almost certainly emerge as a parallel currency which would be adopted due to government requirements for its use in paying taxes or accessing entitlements such as Social Security. Increasingly, however, Fedcoin would become a tool to push toward a cashless society because physical money provides a privacy that prevents government control.\nCasey observes that the feds,\n\nlike to blame a lot of the problems on a lack of transparency, but with blockchain and the Fedcoin technology, they can see everything, everywhere. So it’s complete transparency ….Without cash, you have no privacy. If you have to put everything through a bank account, the government knows exactly what you’re buying, what you’re selling, how much you are earning. They’re in complete control; able to take what they want…including your entire account if you become politically undesirable.\n\nFedcoin would give the government God-like ability to track wealth. The justification will be to prevent criminal activities such as drug dealing and money laundering.\nWill the U.S. create a Fedcoin?\nCounter-arguments can be easily made; for example, most black or gray market activities are peaceful and not properly criminal. But Casey focuses on the harm inflicted on the prosperity and freedom of average people. “[P]eople that are dealing in what’s called the underground economy are actually providing useful goods and services,” he observes. “[I]f the government extracts its 30 or 40 percent in taxes, which they will be able to do now with Fedcoin, [that] is going to hurt the economy, not help it. It will help the U.S. government, but that’s different from the economy in America.” The government would grow richer.\nIt would also become a more powerful engine of social control. In terms of privacy, Fedcoin could become the anti-cash. “If I’ve got a $100 bill in my wallet or a bunch of 10s and 20s,” Casey explains, “I can spend them on anything I want with anybody I want and nobody knows. With blockchain….[the feds] know exactly who’s getting the money and what it’s being spent for. It can be programmed [perhaps through a mechanism simiar to smart contracts] so that certain transactions can’t take place….So you are pretty well blocked in.”\nFat people could be prevented from buying sugar; gun owners could be cut off from ammunition; teenagers could be banned from buying beer, cigarettes or video games. The possibilities seem almost infinite. In doing so, Fedcoin would merely extend existing policies under food stamp programs that prohibit spending on alcohol, casinos or strip clubs. The efficiency would be so much greater, however, that the difference of degree would become one of kind. The government could “prohibit anything without even passing a law….If your Fedcoin smartphone or chip isn’t programmed to let you buy that, how are you going to get it?” Politically controversial items, like a gun registry, could become irrelevant.\nOne of Casey’s dystopian predictions seems doubtful to me, however. It is the idea that many or most Americans would embrace being physically “chipped.” But, then, I may simply have more confidence in average people when it comes to recognizing their own self-interest.\nThe Shadow Of Solution?\nCasey likens the potential currency revolution to the Industrial Revolution. The technologies developed then gave unprecedented freedom and literally ‘life’ to the common man; the human life-span and population increased dramatically.\nBitcoin and blockchain are equally liberating to the individual but revolutionary technologies also challenge the status quo. And, so, entrenched powers attempt to co-opt their use.\nWhether governments will succeed is not clear; they may be thwarted by their own incompetence or by the intrinsic decentralization of cryptocurrencies. It seems clear, however, that governments will make the attempt. And when they do, the best response is a better technology that sprints forward and leaves those who wish to ‘tame’ it coughing on its dust.\nThose on the cutting edge of technology are today’s freedom fighters.\nWhat do you think about the U.S. government creating a ‘Fedcoin’?

    "text": "\n There’s a lot of changes happening with Chinese bitcoin exchanges lately in light of the recent central bank inspections. Last week the top three exchanges within the region drastically changed margin lending services. Now more revelations have come to light as these companies plan on charging their customers trading fees starting at the end of January.\nAlso read: Samourai Wallet Launches New Privacy Feature Ricochet\nNew Chinese Exchange Policies May Affect Markets\nIt seems after January 24, 2017, the top three Chinese bitcoin exchanges BTCC, OKcoin, and Huobi will be charging trading fees. The announcement comes after the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) began inspecting the exchanges and pledging new oversight. The most vocal company so far has been the BTCC exchange giving details to the public regularly.  \n“BTCChina, our CNY exchange, will start charging fees for bitcoin and litecoin trading from 12:00 PM (noon) UTC+8, Tuesday, January 24th,” explains BTCC during the recent trading fees announcement. “Market makers and takers will both be charged a flat fee of 0.2 percent per transaction. We are implementing fee-based trading to curb market manipulation and extreme volatility.”\nMany Bitcoin community members are wondering how these new policies will affect the Chinese trading market. The new rules have a stark contrast to the years when Chinese exchanges operated with no trading fees and significantly sized margin lending practices. While BTCC’s newly implemented fees are pretty low, a lot of people are welcoming these new changes to the Chinese Bitcoin markets. One commenter on Reddit declares, “We are now witnessing a historic moment in Bitcoin, the end of the China casino era.”\n\nCould Another Country Beat Chinese Volumes?\nThroughout the years China has dominated the trading market with vast volumes, but many questioned the numbers due to the exchanges lack of fees. With the new changes towards margin lending, and applying fees to trades, it may put China in a different position. Other countries are slowly rising to become the top dogs within the Bitcoin space.\nFor instance, Japanese trading volumes have exploded over the past few months as the country is now second in Bitcoin trading volume below China. Japan has focused steadily on capturing the Bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem and has definitely made its presence known over the past year. Companies like Bitflyer have positioned themselves as leading Bitcoin exchanges. Now the leading Japanese Internet company, GMO Internet Group is joining the Bitcoin exchange and wallet arena.\nIn Overcoming China’s Lead Trade Volume May Not Matter  \nChina has gained a noteworthy head start when it comes to the digital currency and blockchain industry. The country has dominated in transaction volume, trading volumes, mining pools, and the manufacturing of mining equipment.  Just one Chinese exchange has the lion’s share of the world’s Bitcoin trading volume compared to most global exchanges. However, some would tell you not to pay too much attention to Chinese trading volume as BTCC founder Bobby Lee once stated: \n\nThere is a lot of mining that goes on in China. However, I caution you: do not read too much into the high trading volumes. China has decent high volumes but unfortunately two of my competition exchanges — I never like saying this — but they are artificially inflating their volumes through the technique of wash trades. They use it for bragging purposes. They try to outdo each other. It’s not regulated yet so they don’t get slapped on the wrist for doing that.\n\nIt’s safe to say it will take some time before a serious contender comes into play. But it doesn’t mean China will dominate forever.\nWhat do you think about the recent Chinese Bitcoin exchanges’ policy changes? Let us know in the comments below.

    "text": "\n Just two short weeks after Barry Silbert filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), the Commission is now soliciting comments from interested persons regarding the proposed listing.\nAlso read: Needham: Probability of Approval for a Bitcoin ETF ‘Very Low’ \nSEC Soliciting Comments\nOn January 20, Barry Silbert filed a registration statement with the SEC to list his flagship investment product, the BIT, on the NYSE Arca exchange. The following week, the exchange promptly filed with the Commission proposing “to list and trade shares” of the BIT.\nThen, on Friday, the SEC published a notice “to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons”. The notice reads:\n\nInterested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act.\n\nComments may be submitted either online, by email, or on paper. File Number SR-NYSEArca-2017-06 must be referenced. All comments will be posted on the SEC website.\nThis is the second Bitcoin trust that seeks to list on the NYSE Arca. The first was SolidX Bitcoin Trust. According to the SEC, only seven comments were received for SolidX.\nHow Long Does the SEC Have?\nThe proposed rule change has not yet been published in the Federal Register, which is the next step of the process.\nThe SEC took two weeks to start soliciting comments for both SolidX and the BIT after their initial filings.\nFor SolidX, the Commission started soliciting comments on July 27, 2016, and published the proposed rule change less than a week later in the Federal Register on August 2, 2016. If SolidX is any indication, then the BIT’s proposed rule change should be published in the Federal Register sometime next week.\nAccording to the Commission, once published in the Federal Register, it will have 45 days from the date of publication, or up to 90 days if it finds a reason for the extension. By that time, the Commission will make a decision to either approve or disapprove the proposed rule change, or it will “institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved,” the SEC wrote about both the BIT and SolidX.\nSEC Usually Needs Lots of Time to Decide\nRegardless of the 45 or 90-day initial time frame, the Commission has extended the consideration period repeatedly for SolidX.\nFinally, on January 3 this year, the Commission announced that it “finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider this proposed rule change.” It then designated March 30, 2017, as the date by which the proposed rule change for SolidX should either be approved or disapproved, which is 240 days from the date of the publication in the Federal Register.\nAs with SolidX, the Commission could take 240 days from the Federal Register publication date to decide on the BIT’s listing, which would likely be in early October.\nHowever, experts are predicting little chance of any Bitcoin trusts being approved by the SEC. Needham & Company, for example, said that the chance is less than 25 percent.\nDo you think the SEC will approve the Bitcoin Investment Trust’s listing? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "text": "\n Bitcoin will soon be legally recognized as a method of payment in Japan. The bill with provisions for cryptocurrencies has recently passed through the period of public consultation and will enter into force in April.\nAlso read: Coincheck’s Growth Reveals Surging Japanese Bitcoin Trade\nBitcoin.com examines what the bill means and how it could affect Bitcoin with Special Counsel at Anderson Mori & Tomotsune, Ken Kawai, who has held numerous speaking engagements on the legal issues of virtual currency regulations in Japan.\nCountdown: The Long Awaited Bill\nSince Bitcoin’s inception, its legal position in Japan has not been clear. The first bill containing provisions for virtual currencies including Bitcoin was submitted to the Diet last March. It amends the existing Payment Services Act and the Act on Preventing of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds.\n“The revision of the Payment Services Act, which sets out the basic framework of virtual currency regulation, was promulgated last June”, Kawai told Bitcoin.com. The drafts of detailed regulations and guidelines were published in December and the period for public consultation on the bill ended on January 27, he continued, adding that:\n\nThe new regulations will enter into force in April 2017.\n\nNew Method of Payment but Not Currency\nThis bill defines virtual currencies including bitcoin and imposes certain regulations on virtual currency exchange services with the aim to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing as well as to protect users.\nWhile the bill recognizes them as a new method of payment in Japan, virtual currencies are not classified as “currencies” however. Kawai confirmed:\n\n “Virtual currency” is distinguished clearly from “currency” in the regulations.\n\nEven though Bitcoin is not considered a currency, being recognized by the government as a payment method will “likely have a positive effect on people’s mind and facilitate usage of VC’s [virtual currencies]”, he believes.\nBitcoin usage has already been growing considerably in Japan. Japanese exchange Coincheck revealed significant growth in its user base, rising from 14,000 users last April to 76,400 in January. In addition, the exchange reported gigantic growth in the number of bitcoin-accepting merchants using its service. Also, Japanese giant GMO Internet group has recently announced that it would be developing a bitcoin exchange and wallet service.\nMeanwhile, Japan now has the second-largest bitcoin trading volume globally, according to Coinhills.\nBitcoin’s Other Legal Considerations in Japan\nWhile usage as a payment method should not be affected whether bitcoin is legally considered a ‘currency’ or not, Kawai explained that, from a legal standpoint, there are some considerable differences.\n“For instance, if they are defined as “currencies”, lending of VCs must comply with Money Lending Control Act (which requires lenders to register as “Moneylenders”) and VCs’ derivatives must comply with the Financial Instrument Exchange Act”, he described.\nSome other countries have classified virtual currency as an asset or property for tax purposes such as the U.S. Recently, Israel has issued a draft which considers Bitcoin an asset, therefore imposing Value Added Tax (VAT) as well as capital gains tax on bitcoin transactions.\nHowever, for Japan, this bill does not define virtual currency as “property”. Instead, virtual currencies are defined as ‘proprietary value’, Kawai contrasted, adding that “a precedent of Tokyo District Court denies the concept of having ‘property rights’ of Bitcoin”. Furthermore, “it is not uncertain what is the legal nature of proprietary value in Japanese civil laws”, he clarified, adding that “I do not expect that the government is leaning towards proactively considering it as “property”.\nDo you think Bitcoin adoption in Japan will explode when this bill becomes law?

    "text": "\n This month the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) recently sought out a continuation of its court hearing with Coinbase. The initial hearing was scheduled to be held on February 16, but the tax agency now wants to postpone the hearing until March 23. The case will also begin with a motion from a former Coinbase customer concerning the tax agency’s request for customer’s data from 2013 to 2015.\nAlso read: IRS Demands Coinbase Records In Surprise Tax Probe\nThe IRS Requests to Reschedule the John Doe Summons Hearing \nIn November 2016, the IRS revealed a ‘John Doe’ summons against Coinbase. The tax agency is looking to obtain customer records “for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015, of United States persons who conducted transactions in a convertible virtual currency.” The IRS is particularly looking for those not reporting their taxes when using the cryptocurrency with the regulated exchange.\nFollowing this event, Coinbase vowed to fight the matter in court as the company, and many within the Bitcoin community, believed the probe was an invasion of privacy. Furthermore, a Coinbase customer has entered his own litigation and is asking the tax agency to withdraw the court summons. Attorney and Coinbase user Jeffrey Berns filed a motion in December to fight the IRS request for the information on 3 million users. The initial proceedings would begin next week, but now the IRS has asked to reschedule the court hearing for March 23.\nCase 3:16-cv-06658-JSC, Document 28, Filed February 2, 2017.\n‘Sparing the Parties’ Time and Expense’\nThe purpose of the delay is so that the tax agency may pursue or “take other action with respect to the John Doe summons.” The case filed in the District Court for the Northern District of California will give all three parties more time to formulate arguments for the litigation process. Both Coinbase and Berns have not filed a motion to fight the delayed court hearing. Due to the statements made by the tax agency, the other parties involved may be interested in finding out why the IRS has decided to postpone the hearing.\n“If more time is provided a hearing on movants’ motions may be avoided altogether, sparing the Court’s judicial resources and the Parties’ time and expense,” explains the IRS’ proposed motion on February 2.\nCoinbase Could Pay $1 Million in Legal Costs Fighting the ‘Broad Subpoena’\nBrian Armstrong, Founder of Coinbase.\nCoinbase has been vocal about the case from the get-go and has explained that people should pay their taxes, but the ‘John Doe’ summons is too reaching.\n“I believe Coinbase and the IRS fundamentally want the same thing: for all U.S. users of virtual currency to pay their taxes,” details Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong in January. “And I believe our prior actions demonstrate that we are committed to making this happen. I also feel that the IRS sending us a John Doe summons on all customer accounts is not the best way for us to mutually accomplish this objective.”\nThe implications of this proceeding could be pretty significant towards the privacy rights of bitcoiners if the IRS manages to gain access to Coinbase customer data. The San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange believes they will spend a lot of time and money throughout this legal battle. “We will likely incur a legal cost of between $100,000 and $1,000,000 in the process of defending our customers from this overly broad subpoena,” says the Coinbase founder.\nWhat do you think about the upcoming IRS court hearing between Coinbase and a former customer?

The news follows China’s central bank inspections at nine smaller Bitcoin exchanges this week.\nAlso read: China to Play a ‘Leading Role’ in Bitcoin’s Future\nChina’s Central Bank Continues to Shake Up the Bitcoin Market\nOver the past few weeks, Bitcoin spectators have been closely watching Chinese exchanges make significant changes. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has been inspecting the country’s Bitcoin exchanges looking for issues with regulatory compliance such as money laundering. So far the top three exchange platforms have ceased margin lending practices and have also added fees to every Bitcoin trade. \nNow, this week the PBOC has visited with smaller exchanges within the region including Chbtc, Haobtc, Btctrade, Yunbi, BTC100, Dahonghuo, Jubi, Bitbay, and Yuanbao. The initial visits had caused the price to drop a touch but quickly rose back to the $1070 range on February 8. The following day on February 9 the exchanges Okcoin and Huobi announced they would suspend BTC and LTC withdrawals for one month which subsequently caused the Bitcoin price to drop 10 percent.\nFollowing the Huobi and Okcoin announcements, Bitcoin’s price drops 10% during the early hours of February 9. \nBoth companies have stated their exchanges will be “upgrading” in order to comply with “anti-money laundering efforts, foreign exchange management and other financial laws and regulations.” The pausing of withdrawals and the upgrades are expected to last one month but “may also be substantially ahead of the development process,” says Huobi’s announcement. This “in order to avoid possible illegal transactions that may continue before the system upgrade is complete,” Huobi’s announcement concludes.\n\nOKCoin, Huobi: will upgrade AML system according to laws & regulations, pausing BTC LTC withdraw during the upgrade.

    "text": "\n The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued a statement on Thursday regarding a meeting it held the previous day with nine Chinese bitcoin exchanges. When the news of the meeting broke, the price of bitcoin dropped almost six percent but quickly regained its high only hours later, and has continued to rise.\nAlso read: Chinese Bitcoin Exchange Inspections Cause Price Drop and FUD \nPBOC’s Meeting with Nine Bitcoin Exchanges\nThe PBOC’s statement posted on its website on Thursday states that its Business Management Department was meeting with the main persons in charge of nine bitcoin exchanges on Wednesday. The nine exchanges invited were Chbtc, Btctrade, Haobtc, Yunbi, Yuanbao, BTC100, Jubi, Bitbay and Dahonghuo.\nAccording to a translation of the statement, the central bank informed those\nexchanges of existing problems, and potential legal, regulatory, as well as technical risks. The exchanges were subsequently required “not to take part in financial activities such as margin lending or allow money laundering”, Reuters translated.\nIn addition, they cannot violate laws concerning anti-money laundering (AML), foreign currency payments and management, or violate regulations about taxes and commercial advertisements. Any exchanges that are found to be in serious violation of those requirements can be closed down, the central bank states.\nBitcoin’s Price Proves Resilient\nWhen the news about the meeting broke, roughly a day before the PBOC’s announcement was posted, the price of bitcoin dropped $60 USD on Bitfinex from $1,066 to $1,006 in under an hour. However, it soon rebounded completely, and 19 hours and twenty minutes later, the price had overtaken its previous level.\n\nPBOC Losing Influence over Bitcoin’s Price\nThere have been three noticeable drops in bitcoin’s price coinciding with the PBOC’s actions this year, each progressively less influential.\nThe First Drop\nThe first one started on January 5, when the price of bitcoin was at a three-year high of $1,166 on Bitfinex. The exchange’s all time high was $1,175 on December 1, 2013, and that level has yet to be reached again.\n\nThe first of the three price drops took a few days to reach bottom after the PBOC made a pair of statements on its website saying that its officials have met with the heads of BTCChina, Huobi, and OKCoin to discuss their business models and products. No ban was made but the price dropped to $815 over the next day, only rebounding partially before the next piece of PBOC-related news made headlines.\nThe Second Drop\nThe second price drop occurred on January 11, when the PBOC launched spot checks on China’s same top three bitcoin exchanges. Some media outlets called the action a “raid,” but BTCChina took to twitter to dispel the myth, and set the story straight.\nDuring the meeting, the price of a bitcoin plunged from $924 to $735, a fall of over 20 percent, rebounding to $790 by the end of the day. In the aftermath, it became known that the Chinese exchanges would have to put an end to their practice of allowing zero-fee and margin trading, both of which are known to artificially boost trading volumes. The three exchanges subsequently confirmed that they had stopped offering margin loans after the discussion with the PBOC.\nThe Third Drop\nThe Wednesday drop was far smaller than the previous two and came at a time when the yuan is no longer the currency with the largest bitcoin trading volume. Ever since the January 11 inspections, China’s share of global bitcoin trade has fallen from 99 percent to a mere 33 percent, allowing Japanese yen trading to surpass Chinese trading volumes for the first time.\nThe nine exchanges mentioned in Thursday’s notice from the PBOC do not include the original three mentioned above. There are also at least 19 bitcoin exchanges trading the yuan with daily volume, including a couple based outside of the country.

    "text": "\n Just recently Bitcoin.com reported on the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) Senior Risk Analysis Officer, Patrick Armstrong’s opinion to ban blockchain platforms. However, on February 7 the ESMA has released a report stating that regulating the technology at this early stage is “premature.”\nAlso read: European Commission’s New Boost for Bitcoin and Blockchain Startups\nESMA Says Regulating Blockchain Would Be ‘Premature’\nThe European market regulatory agency the ESMA has revealed it believes regulating blockchain technology at this time would be premature. The ESMA has been researching distributed ledger technology (DLT) for quite some time in order to craft regulatory framework. Then in November, ESMA executive Patrick Armstrong told attendees at a blockchain conference the technology could be banned. However, the report issued by the ESMA on February 7 is quite different than Armstrong’s approach.\n“At this stage, ESMA believes that it is premature to fully appreciate the changes that the technology could bring and the regulatory response that may be needed, given that the technology is still evolving and practical applications are limited both in number and scope,” explains the ESMA’s recent report.\nDistributed Ledger Technology May Be Innovative But Not Excluded From Regulation\nThe report states the ESMA believes digital currency solutions and DLT innovation can bring numerous benefits to financial markets. This includes “more efficient post-trade services, enhanced reporting capabilities, and reduced costs. ESMA expects the early applications of DLT to focus on optimizing processes using the current market structure,” says the EU’s regulatory agency.\nHowever, the ESMA believes there are significant regulatory challenges ahead for DLTs. Issues include interoperability with other frameworks, privacy problems, and investment risks. The ESMA says that even though these technologies are innovative, they are not excluded from current regulations and laws. The ESMA report explains:\n\nThe development of a new technology, such as DLT, does not liberate users from complying with the existing regulatory framework, which provides important safeguards to ensure the stability and proper functioning of financial markets.\n\nUnable to Assess a Regulatory Response for Blockchain \nFor now, at this stage, the ESMA is unable to fully assess the regulatory response needed to deal with blockchain technology. It is “premature” to apply regulations to a “technology still evolving, and practical applications are limited both in number and scope,” the ESMA adds.\nGoing forward the ESMA details it will continue to monitor blockchain market development and assess when a regulatory response is needed. The European agency calls for “active engagement” from existing regulators in regards to DLT frameworks.\n“Active engagement from regulators and coordination at EU and international level are paramount in ESMA’s view to ensure both that DLT does not create unintended risks and that its benefits are not hindered by undue obstacles,” details the EU regulatory committee. “Meanwhile, ESMA believes that the industry should work towards solutions to address the challenges posed by the technology.”\nWhat do you think about the ESMA taking a hands-off approach to blockchain technology regulation?

After the country’s central bank implemented new regulatory inspections and policies a lot has changed for Chinese bitcoin exchanges. According to regional sources, a meeting took place between two Chinese bitcoin exchanges and financial authorities on February 17 with intentions to form an alliance to address regulatory issues. Additionally, Chinese bitcoin traders are finding alternatives amidst the regulatory confusion and exchange policy changes. \nAlso read: Call for a Digital Geneva Convention Could Affect Bitcoin\nChinese Authorities and Bitcoin Exchanges Form a Regulatory Alliance \nThe former vice-governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) XL Wu and other Chinese financial authorities have recently met with representatives from several large chinese bitcoin exchanges to discuss compliance. The meeting at the Museum of Internet Finance saw representatives establish ways bitcoin exchanges can comply with Chinese regulations and form a regulatory partnership.\nTen points were discussed on how bitcoin exchanges could meet the demands of regulators. According to the report, XL Wu added the tenth point, which may protect the privacy of bitcoin exchange users. The new proposed rules includes calls for the following;\n\nThe creation of a specific department for risk control and compliance.\nA system-wide implementation of governance rules and security mechanisms. Third parties will evaluate this procedure. \nExchanges must refuse to cooperate with risky companies and obey AML/KYC regulatory guidelines. \nKeeping records; companies in the industry should report to both the alliance and local regulators about information of the company including company title, info of the head of the company, business model, risks in the business, risk control mechanisms. \nEducating the public on risks associated with the industry including ICOs. \nDeploy anti-money laundering, anti-telecom fraud mechanisms. Use video and biometrics verification to upgrade real-name (verifying) systems.\nAnti-Ponzi scheme; exchanges must set limits on user withdrawals and add delays to withdraw requests.\nAnti-manipulation and embezzlement policies must be enforced. \nExchanges must share info to peers, deploying the use of whitelisting and blacklisting. \nA digital asset is also a type of personal asset. So the safety of it also represents the safety of a personal asset. Personal information is abused on the Internet, which is a threat to the safety of personal assets.

Volumes have quadrupled on Localbitcoins reaching the country’s all-time-high. Furthermore, according to the regional publication 8BTC, Chinese high-frequency traders (HFT) are finding different avenues to exchange. The publication states that it is believed that roughly 80 percent of transactions were conducted by HFT traders on exchanges such as Huobi, Okcoin, and BTCC. \nAn HFT trader tells 8BTC that when the 0.03-0.2% trading fees commenced HFT traders had trouble adjusting and capturing a profit was “almost impossible.” According to the report, many of these traders have moved into other markets such as foreign futures and Over-The-Counter (OTC) operations. According to our own sources in China, “Some of the big high-frequency traders are doing OTC themselves too.” Additionally, 8BTC says the exchange BTCC indicates more bitcoin regulations may be on the way.\nChinese Localbitcoins volumes February 2017.\nFurthermore, bitcoin withdrawals from one exchange are slowly coming back online. On February 20th the smaller bitcoin exchange BTC123 announced it would be lifting its withdrawal suspension. However, the rules for withdrawals have changed, creating a slower process. According to sources users will be able to withdraw five btc or less over a twelve hour time period, on BTC123. If the withdrawal exceeds five bitcoins, users must wait 48 hours for the request to be processed. So far no other bitcoin exchanges have announced lifting withdrawal suspensions.\nWhat do you think about the recent happenings in China concerning bitcoin trading? Let us know in the comments below.

    "text": "\n The European Parliament published an “in-depth analysis” on Tuesday on blockchain technology, focusing on “how Bitcoin’s dominance of the blockchain field could affect wider development of the technology and other applications of distributed ledgers”, its authors wrote. The 28-page report entitled ‘How blockchain technology could change our lives’ was put together by the European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS).\nAlso read: Europe Committed to Tightening Digital Currency Rules by End of 2017 \nBlockchains: Bitcoin’s vs Government’s\nThe purpose of the report is to assist the Members and staff of the Parliament “in their parliamentary work”. However, opinions expressed in it are of the authors alone. Two out of three authors, Philip Boucher and Mihalis Kritikos, are from the European Parliament’s Scientific Foresight Unit. The third, Susana Nascimento, is from the European Commission’s Foresight, Behavioural Insights and Design for Policy Unit.\nThe paper covers both the public and private sector’s use of blockchain technology and highlights the differences between the two. It explains that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies “could spearhead a process of decentralisation whereby the institutions that traditionally govern finances – including governments and banks – become less powerful”.\nHowever, the authors also noted that “these same governments and banks are currently driving blockchain research and development in directions that suit their own purposes. These blockchains may prove less decentralised and transparent than others”. Citing use cases beyond the financial system, the report suggests that:\n\nBitcoin et al provide a wide user base, fertile spaces for experimentation and ‘fuel’ to propel new ideas forward. Even if Bitcoin does not revolutionise the financial system, it might well pave the way for other implementations that could offer serious benefits for supply chains and government services, for example.\n\nProof of Existence is no Patent Protection\nThe report went on to discuss blockchain proof of existence, citing that these low-cost services can make the current patent systems more efficient.\nHowever, the authors warn: “It must be made clear that proof of existence via a blockchain (or, indeed, any other means) cannot be interpreted as equivalent to patent protection”.\nThey also explain that “For proof of existence provided by third parties, such as those that make use of the existing Bitcoin blockchain, to be accepted as a legitimate means for keeping records, they would have to be recognised as such by the appropriate enforcement bodies”.\nPiggybacking Bitcoin Preferred\nWhile claiming how transactions in Europe are usually already fast, cheap and secure, the report authors say users of blockchain applications see additional benefits in its transparency and immutability. They noted:\n\n Indeed, since other applications can ‘piggyback’ the Bitcoin blockchain, the biggest impacts of Bitcoin may be found outside the currency domain. Transactions of any kind are usually faster and cheaper for the user when completed via a blockchain, and they also benefit from the protocol’s security. \n\nBlockchain-enabled e-voting (BEV) is an example of a blockchain application in the report. BEV would allow voters to log and verify records that are transparent and distributed among users. The authors suggest that a cheap and easy way to develop BEV is to “’piggyback’ a more established blockchain, such as Bitcoin”.\nThe report also describes a greater social awareness of the blockchain’s usefulness, which it says coincides with a loss of trust in governments and the banking system. It states: “Indeed, there is a growing trend towards less trust in financial and governance institutions and greater social expectations of accountability and responsibility. The popularity of blockchain technology may also reflect an emerging social trend to prioritise transparency over anonymity”.\nWhat do you think of this EU Parliament report?

The severity of the bug is considered very bad, and security credentials for many bitcoin accounts should be changed.\nAlso read: The Bitcoin Exchange Thefts You May Have Forgotten\nCloudbleed Vulnerability May Affect Bitcoin Users\nThe Cloudflare system has reportedly been leaking significant amounts of uninitialized memory which could contain sensitive data, including two-factor authentication (2FA) secrets and passwords.  According to many reports including the person who found the bug, this may have been happening for months, and the data may have been spraying onto the open web.\nThe leak could possibly lead to people’s accounts being compromised on many bitcoin websites and services. Bitcoin websites that could be affected include Coinbase, Localbitcoins, Poloniex, Kraken, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Bitstamp, Reddit, and many more. Many people in the bitcoin community are warning others to reset their 2FAs and change passwords immediately. Alongside this, bitcoin companies who may have been affected are also warning customers to take the necessary precautions.\n“A bug was recently discovered with Cloudflare, which Kraken and many other websites use for DoS protection and other services,” states the San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange Kraken. “Due to the nature of the bug, we recommend as a precaution that you change your Kraken security credentials: Change your password, Change your two-factor authentication (remove and re-enable it), Clients who use API keys should generate a new set of keys. You should similarly change your security credentials for other websites that use Cloudflare.”\nThe Extent of the Damage Could be Severe \nThe Cloudflare issue is very reminiscent of the Linode attacks in 2012 and the Heartbleed vulnerability back in the spring of 2014. However whether or not Cloudflare’s leak got into malicious hands is undetermined, but Bitcoiners on forums are shaken up. The uninitialized memory held by the Cloudflare service includes data such as cookies, HTTP content, passwords, and TLS certificates. The person who discovered the bug, Taviso says, “Cloudflare reverse proxies are dumping uninitialized memory.” Furthermore, Taviso also details “It took every ounce of strength not to call this issue ‘Cloudbleed’”\n“I don’t know if this issue was noticed and exploited, but I’m sure other crawlers have collected data and that users have saved or cached content and don’t realize what they have, etc.,” explains Taviso’s opinion concerning the extent of the damage. “We’ve discovered (and purged) cached pages that contain private messages from well-known services, PII from major sites that use cloudflare, and even plaintext API requests from a popular password manager that were sent over https (!!).”\nTo stay precautious Bitcoin users should take a few minutes to change their passwords and reset their 2FA’s on certain accounts.

    "text": "\n Bitcoin mining is an integral part of the cryptocurrency’s infrastructure. The operation helps process transactions, creates new bitcoins and submits the validated transactions to the publicized and immutable distributed ledger. \nCurrently, the network’s hashrate is running at a phenomenal 3,418,031,852 GH/s, strengthening the bitcoin architecture more so each and every day. But many newcomers hearing about bitcoin for the first time wonder, How does bitcoin mining actually work?\nAlso Read: Bitcoin’s Rocket Boosters on Full Throttle as Price Skyrockets to New ATH\nBitcoin Mining: How it Works\nBitcoin mining requires the use of a specialized mining computer and software to solve mathematical equations. Miners consist of individuals or organizations running this software who compete with each other to solve these puzzles.\nA mining device and cgminer software.\nWhen people transact with bitcoin, all of the network’s nodes share information about new transactions in a transaction queue called a mempool. Blocks of transactions are not accepted into a blockchain’s ledger until miners perform a hash function solving the puzzle, which in turn verifies the legitimacy of transactions contained in that specific block. This means miners can try and mine blocks of transactions by hashing (attempting to solve the equation) from a string of numbers and letters.\nAn example of a hash function. Hash functions are cryptographically irreversible. Inputs can be any length, but output strings are always predetermined. If any changes are made to the sentence such as— Visit News Bitcoin.com for the latest bitcoin “articles”— the output string of alphanumeric digits would also change.\nA miner solves the problem with another string of random digits by computing a lucky hash result which is followed by a reward of 12.5 bitcoins and all the transaction fees as well. Hashing requires significant processing time and resources to solve these problems. Deciphering the cryptography in a hash function is not easy and requires brute computational force. All of the miners simultaneously trying to solve these problems create the network’s hashrate. Once a puzzle is solved by the miner the result is called proof-of-work.\nThe mathematical puzzles solved are impossible to predict without overcoming the difficulty of finding a particular hash value. Mining rigs or devices that mine bitcoins continuously try and solve these puzzles over and over until miners get the correct answer.\nThe process not only incentivizes miners monetarily, but also ensures transactions are validated correctly. Every block also hosts the hash of the previous block mined before it. This, in turn, makes sure the system maintains an accurate chain of information which essentially becomes tamper resistant.\nLet’s Recap:\n\nBitcoin transactions are sent to nodes.\nEvery node has a separate transaction queue called a mempool.  \nNodes relay the information. Some nodes can mine using specialized devices, ASIC chips and mining software, to solve equations while trying to find a block.\nSolving these puzzles means miners are given a string of alphanumeric digits and they have to hash the string of digits with another random string that begins with multiple zeros.\nMiners use lots of processing power trying to mathematically link (solve the equation) the strings of digits. Mining devices continuously hash (attempt to solve) these puzzles until a block is found.    \nIf successful at hashing a puzzle, miners are currently rewarded 12.5 BTC. Every four years the reward halves. \n\nBitcoin mining can be hard to understand when you’re first introduced to the digital currency. But, once you get a grasp of the concept, it’s not so hard to understand the symbiotic relationship of mining and securing the network. \nA more in-depth look at how mining works can be found here at our Bitcoin.com Wiki page.    \nWhat do you think about the process of bitcoin mining?

Check Out These Alternative Exchange Traded Bitcoin-Backed Instruments\nSpeculation Versus Long-Term Trends\nThe Bloomberg reporter delivered this analysis as bitcoin’s overall percentage of the digital currency market had fallen in the wake of a rejected Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHowever, even as the 125th Bitcoin obituary was being penned, as recorded by a website which tracks such things, bitcoin’s price rebounded quickly after the SEC’s decision on Friday. The digital currency trades at $1,246 at the time of writing.\n\n\nGoogle Trends suggests that Bitcoin’s popularity still far outpaces other cryptocurrencies. As seen above, more Google users query bitcoin than the next cryptocurrency by a considerable margin.\nDespite the decline in its overall percentage of the total cryptocurrency market, bitcoin remains within its historical average of 80-90%. Its nadir, according to Coinmarketcap, took place approximately one year ago when bitcoin fell to below 75% of all cryptocurrency markets combined.\nThe total combined ‘altcoin’ market capitalization broke through to new highs after the SEC’s decision and now sits at about $5 billion overall. According to social media, traders cashed out of bitcoin when the price peaked and found safe harbor in altcoins. For instance, after the SEC’s ETF decision, demand for altcoins spiked and there were price gains across the board on popular trading platforms.\n“It would be quite hard not to profit from altcoins because everything is pumping”, suggested one cryptocurrency enthusiast, hinting that speculation, not unique use cases, fed the increased demand for bitcoin alternatives. \nBitcoin’s overall percentage of the market remains within its historical range even as Ethereum, the second-largest bitcoin alternative, breaks new price records. The smart contract-based blockchain project reached an all-time high of $24 over the weekend. \nBitcoin as a Risk Management Tool\n“I think investors are looking at [Bitcoin] as a risk management tool”, says Mr. Ganguly. “In China, there are suspicions that people use it to get money out of the country, capital outflows. So, I am not sure that [the SEC’s] decision, about four years in the making, will have a huge effect on people who need the digital currency for the purposes that they do”.\n\nThe SEC taking four years to investigate whether or not to approve a rule change to make way for a Bitcoin ETF might even lend legitimacy to the digital currency in the minds of some investors.\nWriting for Forbes, Laura Shin noted that blockchain analysts Chris Burniske (Ark Invest) and Spencer Bogart (Blockchain Capital) liked the fact that the SEC was thorough and thoughtful in its Bitcoin ETF decision.\n“They clearly put a lot of thought into investigating the bitcoin markets and took time to explain their reasoning”, Burniske said.\nBogart added: “If I’m an institutional trading desk, maybe now I can’t do the ETF, but [the SEC decision-making process] has changed my appetite to trade bitcoin as a whole”.\nWhat do you think about bitcoin’s recent decline in the overall market share of digital currency market?

    "text": "\n Europe is seeking to further tighten its grip on digital currencies including bitcoin. Previously, the European Commission has only proposed strict rules for digital currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers. Last week, the European Parliament proposed additional amendments meant to regulate digital currency businesses, adding a multitude of business categories, specifically disallowing anonymity.\nAlso read: Europe Committed to Tightening Digital Currency Rules by End of 2017\nEU Legislative Process\nThe European Commission has already published its proposal to amend ‘Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing’ to include digital currencies including bitcoin last July.\nThe next step of the EU legislative procedure is for the European Parliament to either adopt the Commission’s proposal or amend it. In this case, the Parliament chose to amend. Therefore, on Thursday, a report was published outlining their amendments to what the Commission proposed.\nEU to Regulate Most Digital Currency Businesses\nWhile the Commission only proposed extending the scope of Directive (EU) 2015/849 to include virtual currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers, the European Parliament’s proposal seeks to include much more.\nLike exchanges and wallet providers, the Parliament claims that many other types of businesses are under no obligation to identify suspicious activity. “Terrorist groups are thus able to transfer money into the Union’s financial system or within virtual currency networks by concealing transfers or by benefiting from a certain degree of anonymity on those platforms”, the Parliament wrote, noting that:\n\nIt is therefore essential to extend the scope of Directive (EU) 2015/849 so as to include virtual currency exchange platforms, custodian wallet providers, issuers, administrators, intermediaries and distributors of virtual currencies, and administrators and providers of systems for online payments. Competent authorities should be able to monitor the use of virtual currencies in order to identify suspicious activities.\n\nThe Parliament then proposes that all Member States shall ensure that all businesses falling into the above categories “are licensed or registered”.\n“This would provide a balanced and proportional approach, at the same time safeguarding both the innovative technical advances offered by such currencies and the high degree of transparency attained in the field of alternative finance and social entrepreneurship”, the Parliament claims, adding that:\n\nTo combat the risks related to the anonymity, virtual currencies should not be anonymous and national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) should be able to associate virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currencies.\n\nModifying Digital Currency-Related Definitions\nThe Parliament also redefines digital currencies at the suggestion of the European Central Bank which said that the Commission’s “definition of virtual currency needs improving”.\nThere is now a clause stating that digital currencies do “not possess a legal status of currency or money”. In addition, the proposal adds the definition of a “custodian wallet provider” which was previously not defined.\nA custodian wallet provider now “means an entity that provides services to safeguard private cryptographic keys on behalf of their customers, to holding, store and transfer virtual currencies”. In addition, the parliament has added a new line to the definition which reads:\n\nVirtual currencies cannot be anonymous.\n\nWhat do you think of the European Parliament’s amendments?

BIPs represent a central avenue for communicating ideas to the distributed Bitcoin community.\nBIP100 Puts Miners First\nJeff Garzik\nThe BIP would theoretically allow miners to vote on what the block size limit should be. Mr. Harding believes that miners are actually more invested in Bitcoin than other participants in the peer-to-peer network, and thus better equipped to make decisions.\n“They invest in hardware that cannot be used for anything else, and they are the one group that will always, every day, be paid in bitcoin and no other currency”, the Bitcoin developer says. “In the aggregate, miners’ stewardship of the protocol secures Bitcoin. This was Satoshi’s design and it has proven correct beyond all expectations”.\nWhen he first read BIP100, Mr. Harding did not like it. “I believed in June 2015 that miners might manipulate the block size in ways that were not in the best interest of all users”, he tells Bitcoin.com. “But over the next two years, it was we developers who showed ourselves unable to manage the maximum block size reasonably”.\nThe text for BIP100 puts vivid emphasis on the miners. “Miners directly feel the effects, both positive and negative, of any maximum block size change imposed by their peers”, reads the proposal on Github. “Larger blocks allow more growth in the on-chain ecosystem, while smaller blocks reduce resource requirements network-wide”.\nAccording to the Github proposal, miners act as an “efficient proxy” for the Bitcoin system since they earn bitcoins when they create blocks.\nIn order to be deployed, BIP100 needs to garner a considerable amount of support from miners. “A simple deterministic system is specified, whereby a 75% mining supermajority may activate a change to the maximum block size each 2016 blocks”, reads the proposal. “Each change is limited to a 5% increase from the previous block size hard limit, or a decrease of similar magnitude”.\nTom Harding\nAmong adopting nodes, there will be no disagreement on the evolution of the maximum block size, according to BIP100. “The system is compatible with emergent consensus, but whereas under that system a miner may choose to accept any size block, a miner following BIP100 observes the 75% supermajority rule, and the 5% change limit rule”, the proposal reads. \n“Excessive-block values signaled by emergent consensus blocks are considered in the calculation of the BIP100 block size hard limit, and the BIP100 calculated maximum block size is signaled as an excessive-block value for the benefit of all observers”.\nCarrots, Sticks and Speed Limits\nBIP100 has been in the making for nearly two years. The proposal was published first by Mr. Garzik, who runs the enterprise blockchain firm Bloq, and who enjoys waxing about the intersection of artificial intelligence and Bitcoin.\n“Economic actors that wish to see the speed limit [block-size limit] at X or Y – thus dictating the free market – will lobby the Chief Scientist and other ‘core’ developers, individually, in private, in public, with carrots, and with sticks”, writes Mr. Garzik in the draft for BIP 100. “When [the] Bitcoin market cap [grows 10 times] or more, the lobbying [will be] even more intense. Yet there is no single human or commitment on the planet capable of picking a good speed limit”.\nDoes BIP100 offer a tenable solution to Bitcoin’s growth issues? Let us know in the comments below.

    "text": "\n “Shapeshift’s volume has been crazy, to put it mildly”, according to Erik Voorhees, founder of the digital currency exchange, Shapeshift. The exchange, which allows users to trade between digital assets like bitcoin and ether, has grown exponentially so far in 2017. \nAlso Read: Counterparty Token Doubles Year to Date Thanks to Real World Use-Cases \nShapeshift has, in part, been legitimized over time thanks to integration into hardware wallets and several popular applications, including wallets like Jaxx and Exodus. In addition, the exchange is dedicated to the so-called ‘altcoin’ space, a diverse and voluminous landscape of Bitcoin alternatives, which also adds to its legitimacy.\nExponential Growth\n\n“To date, our best month ever was $20 million, which was this past January and that was up about 30% from December 2016”, Mr. Voorhees tells Bitcoin.com in an emailed statement. “In March thus far, we’ve processed over $30m, so we [are on target to] more than double our highest month ever”.\nShapeshift regularly adds new altcoins and requires neither emails nor passwords, and thus no signups and accounts. All of this might have contributed to its recent success. \nIn the 24 hours between March 13 and 14, Shapeshift processed over 4,300 customer orders totaling about $3 million, according to the CEO, who also once ran popular Bitcoin gaming site Satoshidice. The volume is coming primarily from trades between bitcoin, dash, ether, and monero. \n“Augur and Zcash are also under heavy load”, he adds.\nBTC Payments ‘Increasingly Unreliable’\nErik Voorhees, Shapeshift CEO\nShapeshift customer support staff has been working “nearly non-stop to process orders and refunds” as needed, according to Mr. Voorhees. “Unfortunately, some of why Shapeshift is not running perfectly smooth has to do with much-publicized Bitcoin scaling problems”.\nBitcoin’s recent scaling issues, which have seen transaction volume bump up against its 1 MB data limit, have created a transaction confirmation backlog. \n“The Bitcoin transaction delays have been really frustrating for us and our customers”, according to Mr. Voorhees, who wrote one of the first long-form pieces on the digital currency, Bitcoin: A Libertarian Introduction. “Even when we send transactions with high fees, which keep getting higher, our customer may not receive bitcoin for an hour or sometimes a day and it’s impossible to predict ahead of time”.\n\nBitcoin payments have become increasingly unreliable and expensive for Shapeshift. “Those in the Bitcoin community who are not dealing with thousands of customer orders per day probably don’t appreciate the serious degradation in Bitcoin utility that has been occurring for over a year, and very intensely for the past few months”.\nHe adds: “Regardless, the digital asset industry is just on fire right now, in a good way, and it’s impossible not to be thrilled with the growth across multiple assets”.\nWhat do you think about Shapeshift as a digital asset application?

    "text": "\n As Bitcoin’s scaling debate intensifies, many people are choosing sides and thinking of solutions that best suit their subjective opinions of how the network should operate. Now discussions on Bitcoin’s blockchain possibly forking has caused some people to consider trying to change the digital currency’s Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism.\nAlso read: Bitpay Confident in Bitcoin, But Raises Its Minimum Transaction Size\nBitcoin Community Members and Developers Propose Changing Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work\nThe past week in bitcoin-land it’s been quite a ride, to say the least. Scaling topics have now eclipsed all discussions concerning the March 10 ETF decision. Most of the “community” is now focused on the block size debate and the possibility of a hard fork in the near future. There are those who vehemently oppose a hard fork and have decided to come up with solutions to avoid the situation by proposing some ideas that are very controversial. This week community members and Bitcoin Core developers such as Luke-jr have been discussing trying to change Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm.\nOf course, the discussion of changing PoW has stirred contentious arguments once again. Many people within the community believe the PoW consensus mechanism is one foundation within Bitcoin’s code that should never change. However, the group discussing the algorithm change are afraid of “de facto control” by a great majority of the network hashrate. The group has pushed the conversation further by creating a website, and a Twitter handle to promote the idea.\n“A call for research, testing, and finally implementation of a decentralization-friendly algorithm for Bitcoin’s proof-of-work,” explains the BTC PoW Initiative website. “Bitcoin has been unable to implement a scaling solution due to greedy miners who want to keep fees high and who even mine empty blocks, not caring that it increases network congestion. — Changing the proof-of-work will fire the current crop of miners and open the door for quickly and easily scaling the network.”\nThe “BTC PoW Initiative” website.\nPoW Change Stirs Controversy  \nBitfury’s George Kikvadze on Twitter.\nAlmost immediately the community began yet another heated debate concerning this idea. A Bitfury employee, George Kikvadze, spoke against the PoW change rather sternly even saying some bitcoin community members could threaten those responsible with legal action.\n“Discussions (or even speculation) of a PoW change is super irresponsible! And even in the remote 0.01 percent chance it may happen — Those responsible, we will spare no resources, get best lawyers and prosecutors to go after you wherever you will be in the world,” Kikvadze said on Twitter. “Bitcoin has become a multi-billion industry, with great financial investment and societal responsibility. We will protect this at all cost!”\nA ‘High-Risk Move’ to Some, While Others Call It ‘Much Less Controversial’\nBitcoin developer Luke-jr.\nAnother bitcoin developer, Peter Todd, also promoted the BTC PoW Initiative to his Twitter followers on March 19. “With some miners threatening 51% attacks against Bitcoin, researching a PoW change is a good backup plan,” Todd states. However following this statement Todd details that changing the PoW consensus mechanism is risky. “Having said that, actually changing the PoW is a high-risk move; IMO best to only do that if an attack actually happens,” the developer added.  \nLots of Bitcoin proponents across the web completely opposed the idea of a PoW change, while others thought the idea should be explored, and some explained the concept should truly be a last minute resort. One Redditor exclaimed that a “Proof of Work change is a HUGE controversial change!” However, bitcoin developer Luke-jr disagreed saying, “Much less controversial than block size increases — In any case, there is no client software being promoted here, merely consensus-building.”\nIt’s clear from the many conversations across cryptocurrency forums and social media that a PoW algorithm change is a pretty touchy subject. Whether or not discussions like these go further and see actual development remains to be seen.\nWhat do you think about community members and developers discussing a PoW consensus mechanism change? Do you think the current PoW algorithm is a foundation that never should be changed? Let us know in the comments below. Images via Shutterstock, Twitter, and the BTC PoW Initiative website.

    "text": "\n What is the legality of Bitcoin in India? This is a gray area, but politicians have a tendency to say something negative about cryptocurrency. They do this to spin a yarn that it is “illegal.”\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Helps People Circumvent Economic Sanctions in Iran\nThis occurs because politicians use fear mongering to deter folks from certain behaviors, and these tactics weigh heavy on the hearts and minds of the peasant classes. People take any kind of political “warning” as an absolute dictum or law.\nIn reality, sociopaths called “world leaders” are merely passing judgement on people who choose to live freely of their own volition; they are condemning people who choose to buy stuff with their own money.\nThis exact thing happened on March 28 in India. The India Economic Times reported the minister of finance Arjun Ram Meghwal replied to the Indian Parliament, Rajya Sabha, that using Bitcoin “could” lead to consequences for anyone who dares to disobey. He said:\n“The absence of counter parties in usage of virtual currencies including Bitcoins, for illicit and illegal activities in anonymous/pseudonymous systems could subject the users to unintentional breaches of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism laws”\nApple-Gagged Politician Pigs and the Indian LSD Drug Bust\nThe key word above is “could.” This does not mean that Bitcoin is “illegal” in India. Politicians are having trouble passing specific laws to quell the use of Bitcoin. The politicians are afraid of cryptocurrency. Their laws and regulations always fall light years behind the development and evolution of technology. This causes the elites to squirm and squeal like apple-gagged pigs.\nThis fear mongering of Bitcoin comes alongside drug raids in India.\nRecently, there was a “drug ring” busted for possessing and selling LSD. For anyone unfamiliar, LSD or Lysergic acid diethylamide, is a psychedelic drug that produces visionary states of mind that allow people to heal, introspect, and experience love for life. It is not an evil drug that kills people. The only thing evil is the cops and politicians who cage the innocent for possessing the compound.\nThe Times of India reported on March 30, “The anti-narcotics cell of the city police arrested five people, including two students of two reputed colleges in the western suburbs, for drug trafficking and recovered psychedelic drug LSD worth Rs 70 lakh (about 7 million dollars) on Wednesday.”\nThe kicker is that the five people “drug ring” allegedly used bitcoin to make their sells. The media leveraged fake news to make Bitcoin sound evil as a result of the drug bust. They suggested bitcoin has been regularly used as a dastardly medium of exchange in drug transactions.\nThe media tied it in with the recent fear mongering about Bitcoin by the prime minister of India. The Times of India said, “The payments for the same were made through Bitcoins, a form of virtual currency. The government on Tuesday said Bitcoin is not authorised by RBI and any transction in it could result in breach of anti-money laundering provisions.” All of this political fear is indicative that the political class is having a fearful reaction against cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin. They are afraid their anti-humanitarian activities will be thwarted by people who want to live outside the scope of their rule. This has caused them to criticize and castigate bitcoin, while also sensationalizing the arrest of drug dealers who used bitcoin in their transactions.\nIn reality, it is false that bitcoin is illegal in India. Someone could accidentally stumble into the minefield of anti-money laundering laws and drug possession statutes, but just using Bitcoin or trading is not considered “illegal.” It’s just that it “could” be illegal, in the Prime Minister’s own words.\nThis Indian battle of whether Bitcoin should be legal or illegal, accepted and used, is really just a political dig to prevent the spread and adoption of cryptocurrencies. The Indian government is playing the age old game of thrones; they are manipulating the population to see Bitcoin as evil. They want people to run away from exploring this money rather than embrace it. In this way, Bitcoin is a new kind of enemy.\nH.L. Mencken said it best,\n“The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.”\nIn this case, Bitcoin is the hobgoblin, but the fear is indeed imaginary.\nHow can the Indian people overcome government fear mongering?  Images via Shutterstock and Wallpaperbackgrounds.com page. Do you agree with us that Bitcoin is the best invention since sliced bread? Thought so. That’s why we are building this online universe revolving around anything and everything Bitcoin. We have a store. And a forum. And a casino, a pool and real-time price statistics. \n\n\n\n\nSterlin Lujan is a journalist, editor, speaker, anarchist, and essayist.\nHe has been involved with cryptocurrency and Bitcoin since 2012.

    "text": "\n On August 2, 2016, the leading bitcoin exchange by USD volume Bitfinex suffered a major hack that drained them of 119,756 bitcoins, forcing them to issue “Recovery Rights Tokens” as an IOU to customers. These tokens have been traded as BFX tokens, but the exchange announced today that it is now paying off the debt in full.\nAlso read: Bitfinex Pays Out First Wave of Customer Refunds\nAll BFX Tokens Redeemed\nOn April 3 at 8 p.m. UST (4 p.m. EST), Bitfinex stopped all trading of their BFX tokens and started allowing users to cash them out for their full value of $1 per BFX token. Calling it the “final redemption of BFX tokens,” all trades have been closed and margin trades canceled. Those with a negative balance of BFX tokens from a margin trade will see the corresponding negative USD balance in their account.\nThe BFX tokens will all be automatically converted and then destroyed after they have stopped trading. “Overall we expect the entire process to take approximately 25–35 minutes”, the exchange revealed, adding that “no BFX tokens will remain outstanding”. During the redemption process, “trading in all other pairs will continue throughout this process, with the the temporary inconvenience of not being able to withdraw or move between wallets”, the exchange warned. In the announcement, Bitfinex also thanked its customers for their patience, stating:\n\nWe are deeply grateful for the patience and trust of our customers and shareholders as we worked towards—and have achieved—full recovery in just eight months. Without the community’s support, Bitfinex could have easily become a footnote in the history of the digital token revolution, instead of a leader and trend-setter. Thank you.\n\nThe Road to Redemption\nIt has not been easy for Bitfinex after the August 2 hack. After issuing a temporary token, a simple IOU of customer funds which couldn’t be immediately traded on the market, the exchange then finalized its recovery plans and issued the BFX recovery rights tokens. Secondary markets started trading this token immediately, for the low price of two and a half cents on the dollar at first.\nHowever, rumors circulated that BFX tokens were just a scam to buy more time and Bitfinex had to constantly reassure token holders that their plan would eventually work, and that this day would come. On September 1, the company even bought back the first 1.1% of the tokens outstanding, which helped some in the community to keep faith in the company while others were still pessimistic for several months.\nAfter much effort at the end of last year, including adding a few new trading pairs, enabling faster withdrawals, and creating an OTC trading desk for larger trades, the exchange’s volume picked up which enabled it to get out of debt at a faster pace.\nValue of the BFX token from issuance to redemption in USD\nIn Monday’s announcement, the company cited several factors which made this redemption possible. They include “a dramatic uptick in equity conversions” and “record operating results in March.” Bitfinex also gave itself some credit for “making the decision to reduce our reserves in favor of this opportunity.”\nBy the end of the week, Bitfinex plans to send more information to its shareholders to inform them of what to expect over the coming months.\nWhat do you think of Bitfinex redeeming 100% of their BFX tokens?

    "text": "\n Mexico has recently introduced a bill which defines Bitcoin as a digital asset and sets forth rules for bitcoin exchanges. Bitcoin.com spoke with Sebastian Acosta Checa, founder of Mexican bitcoin exchange ISBIT, to learn more about this new bill and its effects on the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nAlso read: How Trump’s Wall and Remittance Tax Could Give Bitcoin a Boost\n\nFirst Draft of the Bill\nBitcoin.com (BC): Can you tell us about this new bill and when it was introduced?\nSebastian Acosta Checa (SC): The first draft of this financial technology law was presented by the Secretary of Credit and Public Finance of Mexico, Jose Antonio Meade, in the 80th Mexican Banking Association Convention, held in Acapulco on March 23. In accordance with this law, the central bank will define the regulation that applies to digital assets such as Bitcoin.\nJose Antonio Meade, Secretary of Credit and Public Finance of Mexico\nThis legislation is being promoted by the Executive Branch but it still needs to be approved by Congress. Nevertheless, I have noticed wide consensus across political parties about how this can benefit the economy, trigger more foreign investment and help our industry grow.\nThis new regulation is part of the National Policy for Financial Inclusion presented by the President of Mexico on June 21, 2016. One of the axes of the policy focuses on the utilization of technological innovations to provide financial services. The government is recognizing how the technological advances have transformed the manner in which people in several industries operate, including the financial sector. It is an official priority of the state to foster the application of technological innovations to reduce the cost of financial services and widen its use among the population.\nHow Mexico Will Define Bitcoin\nBC: What does the bill say about Bitcoin?\nSC: The central bank will define what a ‘digital asset’ is by following basically two criteria. The first criteria is the widespread adoption by the public (high market cap) and the second is the protocols, rules, and mechanisms that allow generation, identification, division and control the replication of such units of account.\n\nBasically, we are talking about a currency that uses a consensus mechanism and blockchain approved by the Bank of Mexico.\n\nPersons (including miners) with digital assets, who do not perform operations on behalf of others, are not required to obtain authorization from regulators and can use digital assets in their daily commerce.\nBC: Does the bill specify what market cap is required for a cryptocurrency to be considered a digital asset? Also, is there any indication of the specifics of the consensus mechanism required?\nSC: The draft is a 76-page document that covers a lot. It addresses most legal concerns and objections to work with Bitcoin and blockchain tech in Mexico, but it does not go into that level of detail or give concrete, technical requirements.\nGuidelines will be published in the form of “Circulares” (Technical Letters) by the central bank. These letters are where, for example, the central bank will define what are legitimate “digital assets”. I can guarantee you Bitcoin and Ethereum will be there.\n\nThe most important criteria [for a digital asset] will be that the underlying technology is sound and there is widespread adoption by the public or industry.\n\nThe government’s goals are to transit to a digital economy, reduce or eliminate the use of physical cash, make the taxation process more efficient and transparent, create a mechanism to automate regulation/auditing and supervision tasks, expand the coverage of high quality and affordable financial services and more.\nRequirements for Bitcoin Exchanges\nBC: What does the law say about bitcoin exchanges?\nSC: One section of the Financial Technology Law deals specifically with ‘Digital Assets Management Institutions’ which include bitcoin exchanges such as ISBIT.\nThis section of the law explains that digital assets management institutions must be solvent and cannot operate under fractional reserves. Companies such as ISBIT are required to hold all the deposits of their clients, unlike banks that are capable of lending part of the deposits they obtain.\nIt is forbidden for bitcoin exchanges to lend or invest customers’ assets. This is a great consumer protection measure. They must also inform the public about all of the risks their clients assume when handling digital assets. In the case of services such as ours which interface with traditional banking and payment networks, we also have to obtain the legal status of an “Electronic Payment Funds Institution”.\nReserve Requirements\nBC: What are the requirements for exchanges to hold funds? Is it the same as what Hawaii requires which made Coinbase exit the state?\nSC: No, it would be completely unreasonable for the regulators to expect exchanges to hold the equivalent amount of value in fiat currency to match the digital asset deposits. That would kill our business model.\nThe intention of the regulators is not to kill the industry but rather to establish rules that will give more consumer protection and foster a safe path to mass adoption.\nExchanges must have in their vaults the amounts of digital assets that match their liabilities. For example, if users deposited 687 bitcoins, 35,820 ether, 10,000,005 pesos and 400,000 dollars, then we, as exchange operators, need to hold at least that amount in our reserves (687 bitcoins, 35,820 ether, 10,000,005 pesos and 400,000 dollars) and be able to prove it in case of an audit. Also, all customers’ assets must be clearly segregated from the exchange operators’ own capital and assets.\nBC: Other than being a bitcoin exchange, what other services does ISBIT offer?\nSC: Our platform allows the electronic exchange of fiat currency for digital assets in an open market directly between participants, ensuring zero counterparty risk. We offer 3 combined services that international trade corporations need. We provide real-time local payments, traceable and efficient cross-border payments, and low-cost FX services. Corporations in Mexico are paying significant amounts in FX and bank fees when they need to send payments to or receive payments from other regions in the world. We allow corporations to perform a cross-border transaction in a matter of minutes at significantly lower cost.\nWe have connectivity and interoperability with more than 50 banks and financial institutions in Mexico. This gives us the capability of processing real-time payments (for example, deposits or withdrawals) between our platform and bank accounts, debit cards, or cell phones linked to a bank account. This gives us access to 39% percent of the Mexican population (essentially everyone above the age of 15 with a bank account).\nTime Frame\nBC: When is this bill expected to pass?\nSC: The bill will be presented in the course of the next 2-4 weeks in the Congress of Union. I expect it to take several months for this law to pass. Nevertheless, it is very important for Bitcoin and blockchain tech companies to be prepared because, according to the draft, it will become effective from the first day it is published in the Official Journal of the Federation.\nOur company has already implemented all the corporate governance, solvency, AML, KYC and ATF controls and procedures considered by the law in order to be prepared to obtain our license the moment the law becomes effective.\nPotential Effects on Bitcoin Adoption in Mexico\nBC: How will this new regulation affect Bitcoin adoption in Mexico?\nSC: This regulation will give our industry a boost. Regulated bitcoin exchanges will be considered part of the financial system and will be able to integrate with many aspects of the economy.\n\nMany remittance companies, hedge funds, pension plan administrators, money transmitters, import and export companies and others that I have spoken with, that had previously disapproved our proposals, are now very interested.\n\nGiven the size of the Mexican cross-border payments market (almost $775,000,000,000 USD in foreign trade payments, and more than $25,000,000,000 in remittances), what’s happening right now is much bigger than the possibility of an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the USA. The regulation over our activities might open the door to foreign trade multinational corporations, financial institutions such as money transmitters, hedge funds, insurance institutions and others to use our platform to exchange currency and perform cross-border payments more efficiently.\nNow consider the Pension Plans Administrators in Mexico (AFORES). This institution has assets under management in excess of 4,004,702,000,000 MXN (about $215,306,559,139 USD). Some pension plan administrators have started to expand their horizon of investments, given the bad performance they all had in the last few months. Some have discovered bitcoin’s great performance over the years, but could not justify taking positions in the market… until now.\n\nThe new regulation will change the game.\n\nHow do you think Mexico’s new bill will affect bitcoin?

After April 23rd the company’s customers will be using a multi-signature controlled wallet for bitcoin and litecoin holdings.\nThe other two top bitcoin exchanges in China, Huobi and BTCC have recently told the public that all bitcoin exchanges in China are adhering to new regulatory policies and withdrawals should commence after the upgrades are finished. Huobi explains in their most recent announcement stating;\n\nOnce approved by the regulatory body, you can resume your digital currency business. Please pay attention to the official announcement from Huobi for when withdrawals will be granted.\n\nYoung Traders in China Have Been Making Big Money Trading Bitcoin\n27-year old Huai Yang says he makes 1 million yuan a month trading bitcoins.\nA recent report has also detailed that young bitcoin traders in China have been making a lucrative living trading the decentralized cryptocurrency. For instance, Huai Yang, a 27-year old living in Beijing says he is making 1m yuan per month trading bitcoins. Yang has been involved with cryptocurrency for quite some time but has been trading bitcoin for a living over the past six months. “I want a more splendid life,” explains the Chinese bitcoin trader.  \nAnother Chinese trader named Chenxing explains how he quit his government engineering job to trade bitcoin this year. During a good month, Chenxing pockets about five BTC but quickly converts it to yuan. Chenxing details the bitcoin environment in Beijing is growing, and he expects the cryptocurrency phenomenon to continue to prosper in China.\nLocalbitcoins Continues to Capture the Lion’s Share of Chinese Bitcoin Trading\nThe Chinese traders highlighted in the report didn’t seem too concerned with the PBOC’s recent regulatory actions. Meanwhile, Bitcoin proponents have noticed a significant influx of traders moving to over-the-counter (OTC) and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms like Localbitcoins. The P2P trading platform continues to see record volumes within the country. However, some Chinese traders have been afraid of police investigations and fraudsters on Localbitcoins.\nLocalbitcoin volumes in China continue to grow.\nFor now, OTC markets and Localbitcoins trades are the only options for big cryptocurrency traders in China, while the entire world wonders when Chinese exchanges will resume withdrawals.\nWhat do you think about the situation in China concerning bitcoin exchanges?

    "text": "\n A week following a lawsuit filed against Wells Fargo for suspending its U.S. dollar transfers, Bitfinex has withdrawn its lawsuit. Few believed that Bitfinex had a chance against Wells Fargo, which acted as the company’s correspondent bank.\nAlso read: Bitfinex Sues Wells Fargo Over Wire Transfer Suspension\nLawsuit Withdrawn\nBitfinex’s parent company, Ifinex, originally filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo & Company and Wells Fargo Bank on Wednesday April 5, for suspending its outgoing U.S. dollar wire transfers. Other plaintiffs in the suit were Tether Limited and Ifinex’s subsidiaries, BFXNA Inc and BFXWW Inc. They requested a jury trial for the case and were seeking “a preliminary and permanent injunction” against Wells Fargo in addition to compensatory damages in excess of $75,000 and any additional relief the court may deem fair.\nA week later, on Tuesday, the four plaintiffs filed a “notice of voluntary dismissal” with the District Court of Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, which effectively withdraws the lawsuit. The four plaintiffs “voluntarily dismiss without prejudice” the action against Wells Fargo, the court document reads, noting that:\n\nThis notice of voluntary dismissal is being filed with the Court before service by defendants of either an answer or a motion for summary judgment.\n\nLittle Chance of Success\nAt the time of writing, Bitfinex has not issued a statement as to why the lawsuit was withdrawn.\nHowever, some in the community believe the company stood very little chance against Wells Fargo. One Reddit user wrote: “Wells Fargo will argue that Bitfinex has no standing for the suit; its banking relation can use a different correspondent.” Another user wrote: “they [Bitfinex] will lose the lawsuit because 1) they have no standing, 2) banks are allowed to discriminate against wire transfers (see operation Choke Point).” Furthermore, the user questioned why Bitfinex did not have multiple banking partners, and suggested the company should use their resources to find a better correspondent banking partner instead of wasting time on “a lawsuit they know they will lose.”\nA Bitfinex representative responded to the Reddit thread, stating: “we work diligently to foster these relationships and develop new ones as a matter of routine”, adding that they have other options to be explored. “We have alternative channels available to us and are working on processing withdrawals at a delayed pace due to the operational overhead involved,” he added.\nThe problem of large banks discontinuing correspondent banking relationships with smaller banks is not an uncommon one. Banks can stop doing business with any bank in any country “because the compliance costs are too high or because the risk profile of the entity it is dealing with, is too high and not manageable”, according to a World Bank’s report on the decline in correspondent banking. Banks cannot be forced to continue correspondent banking relationships if they claim the risks are too high.\nThroughout the whole ordeal, Bitfinex has assured customers that their funds are not frozen by Wells Fargo, which is only acting as a correspondent bank.\nDo you think Bitfinex did the right thing by withdrawing the lawsuit?

    "text": "  \n\n On Monday, Chinese publication 8Btc posted a translation of a document that contained supposedly leaked “rectification guidelines” for bitcoin exchanges. “It’s the first time the document that’s given rise to the regulatory storm on bitcoin exchanges was exposed to the public,” according to the publication.\nAlso read: Major Chinese Exchanges to Postpone the Return of Withdrawals\nState Council’s Plan\nThe State Council is the chief administrative authority of China, chaired by the Premier and includes the heads of each governmental department and agency. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is one of the 35 departments and agencies constituting the State Council.\nOn October 13, 2016, the State Council released to the public “the Plan to Implement Special Rectification Work on Internet Finance Risks.”\nThe leaked document references the October implementation plan by the State Council (No. 21) as well as a notice by the PBOC and 17 other ministries (No. 281) published in December last year. It then states that:\n\nRectification work is conducted on bitcoin exchanges.\n\n‘Rectification Guidelines’ for Bitcoin Exchanges\nThe leaked document has 10 sections. The images of the original document can be found on Hexun.com, one of China’s largest financial information portals. They were reportedly first posted by a Wechat user. “This guideline applies to all bitcoin trading platforms that are found across the country,” the first part of the document reads. It continues:\n\nThe purpose is to crack down and abolish illegal financial operations on bitcoin exchanges, to maintain the order of bitcoin market, to prevent financial risks and to protect investors’ interests.\n\nRectification guideline document, posted on Hexun.com\nIf the leaked document is authentic, local regulators are supposed to take the lead in the rectification work, with the help of the local branch of the People’s Bank. They are to perform on-site inspections, put forward recommendations, and submit progress reports regularly.\nDepending on the outcome of the inspection, bitcoin exchanges may be required to stop fiat and bitcoin lending businesses; charge transaction fees; suspend bitcoin withdrawals; establish a sound anti-money laundering system; and conduct business in line with legal requirements.\n“The document confirms that the suspension of bitcoin withdrawals is a direct order from the authority,” 8Btc inferred.\nRegular progress reports include details of “the basic situation of the trading platform, issues found in the preliminary investigation, issues to be further identified, an action plan for future rectification, rectification summary of exchanges within the jurisdiction,” the publication translates.\nNegative List of Rules\nA section in the leaked document is dedicated to rules that bitcoin exchanges must follow. In March, Bitcoin.com reported on a similar list of prohibited items imposed on bitcoin exchanges, published by Caixin publication. Below is the new set of rules outlined in the leaked document.\n1. Do not engage in fiat and bitcoin lending.\n2. Transaction fees must not be zero.\n3. Do not engage in money laundry.\n4. Do not violate relevant regulatory requirements on foreign exchange management.\n5. Do not engage in illegal payment business.\n6. Do not engage in business operation beyond the scope stated on the business license.\n7. Do not violate industrial and commercial advertising and other laws and regulations.\n8. Do not violate laws and regulations of national securities and futures.\nInspection Checklist\nIn addition, the guidelines detail some areas which bitcoin exchanges are inspected. For each exchange platform, the inspector must check several key areas and any other items that may come up. Some of them are outlined below.\nFirst, the exchange’s basic business information needs to be verified, including its registered capital, operating entity, shareholder structure, and related businesses. Second, specific details of its operations need to be disclosed, including the amount of deposit and withdrawal from 2016 to present date of 2017, the amount and quantity of transactions, rates and fees and its bitcoin trading model.\nThird, the inspector must determine whether the exchange has violated any relevant provisions as an exchange platform such as the use of standardized contracts and whether the order book is matched electronically. Fourth, it must be determined if the exchange is engaged in illegal financial businesses such as offering margin loans, futures trading, payment, exchange and other services without authorization.\nFifth, the inspector must determine if the exchange has a sound anti-money laundering system. This includes establishing customer identity information and transaction record storage system as well as establishing a system for reporting on large and suspicious transactions.\nIn addition, the inspector must also verify the exchange’s procedure regarding customers’ funds including determining the balance of the funds, the use of the funds, and the establishment of a third-party custody system.\nWhile the inspections may be exhaustive and the requirements extensive, the necessary work may already be done. According to the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the rectification work “is planned to be finished in March 2017,” the Commission said when the implementation plan was released in October last year.\nWhat do you think of these regulatory guidelines for Chinese bitcoin exchanges?

    "text": "\n The Bank of Korea joins the growing list of central banks researching virtual currencies like bitcoin. The South Korean bank has just published a research paper that compares cryptocurrencies to traditional fiat currencies issued by governments.\nAlso read: Korea Steadily Becoming a Cryptocurrency and Fintech Hub \nSouth Korea’s Central Bank Researches the Relationship Between Bitcoin and Fiat\nResearchers from Seoul’s Hongik University and members of the Bank of Korea (BOK) have released a paper called “Crowding out in a Dual Currency Regime.” The paper written by Kihoon Hong, Kyounghoon Park, and Jongmin Yu details how cryptocurrencies and fiat monetary systems could collaborate in the future in what the authors call a “dual currency regime.”  \n“The rise of cryptocurrencies could have a significant impact on our monetary system as they are privately issued currencies, thus not regulated by central banks,” explains the BOK research paper’s authors.\n\nThe recent emergence of digital currency opens up a new type of dual currency regime in which digital currency, which has no intrinsic value and a government-issued fiat currency coexist. One of the well-known examples of privately-issued digital currencies is Bitcoin.\n\nThe Dual Currency Regime \nIn essence, the report states that traditional fiat systems can coexist with privately issued digital currencies like bitcoin. The paper reports that the relationship between the use of fiat currency and that of digital currency demand can change with cost variances.\n“High costs of using fiat currency increase the demand for digital currency,” details the BOK research paper. “Similarly, high costs of using digital currency relative to fiat currency raise the demand for fiat currency. In a world of imperfect currencies with uncertain costs associated with the use of a currency, it is unlikely that the relative costs of using digital currency will be low enough to drive out and accordingly crowd out fiat currency entirely.”\n\nOur results rather suggest that the threshold of equating the demand for fiat currency with that for digital currency will allow the co-existence of both currencies.\n\nCryptocurrency Interest Continues to Grow in South Korea\nBitcoin has made a significant impact in South Korea as the country captures the fifth-highest bitcoin trading volume worldwide. Last November the Korea Exchange launched its blockchain-based Korea Startup Market (KSM) while the Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) has talked about regulating  bitcoin this year.\nThe latest research paper from the BOK reveals the country’s officials are very interested in cryptocurrencies. The authors say they hope the research provided will help South Korean officials and regulators understand the new technology. The paper goes on to state that future research can theoretically and empirically observe the impact of digital currencies and the South Korean economy. Alongside this, the central bank’s researchers say they may work on a paper that covers three types of coexisting currencies in the near future.\n“Further, we may attempt to extend our model to a triple currency regime with private-issued digital currency, central-bank-issued digital currency, and fiat currency,” the paper concludes.\nWhat do you think about the Bank of Korea cryptocurrency research paper?

    "title": " Recently, the Bcoin team released the specifications and particulars for launching extension blocks for a blockchain protocol upgrade. They",
    "text": "\n Recently, the Bcoin team released the specifications and particulars for launching extension blocks for a blockchain protocol upgrade. They have now nearly completed implementing these extension blocks. Bitpay’s CEO Stephen Pair responded with an article on April 24 saying that Bitpay would be willing to test these “secondary blocks” on a testnet.  \nAlso read: Bcoin Developers Plan to Test Scaling Concept ‘Extension Blocks’\nPair said, “The bcoin team has released specifications and working code for the developer community to critique. At Bitpay, we think this idea of extension blocks holds a lot of promise, and we intend to participate in its technical evaluation”.\nThis news of testing extension blocks comes at a time of great divide within the Bitcoin community over whether Segwit should be activated. Pair suggests that extension blocks could solve the problem because these “secondary blocks” act as a non-contentious hardfork. In a previous article, Pair said that the communities need to avoid initiating a contentious hardfork at all costs. He said:\n“One very important challenge we must resolve is how to successfully upgrade Bitcoin in a safe, deliberate and non-contentious manner. And we must be able to upgrade Bitcoin because no organism can live in its own waste products.”\n\nHow Secondary Blocks are Non-Contentious; Pair’s Three Step Formulation\nThis “secondary block” or “extension block” upgrade is non-contentious and will disallow Bitcoin to wallow in its own excrement, because of the manner in which it solves the problem of filled block sizes. In Pair’s previous article, he outlines a three step outline on how extension blocks could be implemented. He said the nodes will acknowledge new rules for these secondary blocks, and thus they will start accepting data.\n“In this step, nodes begin upgrading to support the new rules. Nodes will validate and relay valid data that can be included in the secondary block (imagine some new form of transaction, but it could really be any kind of data). These nodes will not relay data considered invalid according to the new rules.”\nIn phase two, Pair suggests that a second soft fork is performed. However, he mentions instead of adding new rules to the protocol, old blocks will be “deprecated.” This means that transactions will no longer be allowed in the old block.\nFinally, in phase three, the protocol will start to shed its old skin and stop rolling around in its own filth. Pair clarified this step, “After the soft fork that deprecates use of the original block has activated, all transactions and data will be in the new secondary block. At this point we can schedule a hard fork that simply drops the old block and adopts the secondary block as the primary block structure.”\nPair seems confident that the “secondary block” or “extension block” plan is the way to go for a non-contentious fork and upgrade of the bitcoin protocol. Of course, others disagree.\nDo you think a “secondary block” upgrade is the solution to the scaling dilemma? Let us know in the comments below.

    "text": "\n The price of bitcoin has seen a spontaneous rise during the last week of April as the cryptocurrency’s fiat value has climbed to new highs. Over the course of the afternoon and evening of April 27 bitcoin’s price spiked to an all-time high of US$1360 across global exchanges. \nAlso read: Japanese City Accepts Bitcoin Donations\nBitcoin Price Weekly View: April’s All Time Highs\nBitcoin markets are currently in an uncharted price territory as the digital asset once again surpassed its all-time high jumping in value 10 percent over the past 24 hours. The price has dipped a touch during the morning of April 28 as the global average on exchanges is roughly $1330 per BTC at press time. Bitcoin’s overall market capitalization is also higher than ever before as it currently captures a market share of $21.3 billion. Trading volume is also substantial as over $500 million worth of BTC has been traded daily over the past three days.\n\nThe weekly view and technical indicators suggest the bull run is not over but could see a hiccup in the short term. Bitcoin’s 100 Simple Moving Average SMA is still well above the 200 SMA trendline which means the ascending climb upwards may continue over the long term. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) one can assume that buyers are still playing their cards and may continue to prop the price upwards. However, as we reported in our past three market updates the Stochastic indicator readout shows that sellers could pull the price down at any given time. Furthermore, market data from Bitfinex and traders on the trading forum Trading View show a lot more ‘short’ positions than ‘long’ positions.\nTrading View trader Nixholas predicts a bull rally ahead for BTC/USD markets. “Three drives now, cup and handle broken. With CNBC and the other major news reporters coming into shill us, $1.5K won’t even be a problem,” explains Nixholas.\nCryptocurrency Markets Rise Capturing a $33 Billion Capitalization   \nOverall Cryptocurrency Market Cap: $33,812,543,483 / 24h Vol: $1,085,012,433 / BTC Dominance: 63.1% on April 28, 2017.\nOverall cryptocurrency markets with altcoins included have also reached an all-time high of $33.6 billion USD at the time of writing. The second largest market capitalization held by Ethereum has skyrocketed to $5.7 billion over the past 24 hours. One ether is roughly $63, and Ethereum markets are trading a daily average of over $300 million in trade volume. The third runner-up Ripple (XRP) has seen a spike, as well, as the price has risen to over 4 cents per XRP.\nLitecoin (LTC) markets continue to do well, after the network  recently locked-in Segregated Witness activation. At the moment LTC is over $14 per token with a $750 million dollar market capitalization. Dash has seen an increase too as the price stayed stable at $70 over the past two weeks. The price per Dash is now $78 per coin seeing a 6 percent price increase over the past 24 hours.\nThe other top ten cryptocurrency contenders are also seeing price rises, probably due to bitcoin’s ascending value. This includes price rises from Ethereum Classic ($4), NEM ($0.04), Monero ($21), Augur ($14), and Maidsafecoin ($0.23). Golem, Zcash, and PIVX are still trying to enter the top ten with 8-15 percent increases this week.\nSpeculators Look Towards the ETF, Japan, and Bitfinex USD Issues, but No One Really Knows Why the Price Is Rising\n\nBitcoin proponents seem happy with the price increase, but some people are skeptical due to seeing considerably higher price spreads between Bitfinex and other USD bitcoin exchanges. Mainstream media is giving bitcoin coverage because of the price spike and are attributing the increase to the SEC reviewing the Coin bitcoin ETF again. Other news outlets say that Japan’s recent bitcoin payment legalization law has also propelled the price upwards as well. Many are unsure of where the boost is coming from, and a lot of the uncertainty is stemming from the $100 difference between Bitfinex and the global average.\nBear Scenario: Bitcoin’s fiat value has dipped during the early morning hours of April 28 since reaching its all-time high. A deeper correction could continue leading to prices below the $1300 mark. Order books across popular exchanges show current support looks very healthy in the $1250 per BTC price range. ‘Short’ positions are also starting to increase as the price has reached new territory.\nBull Scenario: If bitcoin breaks current resistance the path upwards could easily trend past the $1400 range this week and even towards $1500. Buyers have control over the market and SMA and RSI technical indicators show the price ascent should continue. The current price territory is highly psychological, and there will be many breaks and scalps in between. Intra-range and day traders will likely find price sweet spots over the course of the next week.\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin’s price trends at the moment?

    "text": "\n The price of bitcoin has escalated once again to higher levels, surpassing the $1400 range on a few exchanges. As bitcoin’s successful run continues, many are starting to wonder — How high will the price go?\nAlso read: News Outlets and Journalists Are Being Threatened By Onecoin Lawyers\nBitcoin Outperforms Traditional Assets as the Price Continues to Climb to New Heights\nBitcoin’s value is rising to levels unseen before as the decentralized currency now captures a $23 billion market capitalization. The first quarter of 2017 has been good for bitcoin as the price has remained above 4-digits consistently for most of the year. Furthermore, the price per bitcoin has outperformed every fiat currency in existence and surpassed the spot price of one troy ounce of gold as well. People are beginning to realize bitcoin is a safe haven for failing economies, an escape from capital controls, and a digital asset like no other.\n\nThe Rise of Ethereum and Overall Cryptocurrency Markets\nBitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency performing so well. In fact, a great majority of the top twenty token assets according to Coinmarketcap.com have seen significant price rises. The forerunner of all these alternative tokens, Ethereum is second largest market compared to bitcoin and is capturing quite a bit of value very fast. Ethereum has reached an all time high as well reaching $82 per ETH on April 30. Alongside this, Ethereum has amassed a whopping $7 billion dollar market capitalization in mere days.\nMeanwhile, traditional markets like the NYSE, are floundering compared to the exciting growth of cryptocurrency markets. Overall cryptocurrency markets are now approaching $40 billion in net worth as many altcoins are performing like never before. Many spectators believe digital assets like bitcoin have moved from being a fringe technology to the mainstream this year.\nThe Honey Badger Just Doesn’t Care\nFurthermore, bitcoin has managed to shrug off negative news more easily than ever before. Last summer’s Bitfinex incident shocked markets but steadily rebounded after the hack. The news stemming from Chinese bitcoin exchanges this past January suspending withdrawals also gave the price a little hiccup, but subsequently, the BTC price regained its value. Moreover, just recently Bitfinex has announced exchange issues with banking partners and halted USD withdrawals. Once again the ‘Honey Badger’ of money just doesn’t care, and the price has continued to climb.\nQuite a few speculators and forecasters believe the price will test the $1500-2000 range this year. So far bitcoin is up over 200 percent looking at the year-over-year average and proving to be an unstoppable monetary force.\nGlobal exchange volumes and bitcoin’s fiat value continues to climb.\nExponential Global Adoption\nThere have been many reasons to why the price of bitcoin is continuing to rise. Some are attributing the demand to countries like Japan, India, and China which are all experiencing exponential bitcoin adoption. Speculators are also pointing at failing centrally planned economies, government’s fiat manipulation, and demonetization, and capital controls stopping individual citizens from moving wealth. Furthermore, research stemming from the Cambridge University study reveals the bitcoin economy is bigger than ever before and continues to grow.\nGlobal Localbitcoins volumes reach all-time highs.\nIt’s exciting to see the bitcoin ecosystem doing so well, especially after the Mt Gox scandal, 2014’s bearish decline, the Bitfinex hack, and the many other negative headlines that seemed to try and slow bitcoin down. The bitcoin train continues to chug forward proving to be the most resilient peer-to-peer currency this world has ever seen.\nWhat do you think about bitcoin’s performance?

On May 3rd the price per BTC hit another record high of US$1518 on Bitstamp and even higher across other global exchanges.\nAlso read: Mexico’s Government Officials Discuss Plans to Regulate Bitcoin\nBitcoin Price Soars Past $1400 and Into the $1500 Range\nMany bitcoiners have been celebrating the spring months of April and May, as the past few weeks has seen all-time price highs for bitcoin. Cryptocurrency proponents were quite pleased when BTC’s fiat value rose above the $1400 mark and were subsequently surprised when $1500 came quickly after. At press time the price per BTC had reached $1547 after dipping into the $1490s several times.\n\nWeekly View\nShort term technical indicators and order books show there is substantial resistance above the $1500 range at the time of writing. However, the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is still maintaining well above the longer term 200 SMA showing the bull market engines are still at full throttle. Although the Relative Strength Index and Stochastic indicators show we may be in overbought territory and things could get choppy. Nevertheless, bitcoin volume is strong capturing roughly $300-500 million per day this week as the decentralized cryptocurrency now commands a $24.2 billion market.\nBitcoin In the News\nNo one knows the primary reason why bitcoin’s price is rising so fast. There could be various things to consider that are attributing to bitcoin’s soaring market value. Mainstream media has put out a few articles highlighting bitcoin’s increase in value which could be enticing investor interest. Countries like India, Japan, and China have continued to show significant demand as global interest in bitcoin stemming from many regions has been at an all-time high.\nFurthermore many governments in areas such as Mexico, India, and other countries look as though they may legalize and regulate the digital currency. The approval from worldwide leaders may be giving bitcoin markets positive reinforcement, a far different approach than their warnings in the past. Overall the fact of the matter is it’s hard not to notice bitcoin’s performance and adoption growth over the previous year. High prices, positive news, and global interest continues to bring more users into the world of cryptocurrency for various reasons.\nBitcoin price lifetime chart. Bitstamp BTC/USD 5/03/17\nCelebrating Record Highs as Japanese Trading Volume Continues to Surge\nAs usual bitcoin community members are thrilled to see the decentralized currency do so well. People have been celebrating all over social media with tweets, price ticker pictures, and their favorite bitcoin memes. Overall the past twenty-four hours has been exciting as the trading day began in the low $1440s.\nThe heaviest trading region has been Japan as the country has captured a majority of the global trade volume. According to CNBC, the Japanese exchange Bitflyer is seeing massive demand. This is also followed by strong trading volumes stemming from the U.S. and China as well.\nBear Scenario: The price of $1500 per BTC is a highly psychological mark, and it will take time to find ground above this range. According to order books across various global exchanges and depth charts, there’s strong support between the $1400-1450 territory. There’s sure to be plenty of volatile action for intra-range moves and day traders looking for quick dips.\nBull Scenario: At press time bitcoin is wiping off the sweat from breaking $1500 and trying to hold its position. If buyers keep up the action and bitcoin breaks current resistance the path to $1600 could very well be achieved. Bulls are controlling the market and keeping the momentum going on the upside. The question is — How much longer can they keep it up?\nWhat do you think about the price of bitcoin breaking $1500? Where do you see the price going from here?

Two government officials have recently revealed some details of how the digital currency will be regulated, according to local publications.\nAlso read: Mexico’s New Bill Could Be a Game Changer for Bitcoin\nMexico’s Plans to Regulate Bitcoin\nJose Bernardo Gonzalez, Head of the Mexican Finance Ministry’s Banking, Securities and Savings Unit, said that Bitcoin exists in a free market and cannot be controlled, El Universal reports. In statements made to the publication, he explained how the laws would allow the central bank to regulate bitcoin buyers and sellers, stating that (loosely translated):\n\nWhat we are trying to regulate are the sellers and buyers of this type of assets [bitcoin] to third parties, but not the virtual asset itself.\n\nHe further clarified that the regulators would ensure there are “certain rules to prevent money laundering, user protection and so on.” Specifically, they “would check that these assets are sufficiently liquid and would define the operating characteristics with which financial intermediaries or fintech companies can offer these assets to the public,” he described.\nFeedback from the Finance Community\nThe initiative proposed by the government to modernize Mexico’s fintech sector includes a section about Bitcoin. It was recently presented to the financial sector and was well received, according to Gonzalez. Traditional banks and brokerage firms in Mexico provided feedback and suggestions. Many are positive and look forward to Bitcoin being regulated, he told El Universal.\n“They are seeing that there is complementarity between traditional institutions and the fintech sector,” he recalled.\nIn a recent Senate appearance, the Governor of the Bank of Mexico, Agustin Carstens, talked about this fintech initiative as well. “The goal is how to take advantage of technological innovation that can reduce costs and increase the reach of the financial system, but everything must be in an environment of prudence and security towards users,” he said. The governor also disclosed that he is confident the initiative will be approved this year.\nCentral Bank Experimenting with Bitcoin\nCarstens also recently revealed that the central bank has been running “very low scale” tests with Bitcoin to learn how it works, Forbes reports. He explained that prior to regulating Bitcoin, the bank needs to familiarize itself with the digital currency and its technology. In addition, the publication wrote:\n\nThe objective of the operations is also to outline an eventual regulation of virtual currencies, for which Banxico will take its time and find the best international practices.\n\nAgustin Carstens\nThe governor has some concerns, however. “The worrying thing is that periodically there are technological, hacking and theft problems, and that makes us very nervous. Yes, we have to be fully assured of technological integrity, well armored, and not expose the public,” he conveyed.\nMoreover, he detailed how the central bank will make sure that financial authorities are properly set up to observe and ensure that “the technological support is solid and robust, in order to avoid risks for users.” Nonetheless, more testing is needed first, he told Forbes.\nWhat do you think of Mexico’s plans to regulate Bitcoin?

    "text": "\n On May 4, the New York-based cryptocurrency exchange Gocelery suspended deposits and withdrawals without any explanation. Cryptocurrency investors who use the platform to invest in bitcoin and altcoins are showing concern over the announcement across social media. \nAlso read: Las Vegas Strip Club Aims to Use Cryptocurrency for Daily Operations\nA Small U.S. Based Cryptocurrency Exchange Suspends Services\nThe cryptocurrency platform Gocelery, otherwise known as “Celery,” is a subsidiary of Btx Trader and was established in 2014. The trading platform is operated by Ilya Subkhankulov and Divya Thakur, who have claimed since the company started that 90 percent of customer funds were held in cold storage. Since 2014, the exchange has operated with little complaints and has also offered customers using Canadian bank accounts zero fees for transactions.\nDuring bitcoin’s climatic price rise to the $1600s, Gocelery.com users were notified that the company had suspended deposits and withdrawals until further notice. The trading platform did not give any reasons why they ceased offering these services but informed customers via Twitter and Celery’s update page. The trading platform announced its decision at 9:45 am on May 4, stating:  \n\nAll withdrawals, deposits, and orders are currently suspended. Please refer to this page for all further updates.\n\nIs this a Trending Issue Among Global Exchanges?\nBecause the price is so high and a few other exchanges across the globe have also halted deposits and withdrawals, Celery’s announcement has caused concern. For instance, this past January, Chinese exchanges suspended withdrawals after the country’s central bank began inspecting them.\nFollowing China’s exchange issues, the popular exchange Bitfinex also suspended fiat withdrawals, causing bitcoiners to worry. However, the reasons behind these particular suspensions were revealed to the public. Both Chinese exchanges and Bitfinex have not reinstated withdrawals at the time of writing.\n\nCelery’s owner, Btx Trader, has been involved within the cryptocurrency environment since 2013. Btx trader is also a corporate branch of another company, as the firm is a wholly-owned subsidiary of WPCS International Inc. For now, customers believe they will just have to wait until Celery gives the public further information via their update page.\nBad Memories\nThe news of various exchanges suspending deposit and withdrawal services has been haunting bitcoiners with memories of Mt Gox. Celery’s suspension is yet another example of an exchange having issues in 2017, but the problem for customers is the company’s silence.\nWhat do you think about Gocelery suspending deposits and withdrawals?

    "text": "\n On May 4th, 2017 bitcoiners were not only celebrating Star Wars day but also bitcoin’s galactic rise to US$1620 across global exchanges. However, an hour following the climatic spike bitcoin’s value took a dive dropping to a low of $1445. Since then bitcoin repositioned its trajectory back to the $1570 range, before plunging yet again.\nAlso read: Las Vegas Strip Club Aims to Use Cryptocurrency for Daily Operations\nMay the Fourth be With You \nThursday was an eventful day for bitcoin in terms of market value as the currency experienced some significant volatility during the trading day. The day opened with BTC trading at $1540 per token and rose to a high above the $1600 mark mid-afternoon. Moreover, nearly every altcoin market followed suit with bitcoin’s increase as Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and others experienced upward swings in value.\n\nAround 3 PM eastern standard, bitcoin’s fiat value dropped well over a $100 per BTC in less than ten minutes. Another ten minutes later the digital asset bounced back to the $1520 range after hitting $1490. However following the small bounce back bitcoin’s price took another dive to a low of $1445 across many global exchanges.\nThere weren’t too many reasons behind the price drop as many assumed it was just a correction. However, the dip in value had coincidently occurred at the same time a relatively small U.S. trading exchange Gocelery suspended deposits and withdrawals.\nWeekly Headlines\nWhile many bitcoin proponents were focused on the rising price this week, there were also many interesting headlines. For instance, Bitpay announced a partnership with Bitmain Technologies in a “multi-million dollar agreement,” as the firm detailed it will be assisting with open source mining research and development. \nAnother interesting happening this past week was when Jon Matonis joined the Craig Wright associated Nchain firm. Furthermore, the Australian who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto was recently interviewed by Christoph Bergmann revealing some interesting commentary about bitcoin’s creation, current development, why the 21 million cap was chosen, why Adam Back was credited in the white paper, and his opinion of the block size limit. New discussions on who Craig Wright is and what he is doing has surfaced across many social media platforms over the past 48-hours. \nMeanwhile, mainstream media news outlets such as Bloomberg, Time, Forbes, and CNBC have been highlighting bitcoin’s price rise in their headlines. Most all of the reports discuss Japan’s current relationship with bitcoin and the country’s increasing trade volume. Additionally, bitcoiner’s have been watching a few other governments like Mexico, for instance, prepare legislation similar to Japan’s recent legalization and tax consumption status.\nOverall Cryptocurrency Markets Across the Board are Rising in Value Exponentially\nEvery single cryptocurrency in the top ten largest market capitalizations has seen price spikes over the past 72 hours. The second largest valued cryptocurrency capitalization is held by Ethereum which is currently commanding a market cap of $9 billion at the time of writing. Ether (ETH) is trading at $99 per token seeing a 14 percent increase during the morning of May 5. Ripple (XRP) has jumped quite a bit as each XRP has doubled in price over the past 24-hours. One XRP is currently 10 cents, and the Ripple’s market cap now captures $3.6 billion. \nLitecoin is also rising, and it probably is due to its recent Segwit implementation coupled with Coinbase adding the cryptocurrency to its market options. Litecoin (LTC) has finally crossed the billion dollar market cap line with $1.3 billion, and each LTC is currently worth $27. Dash has seen a mediocre rise but nonetheless is trading at $103 per token. Other notable increases in the top ten include Ethereum Classic (ETC) $7, NEM $0.07, Monero (XMR) $29, Golem (GNT) $0.26, and Augur (REP) $17. Overall all 717 cryptocurrencies are valued at an all-time high of $46 billion dollars.\nEven though bitcoin’s price took a significant drop on May 4, the market is licking its wounds and rebounding. Moreover, for the first time in history bitcoin’s 24-hour trade volume has crossed $1 billion USD worth of bitcoins traded daily. Currently, bitcoin’s price is slowly rising back up towards the $1600 range, and it’s anyone’s guess what will happen next.\nWhat do you think about the price of bitcoin and various altcoins over the past few days?

    "title": " After the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected two Bitcoin ETFs in March, Barry Silbert has stepped up",
    "text": "\n After the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected two Bitcoin ETFs in March, Barry Silbert has stepped up his efforts to increase the chance of the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) being approved. On Thursday, he filed an amendment to the BIT’s registration statement with the SEC which includes two major changes.\nAlso read: SEC Rejects Rule Change for Bitcoin ETF\nDouble Offering Size\nSilbert originally filed the S-1 registration statement form with the SEC on January 20 for the BIT, sponsored by his company, Grayscale Investments LLC. The proposed offering at the time was $500 million. He filed the first amendment to the BIT’s S-1 in March but did not alter the size of the proposed IPO.\nThen, on Thursday, Silbert filed Amendment No. 2 with the Commission. It revises the BIT’s proposed offering to $1 billion, indicating his confidence in the demand for the BIT.\nIn comparison, Coin ETF’s offering was $100 million and Solidx’s offering was only $1 million.\nEnlisting Big Financial Institutions\nIn addition to raising the proposed offering, the BIT’s Amendment No. 2 lists three large financial institutions as authorized participants. According to the amendment:\n\nThe Trust [BIT] has engaged Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, KCG Americas LLC and Wedbush Securities as Authorized Participants. Additional Authorized Participants may be added at any time, subject to the discretion of the Sponsor.\n\nPreviously, the BIT shares were distributed solely by Genesis Global Trading Inc. These private placement transactions were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. After the IPO, if the SEC approves, the BIT shares will only be distributed by the authorized participants listed above and no longer by Genesis Global Trading Inc. Xapo remains the BIT’s only custodian.\nAuthorized participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets of the BIT’s shares, according to the filing. “Authorized participants may act for their own accounts or as agents for broker-dealers, custodians and other securities market participants that wish to create or redeem baskets.”\nThe two Bitcoin ETFs which the SEC already rejected did not name any specific authorized participants in their S-1 filings or amendments.\nChance of SEC Approval\nThe SEC has rejected two Bitcoin ETFs; one on March 10 and the other on March 28. The first decision is currently being reviewed by the Commission following Bats BZX Exchange’s petition for a review.\nHowever, the decision to disapprove proposed rule changes for both Bitcoin ETFs concerns the nature of Bitcoin itself and of the Bitcoin market, not company-specific filings. The SEC cites the reasons for rejecting the listing and trading of Bitcoin ETFs as:\n\nFirst, the exchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity [bitcoin] or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets [bitcoin markets] must be regulated.\n\nUnless the outcome of the SEC’s review changes the above, most people in the Bitcoin community believe that no Bitcoin ETF will be approved in the near future. The Commission has designated May 10 as the date it would make a decision on the BIT’s proposed rule change. However, this deadline could be extended further.\nDo you think Barry Silbert can get his Bitcoin Investment Trust approved? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "title": " Owning and operating a money transmitter service in the U.S. is “illegal” unless it is registered with State agencies.",
    "text": "\n Owning and operating a money transmitter service in the U.S. is “illegal” unless it is registered with State agencies. Unfortunately, this is also true if one uses Bitcoin to exchange for fiat currency. Bitcoin is not immune from State or Federal laws regulating the flow of money, and agents can track bitcoin transfers over the blockchain.\nAlso read: Bitcoin Advocates Prepare to Fight the California Bitlicense\nThese facts have become more apparent in the last few years as at least 4 people have been arrested and charged with financial crimes related to the “illegal” transmission of Bitcoin.\nAll the cases involved individuals allegedly exchanging Bitcoin for a fee. Some of the individuals advertised these services online in a furtive or overt fashion. They were caught after local or federal agents began an investigation, and sometimes after the “suspects” transferred bitcoin to an undercover officer for a fee. However, sometimes there was not even an investigation, only suspicion and an ill-gotten warrant.\nRecent Cases of Bitcoin Transmitter Crimes\nMissouri Case\nIn a recently circulated case, a Missouri man pleaded guilty to conducting an unlicensed and unregulated money transmitter service. The man, Jason R. Klein, posted advertisements on the internet to exchange Bitcoin for cash. The Missouri attorneys office statement said,\nBetween Feb. 6, 2015, and July 27, 2016, Klein, acting with another, met with two undercover federal agents on numerous occasions to exchange bitcoin for cash. Today’s plea agreement cites five separate transactions in which money (ranging from $1,000 to $15,000) was exchanged in person for an electronic transfer of bitcoin. Each of the transactions included a fee that Klein or another person charged the undercover agents, for a total of $2,122 in fees.\nKlein is subject to receive a penalty of up to five years in prison without parole.\nArizona Case\nIn another recent case covered by Bitcoin.com, an Arizona man named Thomas Constanzo, AKA Morpheus, was accused of possibly running an illegal money transmitter service…but was only charged with possessing “60 cartridges of ammunition.” Some think this is more a politically-motivated charge, since alleged crimes of illegal money transmission were not leveled. A warrant for running a money transmitter service was issued alongside the arrest for the ammo cartridges.\n“A warrant signed by U.S. Magistrate Judge David Duncan sought evidence that Costanzo may have operated an “unlicensed money transmitting business,” engaged in illegal drug sales, and tried to hide any profits.”\nConstanzo was considered a “flight risk” and was not provided the opportunity for bail.\nOhio Case\nIn a more complex case, an Ohio man named Daniel Mercede was charged with using stolen credit card information to buy concert tickets and resell them for a profit. After a prolonged investigation involving a home search, cops learned of ongoing money transmitter crimes. Allegedly, agents figured out that Mercede was purchasing large quantities of Bitcoin from overseas exchanges and reselling them at a premium. An FBI article about the case explained what they found and the sentence they handed down,\n“Court records show Mercede wired funds to make daily purchases of $10,000 and $40,000 in bitcoin. Over six months beginning in August 2014, Mercede illegally converted or transmitted $1.4 million. He was sentenced on March 21 to more than six years in prison. The case represents one of the first convictions for what is believed to be an increasingly frequent crime—operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.”\nNew York Case\nIn a New York case that occurred between 2014 and 2015, a man on probation for transferring child pornography, named Richard Petix, pleaded guilty to running an “illegal money transmitting business” and “making false statements.”\nOn December 3, 2015, Petix conducted a bitcoin exchange with a federal agent in Buffalo, New York. He sent 37 bitcoins to the officer, worth about $13,000 at the time. He was also on probation, and allegedly lied about having access to the computer where the transaction occurred. The New York attorneys office summarized his activities,\n“Between August, 2014, and December 3, 2015, Petix conducted over 100 Bitcoin transactions wherein he transferred over $200,000 in bitcoins to customers both locally and across the United States. At least some of these customers then used the bitcoins to purchase controlled substances from dark net vendors. At no time during this period did Petix comply with federal money transmitting business registration requirements.” These cases represent a government crack down on the use of bitcoin to exchange cash for a fee, although in some cases the transmitter service was stumbled on by accident (Mercede) or not found at all (Constanzo).\nNeedless to say, government has become aggressive in regards to thwarting illicit use of Bitcoin by underground, black market actors. They are now willing to hand out warrants or conduct investigations even if the evidence is tentative, nonexistent, or amounts to a witch hunt.\nGovernments also have the tools and understanding to track bitcoin addresses and obtain computers that harbor wallets. Currently, it seems ill-advised for anyone to attempt to transfer bitcoin in exchange for cash. In the least, anyone interested in subverting government laws should acknowledge that Bitcoin is only pseudo-anonymous and digital currency trails can be traced.\nWith that said, government possessing authority to tell people how to spend their money is a controversial subject. Many have decried government assaults on these “criminals” as an attack on individual liberty, a person’s right to their property, and ability to spend their money how they see fit.\nDo you believe even more people will be arrested for operating “illegal” bitcoin exchanges in the near future? Do you believe people should be punished for spending their money as they see fit? Let us know in the comments section below. Images courtesy of Shutterstock. Need to calculate your bitcoin holdings?

    "text": "\n While people are watching bitcoin’s successful price upswing many are wondering — Where’s all the money coming from?\nAlso read: Bitcoin Price Goes Full Throttle Blasting Past $1500\nUSD, JPY, and CNY Markets Dominate Bitcoin Trade Volume\nBitcoin markets have been wild lately with massive trading volume as the price is higher than it’s ever been before. Currently, the price per bitcoin is coasting along at an average of roughly US$1550-60 with 24-hour global trade volume reaching $700 million across worldwide exchanges on May 4. \nGlobal 24-hour BTC trade volume tops $765 million.\nThroughout this time many bitcoin participants and spectators are curious to know who is trading the most bitcoin these days. Many news outlets are pointing to Japan as interest has increased significantly in the region. It’s also being said that Japanese trading is capturing the lion’s share of bitcoin daily trade volume. However at present JPY trading is roughly tied with USD bitcoin trade volume, and CNY numbers follow slightly behind.\n\nAccording to Coinmarketcap.com statistics between the U.S. exchanges such as GDAX, Bitstamp, Kraken, Bitfinex, and Gemini are showing USD/BTC trading at roughly $73 million over the past 24-hours. Japanese exchanges are also trading $73 million USD worth of JPY/BTC per day between Bitflyer, Coincheck, Zaif, and Quoine.\nVolume from China is a touch lower as traders see $45 million in daily trades with Huobi, BTCC, and Okcoin volumes. China was once the global leader in bitcoin trades in 2016 but that all changed when trading platforms halted withdrawals and added fees to every trade. Just behind China is Europe, as total percentages of overall Euro trading is around $31.4 million between three major European bitcoin exchanges.\nBitstamp BTC/USD, 24-hour trade volume, is roughly $20 million at press time.\nBitcoin Volumes: Things to Consider\nStatistics do show that USD and JPY trade volume is higher than ever before, but some believe these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt. For instance, when China dominated bitcoin markets it was because trading platforms allowed trading without fees which inflated CNY volumes drastically. Since the Chinese exchanges added fees BTC/CNY trade volumes in China have plummeted. One attractive benefit to Japanese bitcoin trading is the fact that exchange’s from the region do not charge fees per trade. This makes skeptics leery of Japanese bitcoin trading volume as JPY statistics may be inflated due to this reason.\nBiflyer JPY/BTC 24-hour trade volume shows $13 million USD worth of bitcoins traded at press time.\nSecondly, U.S. volumes are high, but that may have a lot to do with Bitfinex market volumes right now. Out of the $73 million in USD 24-hour trade volume, Bitfinex is capturing $30 million of that share at the time of writing. However Bitfinex prices are through the roof right now since the exchange suspended USD withdrawals. Currently, one bitcoin is trading for $1630 on the Bitfinex trading platform which is well above every other exchange that facilitates USD trades.\nAre These Top BTC Trading Countries Showing Bitcoin is On the Verge of Mainstream Success? \nNevertheless, people are focused heavily on Japan because the government just recently legalized bitcoin as a form of payment. Furthermore, the bitcoin exchanges Bitflyer and Coincheck hope to encourage thousands of merchants to adopt bitcoin by this summer. To add to all of that many institutional investors are seeing Japan as cryptocurrency hotspot and rumor has it many more exchanges plan on operating in the country.\nMainstream acceptance of bitcoin is also doing well in many other regions worldwide. In the U.S., China and Europe lawmakers are also preparing legislative guidelines for bitcoin use within each country as leaders see trade volumes and popularity has been rising consistently in these countries for well over a year.\nWhat do you think about the trade volumes in these countries?

    "text": "\n Since Japan started recognizing bitcoin as a method of payment, more Japanese are using the digital currency than expected. Bitcoin.com discussed this trend with Yuzo Kano, CEO of Bitflyer, the largest bitcoin exchange in Japan by volume.\nAlso read: Media Frenzy in Japan as Bic Camera Starts Accepting Bitcoin\nBitcoin Gaining Acceptance in Japan\nOn April 1, Japan started recognizing bitcoin as a method of payment, similar to prepaid cards and gift certificates. Since then, Bitcoin usage and awareness in Japan have been growing.\nAmong retailers that started accepting bitcoin in April were two Bic Camera stores. The Japanese consumer electronics giant partnered with Bitflyer to accept the digital currency. The news was heavily reported by mainstream media in Japan. Kano told Bitcoin.com:\n\nThe news that big retail shop Bic Camera started accepting bitcoin from this April was reported on many TV programs, newspapers and websites and this news made many people interested in Bitcoin.\n\nInterest in Bitcoin has spiked among merchants in Japan and many other retail stores are considering accepting the digital currency. “We are expecting that some large retail shops and e-commerce sites will introduce bitcoin payment within this year,” Kano conveyed, adding that “more and more to come in the next year.” So far, he said:\n\nThousands of shops have already applied [to accept bitcoin payments].\n\nJapanese Increasingly Using Bitcoin\nSushi-Bar Numazuko Ginza 1st\nLast week, Japanese national newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, which claims to have the largest circulation in the world, wrote that Bitcoin is “increasingly being used in Japan.”\nFor example, the publication reported that a popular conveyor belt sushi restaurant in Tokyo called Sushi-Bar Numazuko Ginza 1st is seeing a spike in bitcoin usage. While bitcoin was used only a few times a month two years ago at the restaurant, about 70 payments were made with bitcoin in March.\nThe restaurant also has a Bitcoin ATM inside. The fee for buying bitcoin there is 11.9 percent with the daily limit of ¥100000, according to Bitcoin ATM tracking website, Coinatmradar.\nThe restaurant manager told Yomiuri Shimbun:\n\nJapanese customers are using bitcoin more than we expected.\n\nKano echoed the sentiment, telling Bitcoin.com that: “At the moment, we’ve heard that mainly Japanese users use Bitcoin payment. There are not many foreigners or tourists using Bitcoin payment.” Males between 20s and 40s show the strongest growth in Bitcoin usage, the CEO revealed. Bitflyer is also seeing a significant growth in its user base. “The number of customers has been growing rapidly since April 1,” he said, adding that currently “the number of our users is almost 600k.”\nNo FX Fees\nThere is also the added advantage of not having to pay foreign exchange (FX) fees when using bitcoin compared to when exchanging foreign currencies into yen. According to Yomiuri Shimbun:\n\nWhen foreign tourists exchange dollars and other currencies to yen, they are charged a commission of about 3 percent. However, if they use bitcoins, they do not need to exchange money or pay exchange commissions.\n\nIn addition, the government has announced that, starting in July, purchasing bitcoins in Japan will no longer be levied consumption tax of 8 percent.\nHow much more do you think bitcoin usage will grow in Japan?

    "text": "\n Everyone involved in the cryptocurrency space is watching the price of bitcoin very closely these past few weeks. One person watching the value of bitcoin rise is the former CEO of the now-defunct Mt Gox bitcoin exchange. Mark Karpeles says he’s “monitoring the situation” as the Mt Gox bankruptcy may seemingly become solvent thanks to rising price of bitcoin.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Network Hashrate Surpasses Four Exahash Per Second\nCan the Mt Gox Bankruptcy Become Solvent? \nLast week a post on the subreddit r/mtgoxinsolvency detailed that “Mt Gox reached around 78.5 percent of the claims value today.” The person also asked the former CEO what would happen if bitcoin’s price makes it to 100 percent of the claims value. Karpeles appeared on the Reddit thread detailing his interest concerning the current situation. The former Mt Gox executive says because Coinlab is suing the company it really makes the claims value around 59 percent. Coinlab, the venture-backed blockchain company, has sued Mt Gox for $75 million before the company went bankrupt.  \nKarpeles is Monitoring the Situation \n“I am monitoring the situation,” explains Mark Karpeles. “We are still around 59.92% (74.29% if excluding CoinLab – but it can’t be excluded as the lawsuit is still in progress). Remember to use JPY values for calculation, since USD is bound to not be exact.”\nFollowing this statement, bitcoin developer Lukejr asks Karpeles if there is a “real possibility Mt Gox can exit bankruptcy if it reaches 100%?”  \n“Yep, but not to reopen as Mt Gox,” Karpeles replies. “The idea would be to establish some kind of trust to distribute BTC outside of the bankruptcy process, allowing for their easy distribution. The plan is to have recovered bitcoins distributed as is to BTC creditors, on the address they provided to receive the original payments.”\n\nAs things are right now, creditors cannot receive more than the approved claim amount (in JPY), which means that future recovered bitcoins would potentially be distributed to shareholders instead.\n\n‘The Inability to Compete With Today’s Exchanges’\nMany people discussing the subject on the forum were quite pleased with hearing Karpeles responses to questions. People further asked what the possibility was of Mt Gox re-opening and offering creditors a chance to become company shareholders as well as possibly cover the cost of some of the missing bitcoins.\n“That is an alternative, but it would involve re-launching Mt Gox, which would probably not work for many reasons,” Karpeles explains. “Having a trust set up and distribution list kept for distribution of recovered assets is perfectly legal, has no running cost and be fair. Compliance cost in the US is way outside of Coinlab’s reach, and I’d be surprised to hear Coinlab was ever planning to be compliant.\n\nAnyway, the largest reason why Mt Gox cannot be relaunched is the brand image, followed by the inability to compete with today’s exchanges.\n\n100 Percent Value Must be Met Before Starting the Process  \nThe discussion seemed very positive for those who lost funds during the bitcoin exchange’s hack in 2013 which was followed by bankruptcy. Karpeles then goes on to explain that most of the process cannot begin until the 100 percent threshold is met. In regards to the Coinlab lawsuit Karpeles says someone can order documentation from the court to help with the process, but he can’t afford to do that at the moment.\nIn theory, anyone could do it, so if someone does I’ll be happy to host the files on dropbox or anything,” Karpeles adds.\nWhat do you think about Mark’s statements about the bankruptcy becoming solvent?

Ltd, is launching a bitcoin trading platform on May 24.\nFormerly known as GMO Wallet Co. Ltd, GMO-Z.com Coin Co. Ltd was established in October 2016 to develop a digital currency exchange and trading business. The company started testing digital currency trading services in November 2016 and has been preparing for a full-scale operation ever since, according to Tuesday’s announcement.\nStarting on May 9, interested users can pre-register for an account on this new trading platform.\nTwo Products Planned at Launch\nThe platform will be called “Z.com Coin”, according to the company’s announcement. Initially, it will facilitate the trading of two types of products:\n\n“virtual currency FX”\n“virtual currency”\n\nThe first product type describes bitcoin margin trading, with leverage of up to 5 times. The second product type describes bitcoin trading in Japanese yen with the following fee structure:\n\n[Bitcoin] Trading fee “0 yen”. Bitcoin withdrawal fee “0 yen”\n\nAt launch, only bitcoin will be supported but the company plans to support other cryptocurrencies in the future, starting with Ethereum. Z.com Coin will also offer more functionalities such as charts and tools.\nOverall, the company plans to develop new digital currency services in cooperation with all companies within the GMO Internet Group. These services will be offered throughout the Asian region under the group’s global brand “Z.com”, the company details.\nComplying with Regulatory Requirements\nCiting provisions for consumer protection established by the revised fund settlement law which took effect on April 1, GMO Internet Group outlines various measures the company has taken to comply with rules set forth by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA).\n“As a countermeasure against theft of virtual currencies, we have developed a management system and security system for customers’ assets, such as adopting cold storage and multi-signature,” the company wrote.\nMoney received from customers is calculated and verified each business day, separate from the company’s own funds. In addition, customers’ private keys are stored separately, the company conveyed. “All assets deposited from customers are managed separately from the assets of GMO – Z.com Coin.”\nDo you think GMO’s bitcoin trading platform will do well?

The photo got circulated on Monday after Marcron defeated the right nationalist Marine Le Pen. The photo generated about 1500 up votes.  \nAlso read: Bitcoin Network Hashrate Surpasses Four Exahash Per Second\nEven though the photo inspired many crypto-enthusiasts to become excited that France’s new president might be a tech geek, there is not much information about his stance on bitcoin or his level of expertise.\nEmmanual Macron\nQuestions Regarding Macron’s Bitcoin Expertise\nAccording to various news sources, the photo was originally taken last March at the Cap Digital tech event…but this is nothing out of the ordinary. As part of his previous job as Minister of Finance, he constantly had to provide the pretense of appreciating technology, even if he knows little to nothing about it.\nThere is one roughly translated quote from a french article that suggests he might possess some inkling of understanding. Macron said,\n“financial regulation to allow experimentation of blockchains dedicated to the market of Bonds…If the experimentation is conclusive, the government could extend it to unlisted securities in order to promote the emergence of a SME exchange.”\nMacron’s Politics and Blockchain Ingenuity\nRegardless if the quote says anything about his knowledge of cryptocurrencies, trusting politicians to do the right thing with technology is always a contentious topic. politicians mainly focus on regulating industries and writing laws.\nThis is especially true since Macron generally supports left-leaning ideologies, which are notoriously hostile to any type of money. Macron even supports the EU and policies that work to create communal environments, which do not usually resonate with the spirit of bitcoin or any money. One Steemit article said,\n“Macron for instance is a big booster of the EU and avows liberal stances. He may well follow EU perspectives which will do nothing to help France as it submerges into the red ooze of a union that is determined to swallow countries whole in order to ensure they lose their identity.”\nTherefore, the idea that Macron may appreciate cryptocurrency and cryptography is likely not within the realm of possibility. On the other side of the coin, times are changing and even politicians are starting to be humbled by the sheer power of blockchain technology.\nDo you think Macron is a true supporter of blockchain technology? Do you think politicians will eventually support bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below.

He has been scrutinized over the past few months due to security leaks and his relationship with members of the Russian government. Just a few days before Trump pushed Comey out of his position the FBI Director spoke to a Senate Judiciary Committee concerning threats against the nation and the agencies’ issues with technology.\n“Unfortunately, there is a real and growing gap between law enforcement’s legal authority to access digital information and its technical ability to do so,” explains Comey. “The FBI refers to this growing challenge as ‘going dark,’ and it affects the spectrum of our work.”\nThe Tradeoff Between Privacy and Security\nComey goes on to detail that during the first half of the fiscal year the federal agency was unable to access data on 3000 mobile devices using the government’s technological resources. “This figure represents nearly half of all the mobile devices the FBI attempted to access in that timeframe,” the former Director notes.\nDuring his speech Comey also states some people believe the challenge the FBI deals with is a “tradeoff between privacy and security.” However, members of the FBI believe accessing data using legal authority, such as a warrant, justifies the agencies need to access private information on mobile phones and computers. The recent statements also resemble comments from Comey during an August security symposium organized by Symantec. The FBI Director said at the time that absolute privacy in the U.S. is a farce.  \n“The general principle is one that we’ve always accepted in the United States and has been at the core of our country,” Comey stated during the event.\n\nThere is no such thing as absolute privacy in America. There is no place outside of judicial authority.        \n\nVirtual Currencies Are Being Used to Obscure Transactions\nAt the Senate Judiciary Committee Comey says nearly every crime these days has an “element that is digitally-based or facilitated.” The former director says groups like ISIS are using technology like social media, and encrypted messaging platforms to recruit more members. Furthermore, Comey says currencies like bitcoin are being used to anonymize illegal transactions.\n“Some of our criminal investigators face the challenge of identifying online pedophiles who hide their crimes and identities behind layers of anonymizing technologies, or drug traffickers who use virtual currencies to obscure their transactions,” Comey reveals.\nFBI special agents and analysts should have the very best technological tools and data centers available to combat the ‘going dark’ period the agency faces, says Comey. Although as Comey leaves his Director position, the U.S. federal government has also given the FBI a mandate to decrease the number of data centers the agency uses across the country.\nWhat do you think about Comey’s statements before being fired by Trump?

    "text": "\n Norway’s largest internet-based bank has added a new feature tethering bitcoin accounts to the company’s web bank platform. Skandiabanken customers are now able to access Coinbase accounts giving members insight into their digital investments alongside their savings and checking accounts.\nAlso read: Crypto Tales Pt. 1: Odd Stories That Surface in Bitcoin-Land\nSkandiabanken Recognizes Cryptocurrency as an Investment Class\nSkandiabanken executives are starting to see bitcoin as an asset class for the 21st century. “We recognize cryptocurrency as an investment class similar to other securities,” Christoffer Hernæs, Skandiabanken’s Head of Innovation and Development explains to local news outlets.\nSkandiabanken conducts all of its services online and is currently the most popular internet bank in Norway. The bank believes customers will appreciate the new feature as it provides members with an overview of their digital investments. The service will initially only be offered to Skandiabanken customers using the bank’s payment platform.\nHernæs details that cryptocurrency is still a very nascent technology and economy. “It’s still an early phase for cryptocurrencies,” Hernæs states. “It may be ok to test the waters, without jumping into it head first.” The new feature constitutes as the “first step in a direction we believe in,” explains the Skandiabanken executive.\nSkandiabanken’s new feature within the web bank interface.\nWinners Will Be Those Who Collaborate With New Players and Technology \nCurrently, Norwegian tax officials classify bitcoin as a property and is a taxable income according to the country’s Tax Act. Hernæs says Skandiabanken customers will be notified of these requirements if they decide to utilize the bank’s bitcoin services.\nMembers of the Skandiabanken Norway branch can also use the service to purchase bitcoins via Paypal’s payment processor. Although some banking authorities believe bitcoin may be a scary technology, Hernæs explains Skandiabanken believes it’s a good idea to be in lockstep with new technologies.\n“We acknowledge that this is something people want to put their money into,” says Hernæs. “Then we think it is the right time to look at new solutions we can offer. We think it’s a better approach than categorically thinking that this is scary.”\n\nThe bank winners will be those who collaborate with new players and new technology, not those who deny it.\n\nThe Skandiabanken feature is similar to the American financial services company USAA’s Coinbase integration. Back in November of 2015, USAA started a program allowing customers access to their Coinbase accounts using the firm’s online and mobile applications. Just like USAA’s program, Skandiabanken customers simply log into Coinbase through the bank’s login portal.\nNorway Bitcoin Association Founder is Pleased With the Scandinavian Bank’s Decision\nBitcoin.com also spoke with the founder of the Norway Bitcoin and Blockchain Association, Stephan Nilsson who says he’s pleased with the Scandinavian bank’s forward-thinking decision.\n“We were very pleased to learn about Skandiabanken’s new cryptocurrency feature and that they are recognizing cryptocurrencies as an investment class,” explains Nilsson. “This shows that the Scandinavian bank, that has been in the front line for many years as an internet-only bank, now continues to be a leader in the fintech area, embracing new technologies like cryptocurrencies.”\n\nThis is a very important signal to the rest of the financial industry as well as to the society\n\n“It represents a milestone in bitcoin usability when the everyday bank customer can handle cryptocurrencies in their web-bank just as easy as their savings and investment accounts,” Nilsson added. \nWhat do you think about the Norwegian Internet-based bank offering visualization to bitcoin accounts?

At current market prices, one mBTC is worth $1.85, and people have been bolstering the mBTC idea well before one mBTC was a dollar. \nThe reason people would like to use the mBTC unit measurements instead is because it’s easier for humans to innumerate and communicate smaller portions of bitcoin. Furthermore, some people just learning about bitcoin sometimes believe they have to purchase a whole coin, which is not the case as anyone can purchase bitcoins in fractions. So bitcoin proponents believe using units of mBTC to describe smaller portions would allow new users to better conceptualize that they can buy ten dollars worth or 5 mBTC. There are a few wallet services and business that use the mBTC unit denomination within their application’s interface. Wallets that use mBTC include Electrum, Blockchain, and Mycelium. \nSatoshis & Bits\nAnother terminology that measures smaller portions of bitcoin in units is called a “Satoshi”, named after Bitcoin’s creator. A Satoshi is the smallest fraction of bitcoin that can be recorded on the blockchain and equals one hundred-millionths of a whole bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC). The name caught on around 2010 after a lot of discussion concerning the topic came up in forums. Sometimes traders refer to one Satoshi as a “Sat” which is just an abbreviation. A “bit” is another terminology used to describe a millionth of a bitcoin.\nUsing Satoshis and bits as a language to discuss smaller bitcoin denominations is more widely used than mBTC. A few symbols have been created to represent a Satoshi measurement, but nothing has gained widespread adoption.\nWould it be Easier to Explain to New Users?\nThroughout the past few weeks, the topic of changing the denomination language has come up in forums a lot more than usual. On May 11, one bitcoin proponent describes why people should think about mBTC units, saying that it would be far easier to communicate to new users.  \n“Many new people that ask to me about bitcoins are “scared” by the fact that to buy a bitcoin you need several thousand of euros,” explains the post.\n\nTo buy 0.05 of “something” sounds weird and little. So I think the community would greatly benefit if it switches to mBTC in exchanges and wallets. Also for shopping it would be easier to think that you are paying for a beer that costs three mBTC and not 0.003 BTC.\n\nOthers believe things are just fine the way it is and it would be too difficult for the community and industry to adopt this language. Furthermore, some believe wallets companies, exchanges, and bitcoin-based businesses should decide to use whatever they prefer. Moreover, due to the rise of miner fees, some say the proposal of mBTC units is futile as many smaller denominations of bitcoin held in wallets can’t be used and are essentially unspendable addresses.\nFor now changing the language of bitcoin units probably won’t happen very quickly but there are those that believe the cryptocurrency environment is still young and starting this trend now would be helpful for communication.\nWhat do you think about promoting the use of mBTC for smaller bitcoin denominations?

    "text": "\n Over the past few weeks, traders have been complaining about slow trade executions while using the U.S. based cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex. The trading platform says it has recently been suffering from many severe distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks alongside a surge of mainstream growth.\nAlso read: Crypto Tales Pt. 1: Odd Stories That Surface in Bitcoin-Land\nPoloniex Suffers From Multiple DDoS Attacks Over the Past Few Weeks\nLately across social media platforms and cryptocurrency focused forums, there have been users complaining about trading on the exchange Poloniex. Back in April, as the digital currency Ripple XRP began to show its first signs of a bull run the exchange experienced a lot of customers complaining about downtime and trade executions. One individual states that he believes Poloniex is just overwhelmed by all the cryptocurrency price spikes lately saying;\n\nI think they are just overwhelmed. Lots of new users, new trade volume, lots of additional stress on their systems and on coins that haven’t seen this type of activity before.\n\nSince then Poloniex said the platform has had issues with a lot of DDoS attacks and a massive influx of new traders using the exchange. On April 2 the exchange told its users they had full knowledge of connection issues. \n“We are aware and are working as quickly as we can to resolve the connectivity issues,” explained the trading platform. Looking at Twitter, Poloniex details that it had connectivity problems on May 7, 8, 12, 13, and also had a stop-limit issue on May 16.\n“We’ve been under continuous DDoS attack which inevitably affects other areas of operations,” Poloniex details on Twitter May 13. “We’re mitigating as fast as we can.”\n\nPoloniex Addresses Concerns in a New Blog Post\nOn May 16 Poloniex detailed its current position via a blog post citing an unprecedented level of new market entrants and DDoS intrusions.\n“Malicious threats to an online global exchange, like Poloniex, can occur at any time of the day, on any day of the year, and from anywhere on the planet,” explains the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nIn the case of Poloniex, these threats are present every day, often with multiple, unrelenting DDoS attacks directed at several endpoints simultaneously.      \n\nPoloniex Captures a 600% Increase of Active Traders and 640% More Transactions\nPoloniex also says that the trading platform has seen a significant increase in trading its many markets. “Since January, we’ve seen an increase of more than 600 percent active traders online and regularly process 640 percent more transactions than we did merely four months ago,” Poloniex details.\n“In a short period of time, exchanges can see sudden and tremendous swells of new users seeking to create accounts, yet to meet compliance obligations, only so much of this onboarding process can be automated,” the exchange adds.\n\nAdditionally, seasoned traders intensify buy and sell activity, and margin positions are rapidly being opened and closed. As trading activity multiplies with an expanding user base, exchange staff and support grow only as fast as human resources can hire.\n\nA Commitment to Scaling Up \nStatistics show the exchange has seen a significant amount of volumes over the past four months. According to Coinmarketcap, the trading platform is exchanging roughly 291,917 BTC ($506M) worth of cryptocurrency trades per day. At present, the exchange’s most traded digital asset is Ripple XRP with a $204 million USD 24-hour trade volume. Half a billion dollars worth of daily trades is no small potatoes, and Poloniex says it will continue to be “committed to scaling up.”\nWhat do you think about Poloniex saying there is a significant influx of new cryptocurrency traders this year?

    "text": "\n Following the ransomware epidemic this past weekend, Kathleen Rice, a Representative from New York’s 4th congressional district submitted a bill asking the Secretary of Homeland Security to “analyze and disseminate a threat assessment regarding terrorist use of virtual currency.”\nAlso Read: Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Considers Bitcoin   \nHouse Representative Proposes that Government Agencies Assess and Disseminate Terrorist Use of Virtual Currencies \nKathleen Rice, New York’s 4th congressional district representative.\nThe proposed bill submitted by the U.S. House of Representatives Democrat is called the “Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists Use of Virtual Currencies Act.” The newly introduced bill says the term “virtual currency” covers a “digital medium of exchange, unit of account or a store of value.” The threat assessment should begin 120 days after the date of the enactment of the proposed Act, the bill explains.\n“Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis, shall, in coordination with appropriate Federal partners, develop and disseminate a threat assessment regarding the actual and potential threat posed by individuals using virtual currency to carry out activities in furtherance of an act of terrorism, including the provision of material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization.”\nSenator Lindsey Graham Believes Ransomware Is an Act of Terrorism \nSouth Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.\nOther U.S. congressional representatives believe something should be done to combat ransomware. Roughly one year ago during a congressional hearing on May 18, the South Carolina Republican Senator, Lindsey Graham, said ransomware was an act of terrorism. Graham explained during his speech that with ransomware “it is only a matter of time until somebody gets physically hurt.”        \n“We have a state-sponsor of terrorism list that the State Department collects. If you are on that list, bad things come your way because you are a bad actor,” the South Carolina Senator explained.\n\nIf we don’t wake up some of the nation-states where these problems reside in large measure, you are never going to fix this problem.\n\nResearchers Detail Digital Currencies Are Not a Method Used by Terrorists\nThe statements from bureaucratic officials who believe virtual currencies are being used by terrorists follow a slew of published scholarly reports concluding that terrorism financed with bitcoin is a bit exaggerated.\nIn 2015, the UK government released a report that detailed bitcoin is not used for terrorism or is a criminal risk. “Digital currencies are currently not a method by which terrorists seem to raise or move money out of the UK,” the 100-page HM Treasury report details.  \nMoreover, this past March a consultant at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) David Carlisle said “treating cryptocurrencies as an exceptional threat creates the misleading impression that more conventional financial products are not already equally, or more, vulnerable to terrorist exploitation.”\n\nOn May 16 after the new proposal was introduced by representative Rice, the bitcoin and blockchain legislative advocacy group, Coin Center fired back, publishing an article dismissing the relationship between terrorist financing and digital currencies. Coin Center’s Jerry Brito cites a recently published assessment from the Center for a New American Security report which states;\n\nThere is no more than anecdotal evidence that terrorist groups have used virtual currencies to support themselves. \n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence will assess the new proposal submitted by representative Rice in the next few days.\nWhat do you think about the government researching terrorist-related virtual currency usage?

According to the letter under Senate and House rules, congressional members have the authority to examine IRS actions in regards to emerging tax administration. This includes the emergence of digital currencies the letter explains, and the three officials are requesting information concerning the IRS summons to Coinbase.    \n“Please describe the IRS’s current digital currency strategy and provide any existing policies and procedures,” explains the congressional letter to the IRS commissioner. Furthermore, the letter asks the following questions;\n\nHow does the John Doe summons issued to Coinbase fit into the larger IRS digital currency strategy? — What is the justification for the IRS’s position that all Coinbase customer records are needed for this timeframe?\n\n‘We Strongly Question Whether the IRS has Actually Established a Reasonable Basis’\nThe IRS’s summons to Coinbase is being fought by the company for being too broad, and customers have also filed legal action against the tax agency’s requests. “Coinbase remains concerned with the indiscriminate and overbroad scope of the government’s summons, and we have produced no records under the summons,” wrote Coinbase lawyer, Juan Suarez back in March. \nAccording to an affidavit written by IRS tax agent Utzke the agency’s reasoning is due to less than a thousand Coinbase customers filing taxes. However, the three congressional members say they are questioning the IRS’s actions against the records of a half of a million Coinbase customers stating in the letter;  \n\nWe strongly question whether the IRS has actually established a reasonable basis to support the mass production of records for half of a million people, the vast majority of whom appear to not be conducting the volume of transactions needed to report them to the IRS. Based on the information before us, this summons seems overly broad, extremely burdensome, and highly intrusive to a large population of individuals.\n\nThe recent letter from Senator Orrin Hatch, and representatives Brady, and Buchanan says they would appreciate it if the IRS would provide the congressional members with a briefing concerning the summons. The letter also states it would like to receive this information no later than June 7, 2017.\n“The IRS’s actions, in this case, can also set a dangerous precedent for companies facilitating virtual currency transactions that could be subject to a similar summons,” the letter adds.\nWhat do you think about the letter sent to the IRS from the three U.S. congressional members?

The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has announced that it will begin to trial a number of regulations pertaining to virtual currencies.\nSouth Africa has been among the slowest of the advanced economies to begin to develop a juridical apparatus for cryptocurrencies, garnering criticism for failing to embrace virtual currencies and blockchain technology sooner.\nLoerien Gamaroff, CEO of blockchain services company Bankymoon, has revealed that his company will be the subject of a trial of SARB’s preliminary regulations. Gamaroff confirmed that he has had consistent contact with The South African Reserve Bank in discussing the regulatory sandbox, and has conducted several seminars pertaining to potential use cases for cryptocurrency within the South African economy. Gamaroff also revealed his involvement with government-directed research into alternative cryptocurrencies.\nThe announcements come amidst growing acceptance of cryptocurrency technology within South Africa\n“All we are doing at this point is seeing how far this relationship will go on within this sandbox,” Gamaroff stated. “This is because the Reserve Bank is very hesitant to give a stamp of approval on anything that comes out. The sandbox will only be Bitcoin-focused during this initial phase, but is focused on applying broad regulations to all cryptocurrencies,” he said.\n\nGamaroff has expressed his belief that regulations are ultimately positive for cryptocurrency, and will be vital in attaining legitimacy for virtual currency use in South Africa. “I think the regulation will move things along and make people on the street comfortable with Bitcoin. With these new regulations, these everyday people can now trust that Bitcoin is not just for hackers and criminals,” Gamaroff said.\nIn February, SARB announced intentions to develop a national virtual currency that would based on distributed ledger technology. SARB also described plans to carry out research regarding the feasibility of cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption within South Africa.\nThe announcements come amidst growing acceptance of cryptocurrency technology within South Africa. Michael Jordaan, the former CEO of First National Bank, recently stated his support for cryptocurrencies, and belief that they will one day come to rival fiat currencies. P2P trading volume has also enjoyed consistent growth in recent months.\nDo you think that Bankymoon will enjoy an unfair ‘headstart’ over its competitors within the South African cryptocurrency industry through being the sole company involved in the trial of SARB’s regulations?

    "text": "\n Bitcoin has finally surpassed the US$3000 per BTC average across global exchanges. In fact, it didn’t stop there and touched an all-time high of $3230 during the start of August 5. The decentralized cryptocurrency now commands a hefty $51.9 billion market cap while trading platforms are currently seeing intense exchange volumes at $1.6 billion USD/BTC trades over the past 24-hours.\nAlso read: Considering Bitcoin An Asset Could Set Back Adoption in Israel\nBitcoin is Trending Worldwide \nOn August 5 bitcoin surpassed the $3000 USD per BTC threshold on the trading platform Bitstamp. Smashing the $3000 vantage point was not enough for bitcoin as BTC prices touched an all-time high of $3230. At press time one BTC is roughly $3150 as traders take some profits from the overnight high. Some speculate that the price spike may be due to BIP141 voting period ending and the possibility of activating the protocol Segregated Witness (Segwit). Currently, a vast quantity of the network’s hashrate is directing its efforts towards this plan as the first half of the “New York Agreement” otherwise known as Segwit2x. At the moment, there are 621 blocks left until Segwit goes live on the Bitcoin network. The second half of the agreement entails activating a 2MB hard fork on the network roughly ~3 months after the activation.\nSegregated Witness will be locked in on the network by the end of the month. \nIt’s also worth noting that the price has rallied during the latest announcement from global law enforcement detailing the takedown of the two biggest darknet markets Hansa, and Alphabay. Alongside this, the BTC-e exchange was also seized and the price didn’t nudge at all. It seems bitcoin markets have been resilient enough to bounce back after the Bitfinex hack last year, the recent ETF decision, and now the latest two darknet market takedowns also did nothing to the price.\n\nIn addition to this, the price spiked in the midst of a hard fork. The developers of the client Bitcoin ABC and others have veered off to form its own network. This, in turn, produced a new token called ‘Bitcoin Cash’ (BCH) which has an 8MB block size limit, and also removes Segregated Witness. Even though the blockchain split occurred on August 1 and the two bitcoin communities went separate ways, the price of BTC has remained extremely bullish. As bitcoin touched a high of $3230 across global exchanges BCH tokens have hit a low of $200-250 depending on the exchange.\nThe digital asset bitcoin has come a long way since the first issuance of bitcoins were released into the wild on January 3rd, 2009. Now there are 16.4 million BTC in circulation, and the cryptocurrency is more popular than ever. As far as the Google Trends site is concerned interest in bitcoin has grown exponentially higher than its jump in growth during 2013. Google Trends also shows a significant amount of interest is stemming from the eastern side of the world, most notably in Asia, and many countries located within the continent of Africa.\nBitcoin crosses $3000 USD per BTC on Bitstamp and many popular exchanges. At press time one BTC is worth between $3130-3165 USD.\nRecord Trade Volumes \nFurthermore, Localbitcoins volumes across the globe are also at all-time highs right now as people are trading over $20-30 million worth of bitcoins every two weeks. Alongside Localbitcoins and traditional exchange volumes reaching new highs, both Paxful and the decentralized trading platform Bitsquare are also seeing record trade volumes. Moreover, countries such as China, Japan, India, and Korea are dominating bitcoin trade volumes as cryptocurrencies have been high demand in those regions.           \nBitcoin Printed in Newspapers Worldwide\n\nAs bitcoin’s value broke higher levels and crossed the $3K price zone, mainstream media has been reporting on the digital currency’s success nearly every day. On top of that, bitcoin stories are being printed in newspapers all around the world, in publications like Süddeutsche Zeitung, the Wall Street Journal, Dagens Næringsliv, the Moscow Times and more. The mainstream exposure has led to more people around the world hearing about bitcoin as well as attracting investment.\nCelebrities, Socialites, and Big Name Investors Talk Bitcoin \nIn unison with the mainstream media headlines coming out every day, many famous celebrities, socialites and big name investors are also talking about bitcoin. Just recently the Shark Tank star Mark Cuban discussed the decentralized currency with his Twitter followers. Alongside this, more well-known individuals such as Chamath Palihapitiya, Dan Bilzerian, John Bollinger, Jeremy Liew and many others have been observed discussing bitcoin’s potential.\n\nThe Bitcoin Economy Grows Bigger Every Day \nRight now it’s estimated that more than ten million people worldwide hold a material amount of bitcoin according to the University of Cambridge. 2.9 to 5.8 million users are actively using their bitcoin wallets, and the total number of wallets used in 2017 has increased 4X since 2013. Furthermore, the Bitcoin network hashrate is processing at over five exahash per second as mining power has increased exponentially. Nearly every statistic in bitcoin’s life has spiked massively over the past year.\nBitcoin’s hashrate is currently a whopping 6,308,895,126 GH/s.\nIt’s a great milestone for bitcoin to cross the $3000 USD per BTC territory but there are many other landmark occasions taking place often across the network. 2017 has been one of the most interesting years so far and the next six months will surely be filled with more excitement. $3000 is just one of many price records to break as many bitcoin proponents believe the rise in value is just getting started.\nWhat do you think about bitcoin crossing the $3000 per BTC range?

Customers of BTCC, Huobi, and Okcoin can now withdraw their coins up to certain daily limits.\nAlso read: India’s Government Divided Over Bitcoin Legalization\nBitcoin Withdrawals Resumed\nFollowing the inspections by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), BTCC, Huobi, and Okcoin halted coin withdrawals in February. Almost four months later, on Wednesday May 31, at least two of them reportedly lifted their cryptocurrency withdrawal suspensions.\nAccording to Twitter user Cnledger, BTCC’s customer service confirmed that they have resumed coin withdrawals on Wednesday. A Reddit user who claimed to have initiated a withdrawal request at the exchange said that the daily limit was 20 BTC for his account type and that his request was approved within 20 minutes.\nOkcoin has also lifted its withdrawal suspension subject to certain limits, 8btc reported on Thursday. “The 24-hour withdrawal limit of the International site and OKEX is: 200 BTC, 500 LTC and 1,000 ETH,” the publication quoted the exchange’s website. “As for the Chinese site, the limit is 20 BTC (10 of which could be withdrawn to external addresses), 400 LTC (200 of which could be withdrawn to external addresses) and 1,000 ETH.” However, the exchange’s customer service told the publication:\n\n\nThe withdrawal feature is being tested at the moment.\n\n\nThe last of the “Big Three” Chinese bitcoin exchanges to resume withdrawals is Huobi. According to Cnledger on Thursday morning, Huobi has also resumed withdrawals and “users can withdraw up to 50 BTC per day.”\nBitcoin Prices and Trading Volumes Responded\nThe results of the withdrawals resuming were quickly realized at global exchanges on Wednesday. While the price of a bitcoin rose sharply worldwide, they were more bullish on BTCC and Okcoin, typically trading 10 percent higher than other exchanges.\nFor instance, while Bitflyer, Bitstamp, and Bitfinex had 5%, 7%, and 9% positive gains respectively on Wednesday evening, Okcoin and BTCC had a 19% and a 15% 24-hour growth. The price of litecoin on Chinese exchanges also experienced the same effect.\nGlobal trading volumes also picked up substantially after the news spread, with BTCC and Okcoin showing higher volumes than elsewhere for the rest of the day.\n\nNews of the withdrawals resuming came shortly after the three exchanges announced that they were adding either ETH or ETC trading to their platforms. Huobi began ETH trading on May 30 while Okcoin is starting on June 1. BTCC CEO Bobby Lee also announced a couple of days prior that his exchange will list ETC after conducting a series of Twitter polls.\nThe Long Wait is Over but PBOC Denies Being Responsible\nThe PBOC’s inspections of Chinese bitcoin exchanges started in January. Then in February, all three major exchanges announced that they were halting bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals, but CNY withdrawals were not affected.\nA post on Huobi’s blog cites the need for a system upgrade to comply with new anti-money laundering requirements as well as foreign exchange and other financial regulations.\nAlthough the exchanges never stated whether they were ordered by the authorities to suspend withdrawals, a leaked document reported by 8btc in April suggests that the suspension was a direct order from one of the authorities.\nHowever, 8btc reported new findings last week that “the suspension of BTC withdrawal was not a direct order from the authority,” according to a recent letter from the PBOC. This letter was supposedly in reply to an inquiry about whether the central bank was responsible for bitcoin exchanges halting withdrawals. Cnledger also tweeted about this letter last week:\n\nPBOC reply to BTC user: we did not ask trading platforms to suspend withdrawals. It was a decision made by themselves. The inspection has not ended.\n\nEarlier this month, Bitcoin.com reported on the Chinese regulators preparing to issue regulatory guidelines for bitcoin trading platforms in China. The document is expected to be released sometime in June.\nDo you think Chinese bitcoin exchanges can return to their former popularity once the withdrawal limitations have all been removed?

    "text": "\n According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, the bitcoin company Coinbase is seeking investors in a new funding round that aims for a $1 billion dollar valuation.\nAlso read: Bitcoin Could Progress the Fourth Industrial Revolution Says Wealth Manager\nCoinbase Seeks Investment Pledges of ‘$100 Million or More’ for a $1 Billion Valuation Goal\nSources familiar with the matter told the publication Coinbase is currently having discussions with potential investors. Currently, investors that may pledge towards the round are undisclosed, but the source has disclosed it will be one of the biggest funding rounds in the digital currency space. The company has been one of the most well-known startups since Brian Armstrong, and Fred Ehrsam founded the company in 2012.\nOver the course of the company’s life, it has so far raised $117 million over five funding rounds. This includes funding from big-name venture firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, BBVA Ventures, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The Wall Street Journal says the company is now seeking “$100 million or more” from investors looking to pledge.\n“There’s more interest in bitcoin when prices go up, and then trading volume goes up,” explains one investor to the news outlet.\n\nTherefore there’s more interest in bitcoin companies.   \n\nInvestors Are Noticing the San Francisco Bitcoin Company’s Popularity Continues to Grow\nBesides getting large capital injections from venture firms and individual investors the company has grown massively. For instance, Coinbase claims to have 7.4 million users and works with 46,000 merchants who accept bitcoin. Additionally, the company has issued 24.2 million wallets and its software team has released 10,000 developer applications. On May 26 the company’s CEO Brian Armstrong told the public the company was seeing a significant influx of new registrants.\n“Coinbase had 40,000 new users sign up in one day, or approximately one San Francisco Giant’s Stadium,” exclaimed Armstrong.\nMay was a crazy month for Coinbase as the price spike caused “Slow load times and degraded performance” and “partial outage” issues on May 22 through 25th.\nIf venture organizations and investors give more funding to Coinbase, the startup will be the largest funded bitcoin-based company on the record. The valuation will push Coinbase higher than other bitcoin-focused companies with significant funding capital such as 21 Inc. and Circle Financial.\nWhat do you think about Coinbase looking for more venture capital?

    "text": "\n Bankers, governments, and other trusted centralized organizations require society to be steeped in runaway inflation. These fiduciary cartels thrive when they manipulate the money supply and cause drastic shifts in prices within the market economy they lord over. They believe the money supply must be regulated and controlled for the economy to function optimally, lest society collapses as a result of too little currency injection. \nAlso read: Bitcoin Could Progress the Fourth Industrial Revolution Says Wealth Manager\nLuckily, bitcoin solves the dilemma of needing a trusted third party to control the money supply. Before delving further into why this is the case, everyone must possess a proper and clear grasp of inflation and deflation as economic concepts.\nInflation and Deflation Explained\nInflation refers to the rise of the cost of goods and services in a market environment and the decrease of the purchasing power of the prescribed currency.\nInvestopedia defined inflation,\nInflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising and, consequently, the purchasing power of currency is falling. Central banks attempt to limit inflation in order to keep the economy running smoothly.\nConversely, deflation is the decline in the cost of goods and service resulting from contraction of a money supply within an economic environment. Deflation generally causes an increase of the purchasing power of a currency within circulation. According to some economists, excess deflation can cause market actors to horde money. However, inflation tends to be the more troubling and nefarious problem.\nFor example, if a currency is heavily inflated, and you travel to the local supermarket to buy groceries, you may notice an upswing in the price of bread. This price “inflation” could be the result of the grocer arbitrarily altering the price, but more likely it occurred as a result of an inflated currency. In other words, too much printing and distribution of the currency would have devalued its purchasing power and caused bread to appear more expensive. In reality, the bread likely has had the same value as always, but the decreased value of the circulated currency provided the illusion that the bread was more expensive.\nWith a basic understanding of deflation and inflation clearly in mind, it would seem obvious that central money manipulators are needed to keep the economy grounded in a state of equilibrium, where money is created with integrity and circulated for the betterment of society. However, there are several reasons why having a small trusted group of elites control society’s wealth is impractical, unneeded, and dangerous…and has only instigated economic woes.\nThe Problem of Central Money Manipulation by Fiduciary Cartels\nIn some places, governments and central authorities have caused such extreme runaway inflation that a currency has lost all of its value and become worthless.\nRecent examples include Venezuela and Greece. Mass currency devaluation through inflation likely also occurred in the United States, which led to the Great Depression. The Austrian economists suggested that creation of the Federal Reserve bank and its manipulation of the currency supply directly caused the depression, among other, more recent economic catastrophes.\nA Mises article on Greece captured the effects of credit expansion and money manipulation, then the subsequent runaway inflation:\nWhen currencies collapse, price inflation usually picks up. More units of the currency must be offered to acquire goods and services. What had started with credit expansion and distortions in the real economy, then, may well end up with high price inflation rates and currency reform.\nAnother reason to avoid allowing a handful people control currency in a centralized manner is because it provides a subtle way for those individuals to “steal” value from everyone. Whenever central authorities inflate the currency supply, as mentioned, it causes the value or purchasing power of the currency to decline. This value is basically lost or “stolen” from the people.\nIn other words, one group caused another group to lose their property’s value. In most places, this activity by another name is called “destruction of property” or “theft.” However, currency devaluation is such an esoteric and ingenious form of theft or destruction that it goes unnoticed and unexamined by the majority of the population.\nA last major reason to reject central suppliers of money is more obvious and terrifying. When a small group of people have direct access to the wealth supply of whole economies, what prevents them from electronically keying that wealth into their own personal accounts? What stops them from making themselves richer and the rest of the world poorer? What stops them from taking that wealth and using it to start wars or harm people in the name of national defense or protection?\nThe short answer to these questions is nothing. Nothing stops them. These individuals can fill their coffers at a whim, and control the rise and fall of whole country’s by arbitrarily inflating and deflating a currency as they see fit…and the result of allowing this kind of trust to be placed in the hands of these elite few have been absolutely devastating. It has led to mass warfare, mass exploitation of the population, and in some cases to runaway inflation, mass starvation and death.\nThank goodness the solution to these problems is here. It is called bitcoin.\nBitcoin Solves the Problem of Runaway Inflation, while Abolishing the Need for Centralized Trust\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency that is automated by a consensus network algorithm. This algorithm, which was predetermined by creator Satoshi Nakamoto, has a set supply of bitcoins that will be distributed over the long term. This number is currently set to 21 million units of bitcoin.\nThis mathematically encoded number of bitcoin means that no central group or fiduciary cartel can control the currency. In other words, they cannot inflate or deflate a currency to the detriment of the population. In this sense, bitcoin is naturally deflationary or disinflationary. This denotes Bitcoin has utility in the sense that it neither inflates or deflates on a whim or caprice. No human actor can make changes to the protocol without achieving consensus.\nIn this regard, users of bitcoin have hedged themselves against control, against the small groups of trusted elites who can manage the flow or circulation of money across a population. When a currency like bitcoin is protected from artificial manipulation, it prevents people from using the creation and control of money to exploit and defraud others. It is the solution to the problem of runaway inflation and all forms of monetary control.\nSome people think that bitcoin is naturally inflationary as a result of its algorithm. It is true the protocol specifies the minting of new coins via mining, but this is not the same as arbitrary inflation that causes ungodly increases in price of goods and services. The protocol was built to create coins in such a way that both heightens the value of bitcoin and does not allow for the market to be flooded. It is enough to keep the market humming, yet not overburdened.\nBitcoin, then, is the most obvious solution to stopping the fiduciary cartels and other central entities from lording over everyone and causing massive undue harm to millions. It prevents runaway inflation. It stops theft through that inflation. It thwarts loss of monetary value caused by unscrupulous actors. It kills the evil of greed. It is the economic panacea par excellence. Time to open a bitcoin wallet and take the power back.\nDo you think bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are a hedge against runaway inflation and the banking cartels?

According to the announcement, the Titanium Project researchers will begin undertaking a three-year, €5 million project, that aims to curb this criminal activity and will be subsidized by the European Union.\n“Criminal and terrorist activities related to virtual currencies and darknet markets evolve quickly and vary in technical sophistication, resilience and intended targets,” details the Titanium Project coordinator Ross King, a senior scientist at the AIT Austrian Institute of Technology.\nTitanium Is Backed by European Law Enforcement and Interpol \nThe announcement says that blockchain technology used in virtual currencies like bitcoin can allow organizations and individuals to “evade traditional investigative measures.” King believes it is “necessary” to develop forensic tools and have the ability to acquire data from “virtual currency ledgers, online forums, peer-to-peer networks of underground markets, and seized devices.”\nThe group explains the consortium is backed by European law enforcement agencies and Interpol. Other members of the Titanium Project organization include Bundeskriminalamt (Germany), Coblue Cybersecurity (Netherlands), Universität Innsbruck (Austria) Interpol (International Criminal Police Organization), Ministry of the Interior (Austria), Ministry of the Interior (Spain) and the National Bureau of Investigation (Finland).\nOrganizers Say Titanium Tools Won’t Compromise Individual Privacy and Fundamental Rights\nTitanium Project organizers say that Bitcoin does have many legitimate use cases. However, the consortium explains that is still used by criminals and is very popular on the dark web. Furthermore, the consortium notes the latest ransomware attack on May 12 where the attackers froze computers throughout 150 countries and demanded bitcoin payments.\nKing also details the consortium wants the public to know that Titanium Project tools will also respect people’s privacy and other sovereign rights.\n“The consortium will analyse legal and ethical requirements and define guidelines for storing and processing data, information, and knowledge involved in criminal investigations without compromising citizen privacy,” King concludes in the European Commission announcement.\nWhat do you think about the European Commission’s Titanium Project?

    "text": "\n On June 5 Bitcoin has once again captured another all-time high touching $2860 across global exchanges. The decentralized currency’s price has jumped leaps and bounds since last week’s downturn.\nAlso read: Osforensics Founder Explains His Bitcoin Transaction Monitoring Tools\nBear Market Predictions Shunned as Bitcoin Bulls Take the Lead \nA lot has changed since the last time bitcoin’s price hit a high of $2760 on May 25 and subsequently dropped over 30 percent the next day. For a few days, the price hovered between the $2250-2350 range then made its first jump above $2400, shocking those who predicted a bearish downtrend. Many traders and even the analyst Nicola Duke, featured on CNBC, thought the forecast was for the worst. The price “could even fall as far as $1,470,” explained Duke’s prediction.\nThings have changed since then as bitcoin’s price has rallied consistently over the course of the week. After breaking the $2400 threshold, bitcoin’s value quickly escalated past $2500 into the $2600 territory for a short period. The price range of $2700 and above lasted for about an hour and a half until $2800 was breached. Bitcoin now commands a $46 billion dollar market capitalization and $1.6 billion worth of bitcoins has been traded over the past 24 hours.\n\n24-Hour Price Analysis \nTechnical indicators show the 100 Simple Moving Average is once again above the 200 SMA showing bulls are charging. Last week’s gap to the downside had seen buyers take a rest, but the action is now hotter than ever. Furthermore, Stochastic and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are also signaling very bullish patterns. Breaking higher targets in the next 24-48 hours is definitely a possibility but a trend backward beneath the sub-$2800 range could also happen. Order books are moving at light speed on the top exchanges and price in countries like Japan and Korea are once again showing higher price points.\n\nBitcoin Trending Higher Than Ever Before \nOverall positivity is high as far as the price is concerned, and this is leading to more mainstream attention focused on bitcoin. Online interest in bitcoin is also at an all-time high as Google Trends shows searches for bitcoin has surpassed 2013 records.\nBear Scenario: Bitcoin’s price is swinging, and there could be a few bear traps along the way. When bitcoin’s fiat value touched $2840, the price quickly dropped to $2795 ten minutes later but has since rebounded to newer highs. At the moment there is a significant floor between the $2500-2600 range, for the time being, if a deep correction takes place.\nBull Scenario: At the moment bulls are charging at full velocity with all of their force pushing the price higher. Reaching $3000 per bitcoin is not out of the question, and it could happen within the next 24-48 hours. At press time the buyers market is trying to escalate past the $2800 range into the $2900 territory.   \nWhat do you think about the price of bitcoin breaking $2800?

    "text": "\n Senate Bill 1241 defines digital currencies as “monetary instruments” and digital exchanges/tumblers as “financial institutions” for purposes of enforcing anti-money laundering laws. If successful, the “Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Counterfeiting Act” would inflict unhappy consequences on bitcoin freedom. [Note: for a section-by-section analysis of the bill, please click here. Section 13 deals directly with cryptocurrencies. The other sections become relevant only because 13 makes bitcoin fall under their purview.]\nAlso read: European Commission Launches Digital Currency and Dark Web Consortium\nSB1241 would have another impact that is less obvious but equally sweeping. Federal law is centralized law; that is, the same regulation is imposed equally on all states. Of course, the ideal is no regulation at all except for the community standards of businesses and users. But if bitcoin is to be regulated, then a patchwork of incompatible or differing laws is far more favorable to freedom than homogeneity. A network of decentralized authorities (states) may not constitute liberty but it does offer alternatives and escapes for those who seek greater freedom.\nThe Obvious Unhappy Consequences\nSection 13 of SB1241 is entitled “Prepaid Access Devices, Stored Value Cards, Digital Currencies, and Other Similar Instruments.” This would amend Section 5316 of Title 31 in two significant ways.\nFirst, 5316 currently states: “(2) ‘financial institution’ means—…(B) a commercial bank or trust company.” This would be amended to insert “or any digital exchange or tumbler of digital currency.” The news site Coindesk observes, “the bill clarifies that any ‘issuer, redeemer or cashier’ of a ‘digital currency’ is also covered.”\nSecond, a summary of the bill provided by co-sponsor Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) states,\nFunds stored in a digital format” would be included “within the definition of monetary instruments” making them subject to “anti-money laundering reporting requirements…where the value stored is above $10,000.\nIn other words, digital exchanges would become the equivalent of banks.\nParallel Institutions, The Less Obvious Unhappy Consequence\nHere, “institution” refers to a society or an organization. A “parallel institution” refers to a society or organization that acts as a counterbalance or competing authority to another organization, such as the federal government.\nParallel institutions have always benefited freedom-seekers, especially religious and political refugees. In the Middle Ages, Protestant dissenters fled Anglican England to find refuge in the Netherlands. Puritans colonized the New World and served as a beacon to others who sought religious liberty. The power of parallel institutions is captured by the principle of “sanctuary” by which a Church exercises a higher authority than the State and can refuse to surrender ‘criminals’ who seek refuge within its walls.\nThe political version of sanctuary plays out every day. People cross the border of one nation and escape into another. The second nation is not necessarily freer than the first but some aspect of it is freer to the refugee. Russia may not be freer than America, for example, but to Edward Snowden it is. The Ecuadorian embassy in London may be obscenely confining but it is more expansive than a prison cell to Julian Assange.\nParallel institutions also play an important practical role in the bitcoin community which is highly fluid and transplantable. In June 2015, a harsh licensing requirement for crypto businesses became law In New York with enforcement to begin in August. Many businesses chose to leave rather than abide by a license that required, among other things, the divulgence and sharing of customer data. Fortune magazine noted, “Last weekend the deadline to apply for a BitLicense came and went, and a slew of bitcoin startups went too—right out of New York State… This is not a comprehensive list, but here are some of the companies that packed up and left New York: Bitfinex, Bitquick, BTCGuild, Eobot, Genesis Mining, Gocoin, Kraken, Localbitcoins, Paxful, and Poloniex.”  Those who physically left did so by relocating to parallel institutions – that is, to other states with more palatable environments.\nThe power of parallel institutions is also seen through what happens when the two merge their interests and become, in effect, one institution. Instead of offsetting each other’s power, they buttress and increase it at the expense of individual freedom.\nWhen church and state speak with one voice, both become more oppressive; it was precisely because the Anglican Church was the state church of England that religious dissenters felt impelled to flee. In extreme cases, the melding of church and government can lead to an Inquisition. When capitalism and government blend their interests, the results are no less devastating. Crony capitalism is established; government and favored businesses grant each other privileges by which both grow rich by picking the pockets of average people. This bastardization of the free market is an efficient engine of oppression.\nS1241 is the federal government’s attempt to merge its power with that of the states and to homogenize that power under laws it enforces. There would be “one law to rule them all, one law to find them, one law to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.”\nMoving from state to state to escape a specific regulation is a relatively trivial task. Under SB1241 and the follow-on legislation it would inspire, physical bitcoin businesses would need to move internationally or shut down.\nConclusion\nSB1241 was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 25. This is the preliminary step before a bill can be introduced into the House or Senate for debate and, perhaps, a vote. In short, S1241 is in the earliest stage of legislation, and many bills never make it out of committee. If it does move forward, then the bill’s sweeping scope may be a barrier to passage in either the House or the Senate. On the other hand, the draft bill may deliberately express overreach in order to provide room for negotiation and compromise. And another terrorist attack on U.S. soil could create a political hysteria that the bill could ride into becoming law.\nOne thing is clear: S1241 is what some—and probably many—politicians want to impose on monetary instruments, including bitcoin, and financial institutions, including digital currency exchanges.\nA last point: S1241 mandates a report from Department of Homeland Security which is due 18 months after the bill’s passage. DHS is asked to detail “a strategy to detect prepaid access devices and digital currency at border crossings and ports of entry”. Travelling in and out of the U.S. with bitcoin could become a real problem. Currency control at the border is an indication of a government that is becoming or has become a totalitarian state.\nS1241 is a dot on the legal horizon. Whether or not it passes, this is the direction the state is pushing and will continue to push cyptocurrencies. Prepare now.\nWhat do you think bitcoin and other digital currencies will harmed SB1241? Do you believe there are ways to mitigate the damage?

    "text": "\n A resurgence in Chinese Bitcoin trading volume following huge growth in the Japanese and South Korean markets is forecasting a future where the US markets follow Asian price moves.\nAlso Read: Researcher from China’s Central Bank Discusses an ICO Regulatory Sandbox\nChina’s Bitcoin Markets Had Come To Resemble A Sleeping Giant In Recent Weeks\nChinese bitcoin exchange rates has taken a 3% price lead following announcements that two of the three ‘big exchanges’ in China will again be accepting deposits and withdrawals in fiat currencies.\n\nChina’s bitcoin markets had come to resemble a sleeping giant in recent weeks, following a crackdown on high leveraged margin trading by the PBOC earlier this year. The fall-out saw restriction being placed on the margin thresholds available to Chinese traders, and resulted in a 90% reduction in trading volume across the major Chinese exchanges.\nThe announcement that two of the exchanges have returned to operations as usual regarding deposits and withdrawals has been the catalyst for Bitcoin’s sharp rise in price over recent days, culminating in the establishment of a new all-time high of over 20,000 CNY – evidencing that China may be able to again rival Japan in the near future for market dominance, despite trading volume having not recovered since the crackdown.\nThe resurgence of Chinese bitcoin trading comes after a long period of dramatically rising growth of Bitcoin trading volume from major economic powers within the Asian region.\nDramatic Growth In Bitcoin User Adoption Throughout The Asian Region Is Forecasting An Increasingly Reduced Influence And Market Share Enjoyed By US Markets\nJapan rapidly rose to a position of dominance within Bitcoin starting in 2016, which has been assisted by the introduction of an extremely Bitcoin-friendly regulatory framework across the entire nation.\nIn South Korea bitcoin is currently trading at prices more than $1000 higher than current US prices, owing to the introduction of permissive regulations, significant increases in user adoption, and the inaccessibility for foreign citizens to access South Korean bank accounts.\nIndia also saw a dramatic surge in bitcoin usage towards the end of 2016, following an intensification of the war on cash in an attempt to centralize and restrict the financial freedoms of the nation’s most vulnerable citizens.\nThis dramatic growth in bitcoin user adoption throughout the Asian regions is forecasting an increasingly reduced influence and market share enjoyed by US markets, which briefly overtook China’s trading volume following the fallout from the PBOC interventions for the first time since 2013.\n\nDespite recent baby-steps toward more inclusive and fostering regulatory frameworks pertaining to Bitcoin on the part of Western governments, it appears that the Asian markets will increasingly dominate the cryptocurrency markets.\nDo you feel that the Bitcoin markets are moving into an era of Asian dominance over Western markets?  Tell us in the comments below!

    "text": "\n The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) announced on Wednesday that bitcoin will be used to buy a stake in a company listed on its exchange. Blockchain Global Limited (BGL) has agreed to buy a 40% interest in Digitalx, paying partly in bitcoins.\nAlso read: Bitcoin Double Taxation Ends in Australia July 1st\nThe First Case of Bitcoin Strategic Investment on ASX\nAccording to an announcement by the ASX, bitcoin will be used in a strategic investment on the exchange for the first time. The exchange wrote:\n\nFirst tranche funding through bitcoin – a first for the Australian Securities Exchange.\n\nThe agreement is between BGL and Digitalx, a blockchain-enhanced software solutions group listed on the ASX. Digitalx’s “Airpocket” application allows consumers to make secure and cost-effective money transfers worldwide.\nFounded in 2014 and formerly known as Bitcoin Group Limited, BGL provides Bitcoin mining, software, and consultancy services involving blockchain technology. The company has agreed to invest AUD$4.35 million at 2.7 cents per share to acquire roughly a 40% interest in Digitalx on a fully diluted basis.\nBGL is paying AUD$300,000 of the total investment by way of a convertible loan in bitcoin. Of the remaining $4.05 million, $550,000 will be paid via convertible notes and the rest in shares.\nThis investment is subject to shareholder approval and due diligence which would be done by June 30. If the shareholder approval is not obtained, Digitalx has agreed to pay BGL a break free penalty of AUD$100,000.\nPrevious Deal Between BGL and Digitalx\nBGL operates ACX.io which is Australia’s largest and most liquid bitcoin exchange by volume. According to the company’s CEO Sam Lee earlier this year, the exchange has 60 percent market share of the total bitcoin market trade volume in the country.\nIn February, BGL entered into a revenue sharing agreement with Digitalx to onboard customers of Digitalx Direct bitcoin exchange onto ACX.io. In return, Digitalx would receive 50% of all revenue generated from customers introduced to the ACX.io.\nAustralia Warming up to Bitcoin\nAustralia announced last month that bitcoin’s double taxation will end on July 1. After over a year of delay, the government finally included the removal of the double taxation of bitcoin in its 2017-2018 budget.\n“Currently, consumers who use digital currencies can effectively bear GST twice: once on the purchase of the digital currency and once again on its use in exchange for other goods and services subject to the GST,” the budget explains. Citing “the Government will make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia,” the budget details:\n\nFrom 1 July 2017, purchases of digital currency will no longer be subject to the GST, allowing digital currencies to be treated just like money for GST purposes.\n\nDo you think more companies will buy stakes in other companies using bitcoin?

    "text": "\n This week the financial analyst and precious metals proponent Andy Hoffman spoke with Greg Hunter from USAwatchdog.com concerning his opinion about the decline of our global economy. During the interview, Hoffman talked about the rise of cryptocurrencies and why he thinks bitcoin might be a game changer for the world.\nAlso read: Japan’s Bitpoint to Add Bitcoin Payments to 100,000+ Stores \n‘All the Market Manipulation and Money Printing is Dying’\nAndy Hoffman is a well-known financial analyst who believes the global economy is suffering from a significant depression with exponential debt. Hoffman details it’s difficult for the public to see these facts due to the stock market and other manipulated markets continuing to rise. “They have created ‘Dotcom valuations’ in an increasingly ‘Great Depression’ era, which, by the way, are only being enjoyed by 1% of the population,” explains Hoffman.\n\nThe largest most destructive Ponzi scheme is at its end. You can’t do anymore. They can’t say the economy is getting better — All the market manipulation and money printing is dying. All that’s going to be left is hyperinflation.\n\nHoffman is Bullish About Bitcoin, but the Technology Will Face Wars With Governments  \nAndy Hoffman, Financial Analyst.\nHoffman extensively discusses why he thinks precious metals are an excellent hedge against the current economic downturn taking place across the globe. Following his statements about precious metal markets, the analyst talks about cryptocurrencies and their recent rise in valuation over the past year. Hoffman says he is “bullish” about bitcoin but believes cryptocurrencies are still very young and “wildly volatile.”\n“As bullish as I am about bitcoin — Look they are in the middle of their scaling debate right now — They are going to have to go through the wars with the governments. Once the governments start to worry, like when the Chinese instituted capital controls on bitcoin back in January. They failed, but they can institute other ones. The U.S. could come in and say we are gonna ban it or shut down Coinbase and do all kinds of things to scare people.”\nHoffman continues to explain that these battles with the powers that be will make bitcoin volatile for the time being. One thing Hoffman notes is that it’s misleading when people say there is no “intrinsic value” in regards to bitcoin.\n\nTrust me the network effect plus the cost of mining is a major intrinsic value — But the fact is they are going to be wildly volatile.        \n\nBitcoin and Precious Metals Are Allies Fighting the Same Fight\nEven though cryptocurrencies have a lot of risks right now the analyst goes on to detail that precious metals and bitcoin are on the same team.\n“I wrote an article last May — ‘Precious Metals and Bitcoin: Twin Destroyers of the Fiat Regime,’ where I said they are allies. So when you have people on the precious metals side talking down about bitcoin 99 percent of them have no clue what they are talking about. They have done no research, they just view it as a competitor, and if they say bitcoin is bad it’ll go away, and everyone will ignore it.”\n\nNo, bitcoin is here to stay and whether it’s a total success or if it has problems along the way — cryptocurrencies are here to stay — In the big picture we should be thankful for cryptocurrency because it’s fighting the same fight but fighting it in a much different way, it’s like gorilla warfare because its decentralized and has less attack vectors.     \n\nFor instance, Hoffman highlights the fact that the authorities can’t confiscate bitcoin from those who are smart enough to hold their funds on hardware wallets. However, with all the focus on bitcoin from the media and its current rise in popularity, the governments will feel threatened. In fact, Hoffman believes because of the focus on cryptocurrencies it will help push up the value of precious metals markets as well. “Bitcoin is going to weaken their defenses against gold and silver,” Hoffman explains.\nBitcoin Is the One That Can Be a Game Changer\nAs far as alternative cryptocurrencies are concerned Hoffman says there will be a “tremendous amount of losers because a lot of them are scams, and a lot of them are just attracting hot money.”\n“So, you better do your research — The only one I have any faith in is bitcoin because it is the only one that can be a game changer for the world and the gold and silver market,” Hoffman concludes in his interview.\n\nWhat do you think about Andy Hoffman’s opinions about bitcoin and precious metal markets?

The proposals are expected to comprise an expansion upon current legislation applying to financial instruments like derivatives.\nRussia has come a long way in recent months with regards to its regulatory position on cryptocurrencies. Russia attracted great attention in early 2016 after considering introducing legislation that would to jail cryptocurrency users, following several years of erratic tooing-and-froing with regards to bitcoin’s legal status.\nRussia Has Taken Further Steps Towards Embracing Cryptocurrency\nIn December 2016 a Russian Federal Tax Service Letter surfaced that implied cryptocurrencies are not prohibited.\nFurther clarity was provided in April of this year when reports surfaced that Russian Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev had announced Russian intentions to recognize Bitcoin as a legitimate financial instrument during 2018 in a bid to fight money laundering.\nSince April, Russia has taken further steps towards embracing cryptocurrency. In May, Russia’s largest online retailer Ulmart announced that it would be incrementally moving toward accepting bitcoin payments for select items, just weeks before Olga Skorobogatova, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Russia, revealed a proposal to classify bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as ‘digital goods’ for taxation purposes. The move was well received by Russia’s banking sector, with the head of Sberbank German Gref issuing a statement that expressed his desire to have a sensible and pragmatic discussion with regards to cryptocurrencies, as previous attempts to prohibit virtual currencies had been largely problematic.\n\nIn recent weeks The Kremlin has appeared to hasten their move toward integrating cryptocurrency into the Russian economy. During June Vladimir Putin met with Vitalik Buterin – who was invited to speak at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. During the event, Central Bank Deputy Governor Skorobogatova confirmed rumors that the central bank is developing its own digital currency. The forum took place after a recent announcement by Skorobogatova that the Central Bank and Eurasian Economic Community would be embarking upon a joint project to use blockchain technology for financial services.\nMany analysts are suggesting that recent moves on the part Russia and major alternate economic powers’ toward exploring more permissive bitcoin regulations show a recognition that cryptocurrencies can be used as a means to disrupt the economic status quo, which is currently one of US hegemony.\nIn the last year Japan, India, South Korea, Iran and South Africa have all seen dramatic increases in cryptocurrency adoption, and most have responded by introducing permissive regulatory frameworks that will foster further development within the emerging cryptocurrency industry.\nAs the US’s share of the cryptocurrency increasingly wanes, many in the experts are speculating that the current international cryptocurrency landscape comprises a reflection of broader shifts in the global economy.\nDo you think that Russia will be able to effectively regulate the cryptocurrency industry?

    "text": "\n US lawmakers have been urged to take action against unlicensed offshore bitcoin exchanges, following a subcommittee hearing within the House of Representatives. The hearing, “Virtual Currency: Financial Innovation and National Security Implications”, is being hosted by the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee.\nAlso Read: Financial Analyst Andy Hoffman Says We Should Be Thankful for Bitcoin\nThe Absence of KYC Guidelines and Identity Verification On Many Exchanges Were Stressed as a Major Issue\nThe growing proliferation of ransomware attacks that utilize cryptocurrency technology has led US lawmakers to again focus upon the potential negative use cases for blockchain technology. Representatives were told that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies being increasingly used to fuel illicit activities are easily accessible via unregulated cryptocurrencies hosted outside of the United States. An emphasis was placed upon unlicensed exchanges being used as a vehicle for money laundering, terrorism, and cybercrime.\n The absence of KYC guidelines and identity verification on many exchanges were stressed as a major issue. “Criminals can open anonymous accounts, or accounts with phony names to fly under the radar of law enforcement,” said Kathryn Haun, former Assistant US Attorney and current lecturer at Stanford University. “Thus, we have received ‘Mickey Mouse who resides at ‘123 Main Street’ in subpoena returns”.\nMany of the Issues Raised Have Little Evidence Supporting the Need For a Greater Focus On Crimes Committed Involving Cryptocurrency, Than Crimes Committed Using Dollars\nThe US House Financial Services Committee hearing has taken place just months after the FBI was granted legal jurisdiction to hack any computer in the world that is deemed to be connected via a ‘network’ to a computer for which the FBI has a warrant authorization infiltration. This prompts some to interpret the rhetoric as a possible pre-meditated justification for considering using said jurisdiction to clamp down on unregulated bitcoin transactions internationally. “We must find a way to target these criminal currency exchanges, often sheltered in countries where officials protect and even profit from them”, said Scott Dueweke, president of The Identity and Payments Association.\n\nDemocratic Representative Ed Permutter of Colorado recognized the widespread use of cash and money transmitting services as also being vehicles for illicit activities, but argued that law enforcement possesses the regulatory means to prosecute and punish those who use such to break the law.\nMany of the issues raised have little evidence supporting the need for a greater focus on crimes committed involving cryptocurrency, than for crimes committed using dollars. There is scant evidence that more than $1,000 has been donated to terrorist groups using bitcoin, and the anonymizing capabilities of the technology are often overstated. The public nature of all blockchain wallet values makes it easy for law enforcement to track the movements of funds identified to have been involved with criminal activities – an overt downside of attempting to use bitcoin as a vehicle for nefarious activities. It is also worth noting that many hackers and scammers have had their funds seized by exchanges when attempting to convert their cryptocurrency into fiat (including the shadowy and anonymously operated BTC-E) – suggesting that the cryptocurrency network possesses some internal means to alienate and punish those who seek to use bitcoin for clandestine purposes.

    "text": "\n Reports have emerged detailing the alleged forceful cessation of large-scale bitcoin mines in China’s southwest, with insiders quoting a lack of state-sanctioned regulatory policy regarding cryptocurrency mining as the official reasoning cited for such.\nAlso Read: Russian Government To Introduce KYC Guidelines For Cryptocurrency Purchases\nThe Closures Come at a Critical Moment for Mining Businesses, as Bitcoin’s Price Has Tripled over the Course of 2017\nThe absence of government-backed regulation over the practice of bitcoin mining has apparently prompted the Chinese central government to forcefully influence the cessation of many commercial bitcoin mining operations in Sichuan.\nChina’s province of Sichuan has attracted great interest from bitcoin investors and entrepreneurs in recent years, as the province has abundant access to hydropower and offers huge savings in electricity costs for mining businesses that operate in Sichuan.\n\nThe closures come at a critical moment for mining businesses, as Bitcoin’s price has tripled over the course of 2017. “The price is so high at the moment,” said a bitcoin mine manager in an interview with Yicai Global, “shutting down costs mine owners hundreds of thousands of yuan every day.”\nThe reports appear at odds with the Chinese government’s recent to decision to again allow deposits and withdrawals in fiat currencies to be processed by the country’s major exchanges. The moves come ahead of announcements that The People’s Bank of China will roll out regulatory measures for bitcoin trading designed to prevent money laundering in June.\nFor China, a Regulated Bitcoin Trading Industry Will Generate Wealth That Will Be Under the Control of the Chinese State\n“Bitcoin regulation that the central bank conducted mainly focused on financing and leveraging trading among platforms,” Zhang Jun, a senior analyst at Tai Cloud Research Institute, told Yicai Global. Sichuan officials echoed this sentiment, also stating that “mining is carried out by companies of their own accord” – implying that mining businesses have taken it upon themselves to act outside of the legal apparatus provided by the Chinese government.\nThe move by China to regulate cryptocurrency trading but crack down on mining appears contradictory at first, but closer analysis of the marxist principles that underpinned the origins of the Chinese central government’s economic policies illuminate a logic to adopting these positions. For China, a regulated bitcoin trading industry will generate wealth that will be under the control of the Chinese state. The industry will be under the control of the central government, and investors would predominantely represent individuals who are already living in cities that are integrated into the contemporary Chinese state-capitalist societal mode.\n\nMining, on the other hand, will likely flourish in areas such as Sichuan, provinces outside of the major Chinese economic center that are yet to be fully developed and integrated into the contemporary Chinese economy, that can also offer investors abundant access to cheap electricity. This could pose great challenges to China’s attempt to further develop and centralize the vast populations that exist outside of China’s developed core, as greater access to blockchain technology could facilitate the emergence of a myriad of localized, informal economies operating outside of the control of the Chinese government.\nContinued Contradictory Stances Likely\nFor a state whose legitimacy and existence depends upon delivering services with the greatest possible efficiency through the use of a centralized state apparatus, the risk of the economic liberation and autonomy made possible of bitcoin penetrating those provinces that are more autonomously governed is a threat that will be taken seriously.\nThe move toward holding two seemingly contradictory stances is likely to be indicative of future stances held by the Chinese government regarding cryptocurrency. It is very likely that the government will seek to guide those components of the cryptocurrency industry that will adapt well to China’s current economic landscape and regulation. This while forcefully restricting the development of the components of the cryptocurrency economy that may undermine China’s ability to centralize and control the economies of the entire Chinese landmass.\nDo you think Chinese regulators will be able to prohibit commercial mining operations, or do you think the Chinese bitcoin mining industry will continue to operate underground?  Tell us your thought below!

    "text": "\n The price of bitcoin has been surging over the weekend almost touching $3000 per BTC on Sunday, June 11 across most global exchanges. The following day roughly around 6:30 am bitcoin’s price took a steep decline dropping to a low of $2700 but has since bounced back a touch after the dip.\nAlso Read: Russian Government To Introduce KYC Guidelines For Cryptocurrency Purchases\nBitcoin Comes Close to $3K, but Highs Were Followed by a Steep Correction\nDuring the weekend throughout June 10-11 bitcoin’s price seemed to be forming a strong consolidation in the $2970-2980 range. It tried to cross the $3000 mark multiple times (it did on a couple of exchanges) with little success as the price per BTC topped a high of $2980 on the trading platform Bitstamp. After that, the June 12th morning dip seemed rather unexpected and looked to be merely some profit-taking for the time being. At press time the price has rebounded and is sitting roughly around the $2775 mark.\n\n‘The Flippening’\nOne of the most topical discussions at the moment is the market capitalization of Ethereum (ETH) and the possibility of it surpassing bitcoin’s market cap. Ethereum had a pretty good weekend jumping from $300 to $420 across most exchanges. This has led to the ethereum market capturing roughly 78 percent of bitcoin’s valuation in what a lot of people are referring to as the ‘flippening.’ Currently as far as a flippening is concerned ethereum has already surpassed bitcoin trade volumes, mining reward and even 24-hour transaction volume. As of right now, ETH market dominance is 32 percent, and BTC is 40 percent among the 870 cryptocurrencies in existence.\n24-Hour Price Analysis\nLooking at the charts on Bitstamp bitcoin’s price is trying to regain ground at the moment. Technical indicators are showing the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is still above the 200 SMA — which is a good sign showing the gap may indicate more bullish trends in the future. Right now order books on Bitstamp are moving faster than the eye can catch but there are big sell walls in the 2850 range and there are even larger walls above this mark. Both the Stochastic and Relative Strength Index (RSI) levels show a healthy correction was due and bulls will remain on the sidelines for better entry points. It’s safe to assume Bitcoin trading markets will be quite volatile over the next 24-hours and day traders, and intra-range players should have a field day scalping profits.\nThe June 12th dip on the Bitstamp exchange 10:15 am EST.\nJust an Average Day in the Land of Cryptocurrency\nOverall things have been quite positive within the cryptocurrency space, and the correction has taken place across most crypto-markets after a few digital assets touched all-time highs. Mainstream media is reporting about bitcoin’s rising price but are also speculating on the performance of ethereum markets. The likelihood of bitcoin breaking the $3000 range and finding new highs is not out of the question, as we’ve seen corrections like this on multiple times over the past two months. Alongside this, at the token’s current rate of growth, the possibility of Ethereum experiencing a larger market capitalization than bitcoin is also a possibility.\nBear Scenario: The price of bitcoin has dipped quite a bit since the June 11 high to a low of $2700. At the moment bears seem like they are having a hard time pulling down the price further but it’s possible they could bring BTC down to the $2600 range. At the moment there is a strong foundation between $2600-2700, but the price could go lower if psychological patterns cause panic.\nBull Scenario: Bitcoin’s price looks as though it just received a healthy correction and bulls have possibly pulled the elastic back once again to set up for the next spring upwards. The price per BTC could easily break the $3000 mark, as we’ve seen after every correction there have been higher follow-ups in price. Trade volume is healthy with over $2 billion worth of BTC traded daily, and higher price points are achievable even in the short term. \nWhat do you think about the price coming close to $3000 then toppling back down into the $2700 range?

This trend has quickly doubled assets under management to over the $100 million threshold.\n\nInterest in bitcoin from institutional investors has recently increased. Bitcoin.com reported last week on how hedge funds are quietly investing in the digital currency. A couple of days later, Goldman Sachs started covering bitcoin due to popular demand from its hedge fund clients.\nBoth ETNs are designed to mirror the return of bitcoin. One is denominated in Swedish krona (SEK) and the latter in the euro (EUR). They are listed on the NASDAQ/OMX exchange in Stockholm and both are available in 179 countries.\nPartnership with Xapo\nIn Thursday’s announcement, XBT Provider also revealed a custodial partnership with Xapo. Bitcoins held in cold storage on behalf of investors in the two ETNs will now be secured by Xapo. In January, the Zug-based company received conditional approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to operate in Switzerland.\nXBT Provider’s Head of Investor Relations, Ryan Radloff, said, “the addition of Xapo to our infrastructure is a critical step in ensuring that our products remain the most professional bitcoin investment products available to investors, globally.”\nXapo is also the custodian of Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) which is currently seeking approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to become a bitcoin ETF.\nDo you think institutional investors will continue to invest in bitcoin ETNs?

    "text": "\n After testing $3000 USD, bitcoin entered a sharp retracement which saw several major bitcoin exchanges experience significant technical difficulties.\nAlso Read: Poloniex Suffers Attacks Seeing 600% More Active Traders in 2017\nThe Problems Experienced by Exchanges May Have Contributed to the Intensity of Yesterday’s Crash\nAll eyes have been on bitcoin in recent days, as btc ramped up to establish new highs and test the key area of $3000. When the area failed to hold prices began to retrace – triggering a crash of up to approx. 20 percent in just a few hours. Kraken, Coinbase, Gdax, and Poloniex were all reported to be experiencing technical difficulties during the crash – leaving many traders unable to manage or exit their positions.\nThe problem of cryptocurrency exchanges experiencing technical difficulties has been a persistent theme throughout 2017’s dramatic bull trend. Following a 600% rise in trading activity and several ddos attacks, Poloniex has had numerous issues in recent months. Complaints of slow loading speeds and trade executions, drastic slippage, and errors while attempting to log in during critical periods of high volatility have been widespread. Coinbase, Gdax, and Kraken have garnered criticism from traders too, with reports of users struggling to access their accounts during moments of intense volatility during bitcoin’s recent uptrend being widespread.\n\nThe problems experienced by exchanges may have contributed to the intensity of yesterday’s crash. Coinbase, Gdax, Kraken, and Poloniex all experience difficulties during the same period, resulting in a significant number of traders having found themselves locked out of their accounts. The threat of being unable to manage one’s accounts during a period of intense volatility sends emotions running high, prompting many traders to close their positions and cancel open orders to minimize risk exposure in case they are unable to manage their trades. This intensifies aggressive price moves like yesterday’s crash, as traders simultaneously race to exit the markets.\nThe Difficulties Experienced by Exchanges Have Consistently Posed a Challenge to Bitcoin’s Path Towards Mainstream Adoption\nLast night’s problems again highlight the need for new or inexperienced traders to exercise caution when first participating in the bitcoin markets, as getting locked out of one’s account whilst in a heavily leveraged position may incur the risk of liquidation.\nThe difficulties experienced by exchanges have consistently posed a challenge to bitcoin’s path towards mainstream adoption. The troubles experienced by exchanges have continued to be a major catalyst for unexpected price moves, as evidenced by the hacking of Bitstamp in 2015 that triggered the $166 low of the post-2013 China-bubble sell-off, and the slew of problems experienced by Bitfinex that triggered a major reversal during June 2016.\n\nWith bitcoin’s user base showing exponential growth in recent months, issues such as those experienced last night are likely to become more frequent if a serious effort is not made by exchanges to ensure that periods of high volatility do not overload trading engines. An extra impetus should be placed upon industry leaders such as Coinbase to rectify these issues, who have recently sought a $1 billion USD valuation.\nWhat bitcoin exchange do you use and why?

    "text": "\n Between the 12th and 15th of June, bitcoin lost approximately 30% of it’s value, seeing the largest dollar-value retracement across 4 days in bitcoin’s history of approximately $900 – $950 USD on both USD market leading exchanges Bitstamp and Bitfinex.\nThe Past 7 Days Has Seen Bitcoin Experience Both Record-Breaking Price Gains, and Record-Breaking Price Losses\nAlso Read: Markets Update: Bitcoin Price Cools Down After Slight Correction\n2017 has been an incredible year for bitcoins and cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s price saw a 300% increase from the start of the year, and many altcoins have seen meteoric rises.\nFor bitcoin, it has been a year of records. The past 7 days has seen bitcoin experience both record-breaking price gains, and record-breaking price losses – with Bitstamp and Bitfinex dropping from approximately $3000 USD to test a low in the $2100 area.\nFrom the break of bitcoin’s preceding $1200 all-time to the establishment of $3000 as the local top, bitcoin had seen a spike in price that reached the 2.68 Fibonacci extension area.\n\nThis last week has seen price retrace down the 50 percent retracement area of the bull run from the previous all-time high, with the current price action appearing to be heading for a retest of the 78.6 Fibonacci retracement area of approximately $2600.\n\nHealthy Retracement or Dead Cat Bounce?\nThe trading community now appears to be anxiously awaiting to see whether or not the current price action will come to comprise a healthy retracement, or a dead cat bounce.\nYesterday’s test of $2100 USD established an ascending trend-line on the 4-hour chart, signifying that the bull run may not be over. However, whether or not bitcoin can establish a new high remains to be seen, with many traders expecting the current bounce to encounter significant resistance in the $2600 – $2700 USD range. Should a lower top form, the question will be whether or not bitcoin can again bounce off the ascending trend-line and begin to form a symmetrical triangle formation, or it will break the trend-line and potentially form a head and shoulders formation. \nAltcoin Markets Shed Dollar-Value\nAlthough many of the altcoin markets, especially Ethereum, have seen dramatic price rises and record-breaking growth in total market capitalization, the recent reversal of the historic inverse correlation between bitcoin and altcoin price movements has seen other cryptocurrency markets lose dollar-value alongside bitcoin. As a consequence, ETH, ZEC, ETC, XMP, XRP, DASH, and REP all saw dollar-value losses off approximately 30% or higher alongside bitcoin between the 12th and 15th of June.\nAlthough Ethereum looks as though it may be able to rival bitcoin’s total market capitalization, recent bitcoin volatility has seen ETH suffer significant dollar-value losses. During bitcoin’s 30% retracement from May 25-27, Ethereum lost 50% of its dollar-value, leading some to question the ability for Ethereum to sustain its dramatic growth long-term should bitcoin’s momentum begin to reverse.\nDo you think that bitcoin will continue to break new highs?

The meeting was arranged by BitKan in order to allow bitcoin investors and professionals to come together to build shared trust and understanding. \nAlso read: Central Bank of Samoa Issues Warning Against Digital Currency\nThe meeting is a result of the fact that Chinese online exchanges again have resumed withdrawals. Kevin Helms, writing for bitcoin.com covered the issue, saying, “Chinese bitcoin exchanges have reportedly resumed bitcoin withdrawals. Customers of BTCC, Huobi, and Okcoin can now withdraw their coins up to certain daily limits.” He continued, “Following the inspections by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), BTCC, Huobi, and Okcoin halted coin withdrawals in February. Almost four months later, on Wednesday May 31, at least two of them reportedly lifted their cryptocurrency withdrawal suspensions.”\nChinese Bitcoin Ecosystem Talks OTC’s and Exchanges\nIt appears that since the withdrawals started, OTC exchanges have declined…but Chinese traders and business people do not want OTC trades to stop. This was one of the important facets of the meeting. The event page on Bitkan’s Facebook noted the event and mentioned what topics they would focus on. Aspects of the talk included:\n1.What are the risks in OTC trading? How to avoid them?\n2.Under the Chinese government’s policy regulation, what’s the prospect of OTC trading?\n3.What are the differences between exchanges and OTC? What are the respective advantages?\n4.What’s the situation of OTC trading outside of China?",

    "text": "\n Bitpesa founder and CEO, Elizabeth Rossiello, has claimed that bitcoin-based remittance services have reduced the costs of international payments by 75%, and reduced the average time of settlement from 12 days to approximately 12 hours. Rossiello also discussed the African cryptocurrency economy and changing attitudes towards bitcoin on the part of major international financial institutions and mainstream media outlets.\nAlso Read: Bitmari Becomes First Bitcoin Company to Partner With an African Commercial Bank\nBitpesa CEO, Elizabeth Rossiello, Claims Bitpesa Has Transformed the African Remittance Industry\nBitpesa was created in 2013 and has achieved significant success providing a cheaper, faster remittance service to African markets than Moneygram or Western Union.\nBitpesa CEO, Elizabeth Rossiello, claims that Bitpesa has transformed the African remittance industry and created positive change across the African continent. “Bitpesa was the first company in the world to establish a market between African currencies and digital currencies. We lowered the cost of international payments by 75% and reduced the time to settle between currencies from 12 days to less than 2 hours.”\n\nBitpesa currently primarily operates in Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya, and Tanzania, and has headquarters in Luxembourg. The company is licensed in the UK by the FCA. Aside from offering services to individuals and small businesses, Bitpesa claims that numerous multi-national corporations rely on their services to circumvent inefficient and unreliable payment settlements that plague the African financial sector.\nFor Rossiello, Africa offers a unique opportunity to bitcoin and cryptocurrency services. The lack of economic development and poor juridical apparatus associated with Africa begs for the types of services that bitcoin and cryptocurrency can offer.\n\nThere has been such an under-investment in infrastructure for so long in Africa, there was a lot of opportunity to bring efficiency into this market. It’s a big opportunity.\n\nAfrica Citizens Are Starting to See Expansion in the Bitcoin-Based Remittance Services\nRossiello also discussed the changing attitudes held toward bitcoin by major international financial and super-national organizations, as well as the mainstream media. “There was a big misconception repeated in the media about the technology being less safe – despite the fact that the Bank of England, the World Economic Forum and the IMF have all conducted research stating the technology has a low-risk for fraud, certainly much less than cash and traditional transfer methods. The technology is here to stay and the tone has begun to change in the media. Making global payments using the bitcoin blockchain is safer, more efficient, and cheaper.”\n\nCitizens accross the african continent are starting to see an expansion in the bitcoin-based remittance services offered that are available to them. Vietnamese based/African incorporated remittance service provider Remitano has recently expanded its services into the Nigerian, Kenyan, and Tanzanian markets, moving to directly compete for Bitpesa’s market share.\nAlthough the positive benefits from bitcoin-based remittance providers operating in Africa are undeniable, it should be noted the majority of major companies are based off-shore – resulting in a minor maintenance of the ‘foreign-based money transmitters profiting from African labor’ business model that cryptocurrency remittances were seemingly destined to annihilate during the wide-eyed infancy of bitcoin.\nThe recent announcement that Zimbabwe based remittance company Bitmari has become the first bitcoin company to work in partnership with an African commercial bank comprises excellent news for the African bitcoin remittance industry. African companies developing an early foothold within the bitcoin remittance-space would drive much needed economic dynamism on the African continent, and potentiate a total recapture of the capital lost through the process of international money transmission on the part of the African economy.\nDo you think that bitcoin-based remittance services are having a positive impact on Africa’s economy?

Being able to garner the loyalty of new users could give the company a significant advantage over its competitors, as successful new traders will be likely to trade other financial products offered by Ayondo.\n\nAlthough the recent proliferation of CFD brokers moving to offer bitcoin pairings will expose new audiences to bitcoin’s profit potential, the cryptocurrency community must be cautious in welcoming a greater presence from conventional CFD brokers.\nTrading bitcoin via derivative markets such divorces the cryptocurrency from its underlying use-values. The benefits of fluid, frictionless circulation of capital, complete financial autonomy and the neutralization of counterparty risk are all negated by trading an abstract expression of bitcoin’s exchange-value as opposed to bitcoin itself. The mainstream financial markets will be more than happy to profit from traders who do not possess the patience for learning the technical basics required to safely store and manage one’s bitcoin autonomously.\nDo you think that CFD brokers can rival the presence of major bitcoin exchanges for cryptocurrency trading market share?

    "text": "\n An article posted in Forbes’ Level-Up encouraged its readers to buy into bitcoin, despite bitcoin’s price currently sitting within range of its all-time high, following gains of several hundreds of percent over the course of the preceding year. The Forbes owned magazine’s article highlights a consistent pattern among mainstream media outlets’ coverage of cryptocurrency, in which cryptocurrency is sidelined and ignored whilst its price is low, before news organizations rally hype for bitcoin investment after meteoric price gains have already been made.\nAlso Read: News Outlets and Journalists Are Being Threatened By Onecoin Lawyers\nMainstream Media Has a Tendency to Dismiss Bitcoin While Its Price Is Low Before Hyping It After A Boom\nThroughout the nascent years of cryptocurrency bitcoin received scant coverage in the press, with the exception of few niche technology publications. For several years bitcoin evaded extensive coverage in the mainstream press, until the darknet hosted anonymous free-market The Silk Road began to garner attention for facilitating the sale of illegal narcotics using bitcoin as its currency. A spattering of news outlets speculated about the potential for bitcoin’s use a vehicle for money laundering, terrorist financing and narcotics sales. Soon after, however, bitcoin stunned the world with meteoric price gains after unusually harsh austerity measures were being forced upon the nation of Cyprus during 2014. A resulting flood of citizens seeking to convert their savings into any store of value that could evade government seizure drove bitcoin prices from $40 USD to $260 USD.\n\nThe rest of 2013 saw many obituaries for bitcoin published by mainstream news outlets, before bitcoin again shocked the world be rallying past $1000 USD following a sudden flood of Chinese entrants into the cryptocurrency markets. The subsequent popping of the China bubble saw a slow year-long grind back to sub-$200 USD prices, seeing the majority of mainstream media publications dismiss the bitcoin bubble as a digital contemporary ‘Tulip Mania’ that would never be heard from again.\nThe tendency for mainstream news outlets to dismiss bitcoin while its price is low before hyping cryptocurrency after it has boomed has become routine since the 2013 China bubble. The article published by Forbes in Level-Up in recent days titled ‘How To Buy Bitcoin, Now That It’s Reached An All-Time High’ echoes this familiar sentiment. The opening paragraph states that “the price for one coin has spiked to about $2,900. If you haven’t already, now is the time to buy in”.\nNew Investors Must Recognize the Flippancy of Cryptocurrency Reporting in the Mainstream Media\nThe area of $2,900 turned out to be a local top, with USD prices on Bitstamp forging a new all-time high of $2980, before a dramatic retracement that saw the largest 4-day loss of dollar-value in bitcoin’s history to retest $2100 USD. The price has partially recovered back to approximately $2600, leaving readers of Level-Up who may have purchased above $2900 holding position losses of over 10%, assuming that they resisted panic selling at prices closer to $2100.\n\nThis type of reporting has a dramatic effect on the bitcoin markets. Floods of new investors often rush into the cryptocurrency markets after seeing waves of positive mainstream press coverage. This glut of new investment typically drives prices parabolic, creating unsustainable price gains and triggering the very volatility that the mainstream press cites in rejecting bitcoin’s practical use as a currency. Once gravity catches up to the price parabola, the press quickly changes its tone and returns to forecasting the inevitability of bitcoin’s demise. This reporting destabilizes the cryptocurrency markets and places new investors at risk, as many new cryptocurrency participants have no prior experience with trading in the financial markets.\nNew investors must recognize the flippancy of cryptocurrency reporting in mainstream media and avoid looking to such as a source of financial advice. Many publications cover bitcoin in order to capitalize on the spikes in cryptocurrency-related search engine queries that are typically produced by major news events or price actions within the cryptocurrency markets. The result is often poorly researched, hastily produced clickbait authored by journalists with little or no long-term experience with financial markets or cryptocurrency. Using this form of journalism as a source of investment advice is very risky, and new participants in the bitcoin markets should seek education from a variety of sources that have a demonstrated history of accurate reporting the cryptocurrency industries.\n\nDo you think that mainstream news outlets hyping bitcoin after it has boomed influences inexperienced traders to make risky trades?

    "text": "\n United States-based bitcoin investment firm, Pantera Capital, has filed with the U.S Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) for an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) hedgefund.\nAlso Read: SEC Eyes Initial Coin Offerings for Regulatory Oversight\nIf Successful, Pantera ICO Fund LP Will Be the World’s First ICO Hedgefund\nPantera Capital is hoping to become the first bitcoin investment firm to offer an ICO hedgefund. The Pantera ICO Fund LP plans to offer investors a diversified and third-party managed means to speculate on upcoming initial coin offerings, claiming to mitigate much of the risk associated with investing in pre-market cryptocurrency projects.\n Pantera Capital was formed in 2013, comprising the first US-based bitcoin investment firm. The company has invested in numerous cryptocurrency heavyweights, including blockchain-based remittance service Abra, leading South Korean bitcoin exchange Korbit, and altcoins Ripple and Zcash. Pantera CEO Dan Morehead and Auger co-founder Joey Krug will be chief investment officers for the fund, with Krug now joining Pantera Capital as a full-time employee.\nIn a recent interview with Techcrunch, Joey Klug, Dan Morehead, and Pantera Capital partner Paul Veradittakit articulated their intentions for the ICO hedge fund. The ICO hedgefund will have a preference for investing in “protocols where the token is integral to the functioning of the service itself… where tokens are the only exposure to the network.” Ideally Pantera will invest in projects where the development team has experience with “buil[ding] an open source community on a large scale”, with the fund planning to hold tokens for between ten and twenty projects at any one time. Pantera are also planning on having direct engagement with the projects that they invest in, with Paul Veradittaki stating that “[Pantera will] help provide the right connections, whether in terms of marketing or recruiting or business development.” Where possible, the fund hopes to be the largest participant in the projects it invests in.\nDan Morehead suspects that ICOs may come to supersede traditional VC firms, describing such as the principal motivation behind Pantera’s ICO fund. “In [2017’s] second quarter, ICO issuance was greater than venture capital, with $210 million [invested in ICOs] versus $180 million [invested into startups by VC firms. We do expect that transition to continue.”\nPantera’s Filing With the SEC Comes Before a Clear Regulatory Apparatus Has Been Developed for Initial Coin Offerings\nThe fund will be open to private and institutional US-based investors, offering a means for many venture capital firms to participate in the ICO markets that are otherwise unable to directly invest in cryptocurrency projects due to company policies. The company plans to open up to non-US investors in the future.\n\nPantera’s filing with the SEC comes before a clear regulatory apparatus has been developed for initial coin offerings. Recent controversies surrounding particular cryptocurrency pre-sales have been prompting experts to forecast the inevitability of a regulatory crackdown on ICOs. Recent reports have evidenced that the SEC is actively looking at ICOs, citing a lack of transparency and oversight as areas of concern. Despite such, Dan Morehead and Pantera Capital are confident that Pantera ICO Fund LP will be able to comfortably adapt to future regulations. “All these new currencies are along a spectrum and have various attributes, and various regulatory bodies around the world, including the CFTC and the IRS, have taken clear stances on them already. Other agencies haven’t ruled on them, but I think it’ll be the same with token sales, where there will be a period of time where they figure out how they fit into existing regimes or whether new regimes are needed to regulate token sales.”\nThe firm is currently in the process of a $100 million fundraising campaign for the venture, having already successfully secured over $25 million.\nDo you think that Pantera’s ICO hedgefund will have positive implications for the cryptocurrency economy?

According to the agency’s announcement on Wednesday, among the topics discussed this year was the use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as a store of value and as a legitimate payment method.\nAlso read: Rollout of 260,000+ Bitcoin-Accepting Stores in Japan Begins\nEuropol Discusses Bitcoin’s Legitimate Uses This Year\nEuropol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) recently organized the “4th Virtual Currencies Conference,” hosted at the Europol’s headquarters in The Hague. EC3 was set up in 2013 as the EU’s cybercrime specialist unit to help law enforcement respond to cyber attacks.\nThe event, which took place on June 22 and 23, aimed “to further strengthen the fight against the abuse of virtual currencies for criminal transactions and money laundering.” This was also the same theme of the 3rd Virtual Currencies Conference which took place on July 14-15 last year.\nHowever, unlike previous years, Europol has added other discussions to the conference. According to the agency’s announcement on Wednesday:\n\nAnother interesting topic covered was the legitimate use of Bitcoin technology, including the use of cryptocurrencies as a store of value, and as a payment method for legitimate goods and services.\n\nBitcoin Industry Experts Invited\nThe event was attended by over 150 experts from various fields this year. Many law enforcement authorities in both European countries and non-EU countries returned, but this time experts from the private sector were also invited. Many Bitcoin companies were chosen to attend because they specialize in “facilitating the lawful use of virtual currencies by providing online exchange, payment processing or wallet services.” According to Europol, the industry experts that attended include Bitcoin.de, Bitfinex, Bitpanda, Bitonic, Bitstamp, Bitpay, Coinbase, Cubits, Localbitcoins, Spectrocoin and Xapo.\nThe announcement states that “the participants shared their insights into criminal trends and the latest techniques used by criminals to hide their financial tracks and cash out criminal proceeds using bitcoins and other virtual currencies.”\nEU’s Research on Bitcoin as Store of Value\nThe EU has done significant research regarding digital currency as a store of value. Over time, their researchers found that bitcoin has increasingly gained more acceptance as a store of value.\nA 2015 European Commission report detailed how bitcoin has two features as a store of value, which differ substantially from traditional currencies. They are “non-inflationary supply and cyber security.” The author wrote, “bitcoin is the protection against inflation as a safe haven from government interference.” However, as a store of value, the report noted that “Bitcoin sensitivity to cyber-attacks and thefts reduces trust in bitcoin as a currency and hence impedes its growth and chances of becoming a global currency.”\nMeanwhile, The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has noted that “non-payment uses of virtual currencies may include store-of-value products for savings or investment purposes, such as derivatives, commodities, and securities products.” This view has been referenced by the European Central Bank and other agencies.\nThen in May this year, the European Parliament’s Directorate-General for Internal Policies report stated that “Once trading of the digital currency in exchange for sovereign currency begins, there will be a positive market price or exchange rate.” In addition, the report detailed “With digital currencies becoming more popular as a medium of exchange and also as a store of value, various asset substitutions take place. Households will reduce their cash holdings as they will start to make some payments with the digital currency.”\nWhat do you think the Europol will do about Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "text": "\n Spanish bitcoin payment platform, Bitnovo, has announced the addition of 4000 new locations allowing customers to purchase bitcoin using cash in Spain.\nAlso Read: Spanish University Holds Two-Day Bitcoin & Blockchain Course\n2017 Has Been a Big Year for Bitnovo\nBitnovo has revealed the launch of 4,000 new physical locations throughout Spain via Twitter this week. The outlets will allow customers to directly exchange fiat currency for bitcoin. Bitnovo’s expansion comprises an 800% increase in the number of locations previously available in Spain, of which there were approx. 500 prior to the rollout.\n\n2017 has been a big year for Bitnovo, with the company’s bitcoin Visa prepaid debit card also being launched in 130 countries. The move signifies Bitnovo’s expansion beyond the Spanish cryptocurrency market and desire to establish itself as a major international brand within the bitcoin payments industry.\nAfter its initial establishment in late 2015, Bitnovo quickly cemented itself as a dominant company within Spain’s bitcoin industry. Within 6 months the company had released prepaid bitcoin debit cards that can be used to make withdrawals from any Mastercard ATM around the world, and had announced plans for their expansion into the international bitcoin markets.\nMany Are Speculating That Instability Within Spanish Financial Markets Is Driving Sustained Growth in Bitcoin Adoption\n\nThe addition of 4000 bitnovo locations illustrates a growing demand and increasing normalization of bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology in Spain.\nSpain was among the first nations to explore the idea of national cryptocurrencies, launching Spaincoin in 2014 shortly after the Icelandic rollout of Auroracoin. Although the project appears to have been dormant for several years now, Spaincoin saw Spanish officials become one of the first states to promote and encourage cryptocurrency adoption – likely having positive ramifications for the development of the local bitcoin economy.\nIn the recent week several major Spanish banks, law firms, and corporations have announced the formulation of a blockchain consortium that will explore applications for blockchain technology in multiple sectors of Spain’s economy. 2017 also saw the launch of Holytransaction Trade – a cryptocurrency wallet provider that facilitates bitcoin to Euro transactions at any Spanish ATM.\nMany are speculating that instability within Spanish financial markets is driving sustained growth in bitcoin adoption. The recent bank bailout of Banco Popular saw the institution purchased by Santander for just 1 euro – suggesting that Spain’s banking sector still has not recovered from the 2008 global financial crisis.\nDo you think that Spain’s bitcoin markets can provide adequate demand to warrant 4000 new Bitnovo locations?

    "text": "\n This week the price of bitcoin has been descending downwards following a bearish trendline and is currently hovering just around the US$2000 range. The price started its downtrend on July 10 after staying around the $2550 territory for a few days, but subsequently started dropping to a low of $2225 on July 14. At press time the price of BTC is struggling to stay above $2K, and current technical indicators are showing the bear run may not be over.\nAlso read: August 1 and the Potential Disruption of the Bitcoin Network\nFear Uncertainty and Doubt Plagues Cryptocurrency Markets \nIt’s been a pretty grueling week if you’ve been watching cryptocurrency markets, as bitcoin and various altcoins have drastically corrected in value. On July 14 bitcoin’s price formed some new lows dipping to the $2225 range forming a downwards triangular pattern. Over the course of the day and into the overnight the price per BTC continued to slide until finally subsiding to just above the $2K mark. The decentralized currency’s total market capitalization is now only $33 billion, but due to the significant drop in altcoin markets, BTC dominance is up to 46 percent. Bitcoin trade volume is seeing mediocre activity compared to weeks prior at roughly $1 billion USD worth of trading per day.\nBTC/USD July 15, 2017, 9:30 am EDT.\nBTC/USD Technical Indicators \nTechnical indicators show that traders have allowed bears to reign over the market and the ball is in their court now. At press time the long term 200 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is well above the 100 SMA, pointing to continued market losses. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped pretty low since July 12 indicating the beginning of the seller’s market takeover. Further stochastic indicators are also signaling bearish conditions and those shorting the market may be able to set some downside targets. However, at the time of writing, there is a significant foundation at the $1950-2K range and the price may hover in this vicinity for a few more hours.\nBitstamp BTC/USD prices July 15, 2017, 9:30 am EDT.\nMarket Sentiment: Upcoming Protocol Changes Has Likely Created Weak Hands  \nThe bearish market sentiment is likely due to the protocol changes planned for the end of the month. There have been many discussions on the various scenarios where the bitcoin blockchain could split on August 1. Many bitcoiners are patiently waiting to see if the storm passes, but no one knows exactly how things will play out between UASF, UAHF, and Segwit2x. Some bitcoin proponents are fairly positive that Segwit will be implemented soon and the August 1 scenarios may not happen. Other bitcoin enthusiasts are waiting for the next Segwit2x release that is expected to come out this weekend, according to Jeff Garzik. When this happens, the vast majority of miners signaling support for Segwit2x will actually start running the code.\nThe uncertainty tied to the bitcoin ecosystem is likely affecting altcoins markets as well. Just like Crypto Compare’s Charles Hayter told us last week, “a rising tide lifts all boats, but the opposite is also true.”\nWaiting on the Sidelines for the Perfect Entry Point \nOverall bitcoiners are either not happy about the price drop or enthusiastically detailing they are buying the dip. It’s safe to assume as the next two weeks get closer, there will be some volatile action for intra-range players to profit off scalps and breaks. Some traders are speculating that Segwit will be activated soon and the price will reverse back up the ladder. Other traders are envisioning a continued drop to the $1800 territory and a possible following rise after that low price point. One thing is for sure is that traders are uncertain right now and the bulls have stepped off to the sidelines for a lower price entry.\nBear Scenario: If bitcoin breaks the key resistance range below $2K we will see lower trajectories towards the $1800-1900s. At press time according to order books and depth readings, there is a solid foundation within the $1800-2000 territory that should certainly last for the next few days. These critical zones, however, can cause quite a bit of fear and uncertainty which can always spark the possibility of more intensified panic selling.\nBull Scenario: If buy pressure picks up after consolidating above the $2K range we could see some nice recovery over the next 24-hours. Sell walls are pretty flat at the moment, and the price could break higher with ease if bullish traders decide to jump back in the game. However, it seems most buyers are waiting for a lower price trajectory and are assuming this will happen with the current looming possibility of a chain split. Another bullish theory that could take place is; Segwit gets activated within the next two weeks, and the price climbs upwards following this event.\nWhere do you see the price of bitcoin going from here?

    "text": "\n No need to beat yourself up if your cryptocurrency portfolio exhibited less than stellar performance in May. Even the professional traders employed by the big hedge funds active in the space have suffered double digit declines during the previous month. \nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: From New York to Historic Istanbul Market\nCrypto Hedge Funds Show Weak Performance in May\nData provided by three different industry trackers reveals that crypto hedge funds achieved considerable negative growth in the bear market of May 2018.\nThe Eurekahedge Crypto-Currency Hedge Fund Index estimates the losses made by crypto funds to have been 11.66% during May, and 2018’s year to date (YTD) performance to be -22.71%. Market analysis firm, Hedge Fund Research Inc. (HFR), estimates crypto funds to have suffered a decline of 15.48% during May, bringing the YTD performance to -33.3% per the company’s HFR Blockchain Index. And the Cryptocurrency Traders Index of hedge fund data specialist Barclay Hedge shows that the performance of those it is tracking dropped by 19.09% in May, and down 34.57% YTD. The differences between the three benchmarks are due to each following a different number of funds.\nThe weak May figures are in sharp contrast to the strong rebound performance seen the previous month, as Eurekahedge reported an increase of in 52.83% and Barclay Hedge a similar 44.86% in April 2018.\nBarclay Cryptocurrency Traders Index May 2018\nReasons to Remain Positive in the Long Term\nDespite the setbacks in May and high volatility from month to month analysts believe there are reasons to remain optimistic such as the recent SEC statement and new institutional money coming in. “I expect the crypto markets to remain volatile for the foreseeable future,” said Henri Arslanian, cryptocurrency lead for Asia at PwC. “Whilst retail investors may see volatility in the crypto markets as a downside, many crypto funds see it as an opportunity.” He added that the “long term positive impact of the number of institutional players entering” is more important than short-term price changes.\nAnd interest among Asian investors is surging, according to Josh Gu, director of quantitative research at the HFR index division. “Cryptocurrencies have been very volatile, the topic is still hot in China and Japan.” He explained to the FT that cryptocurrencies appealed to individual investors with a large risk appetite. “However, the [Chinese] regulator has banned some of the crypto trading platforms because of risk, so some investors might have panicked.”\n\nIs such a performance justifies paying for portfolio management?

This follows market leaders such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter either severely restricting crypto ads or banning them altogether. \nAlso read: Ethereum Futures in US One Step Closer as CME Deal is Struck\nMicrosoft’s Bing Search Engine Bans Crypto Ads\nAdvertiser Policy Manager, Melissa Alsoszatai-Petheo, posted an update to Microsoft’s Bing search engine ad policy. Bing Ads to Disallow Cryptocurrency Advertising is the title of the company’s rather obvious move. “We are always evaluating our policies to ensure a safe and engaging experience for our Bing users and the digital advertising ecosystem,” Ms. Alsoszatai-Petheo began. “Because cryptocurrency and related products are not regulated, we have found them to present a possible elevated risk to our users with the potential for bad actors to participate in predatory behaviors, or otherwise scam consumers.”\n\nBing has consistently ranked a very distant second behind the Google juggernaut, which gobbles up better than 60% of search traffic on the internet. Google at the beginning of 2018 announced a far more specific series of cryptocurrency related prohibitions, down to defining contract for difference (CFDs) products. \nIt wasn’t too much later when Facebook followed, as we reported at the end of January, with “a new ruling issued on January 30, ‘ads must not promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices, such as binary options, initial coin offerings, or cryptocurrency.’” Twitter too, a mere two months later, presented its new advertising policy, severely restricting initial coin offering (ICOs) and token sales.\n\nProtection is the Pretext\n“To help protect our users from this risk,” the notice from Bing continued, “we have made the decision to disallow advertising for cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency related products, and un-regulated binary options. Bing Ads will implement this change to our financial product and services policy globally in June, with enforcement rolling out in late June to early July.”\nOther than seeking a press cycle of promotion, it does appear “scams” were a bit of a problem during 2017, according to Bing’s annual report. “Tech scams are widely used by bad actors and we rejected 25 million ads in this category in 2017,” they insisted. And under the banner of misleading ads, Bing noted how last “year, we took down 30 million such ads, 20,000 such websites and 43,500 bad actors.”\nDo you think crypto ad bans will have a negative impact?

    "text": "\n According to Le Monde, France’s State Council of taxation has announced a severe lowering of financial penalties on gains from cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. The agency is signaling crypto tax will plummet from its current 45% to an across the board flat 19%. It’s a dramatic change in orientation from the government. Could it be France is ready for a decentralized, digital financial future?\nAlso read: Telegram Urges Paper Airplane Protest, Pussy Riot Activist Arrested\nFrance Lowers Crypto Tax\nIt has been an active year so far for La République. Bruno Le Maire, Minister of Finance, argued a month ago how, “A revolution is underway, of which bitcoin was only the precursor. The blockchain will offer new opportunities to our startups, for example with the Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) that will allow them to raise funds through ‘tokens,’ crypto-actives or not. It promises to create a network of trust without intermediaries, to offer increased traceability of transactions and, overall, to make the economy more efficient,” setting off a wave of enthusiasm from bitcoiners.\nMr. Macron with a Ledger Blue\nFor at least four years, however, the Republic of France has kept taxation on bitcoin core and cryptocurrency capital gains in general at nearly half. There appears to be a softening in this regard, as regulators responded to pushback by enthusiasts, and have pledged to bottom the current rate, 45%, by more than half, to 19%.\nGood news started, perhaps, back in early 2017 after France elected the very young Emmanuel Macron, then 39. While the ecosystem has no political affiliation or loyalty, Mr. Macron gave an encouraging sign by allowing himself to be photographed with a cold storage wallet. It would later be revealed as a publicity stunt prior to his run. But, nevertheless, he at least seemed familiar with the technology. \nAn Active First Quarter\nAgain, during the first quarter of this year France has expended more political calories on the issue of crypto. Beginning with an appointment of an industry “Mission Leader,” France was particularly vocal about carrying forth some kind of world consensus on laws governing crypto (to no avail) ahead of the G20 meeting in Argentina. Shortly after, French minders cracked down upon crypto derivatives, and would a month later publish warnings about 15 “unauthorized” exchanges and platforms.\n\nAround the same time as comments from the Minister of Finance and various regulatory activity, local bitcoiners took their case to the High Administrative Court. The court then ordered cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin be reclassified as property, thus leaving room for lower taxation. Profits derived from mining, however, are to remain under the banner of capital gains, as they’re considered purely commercial activities.\nDo you think this will start a trend among EU countries?

    "text": "\n A crypto mining company has sent a balloon into the stratosphere to mine bitcoin on the edge of space, reaching over 35,000 meters in altitude. The company also shared the results of its survey on what the price of bitcoin would be this year.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space\nSpace Launch PR Stunt\nMiner One launched a “high-altitude balloon with bitcoin mining equipment” on Monday which it calls “Space Miner One (SMO).” The organization describes itself as neither a pool nor a cloud, but “a community of people who want to mine cryptocurrency profitability.” The group is “so bullish on bitcoin” that it hopes this PR stunt will be seen as “a symbol that [the price of] bitcoin will go to 35,000 and beyond.”\n\nThe large latex balloon filled with helium has a parachute attached. It carries ASIC mining equipment, including two ASIC USB Block Erupters, connected to “a Raspberry Pi 3 microcomputer, a battery, and a satellite phone” which “are all placed inside the carbon fibre SMO capsule … along with a souvenir metal ‘bitcoin’ for one lucky winner of the Miner One Sweepstakes,” the group detailed.\nIt also carries “navigation and tracking equipment with an independent power supply, thermoinsulation and a thermoregulator protecting it from temperature extremes,” Miner One explained and described the launch sequence as:\n\nSpace Miner One passes through the troposphere; the ASIC is activated and linked via satellite transmitter to the Internet…As Space Miner One enters the stratosphere, falling air pressure causes the balloon to expand from 2.2 m to 10+ m in diameter – large enough to be seen from the ground.\n\nPrior to descending, “The Balloon is detonated, the parachute deployed, and Space Miner One begins its journey back to Earth,” the group explained, adding that the duration of the trip was roughly 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n“After rising to more than 35,000 metres [~21.75 miles] while mining bitcoin, Space Miner One descends back to Earth and is successfully recovered in an open field in Lithuania,” the group posted on its Facebook page.\nSpace Miner One in the Stratosphere\nAs Space X and other spaceflight companies bring down the price of launching commercial satellites into space, the prospect of mining bitcoin from above the atmosphere grows more appealing to venture capitalists and mining companies.\nSpace X’s Falcon 9 project.\nThe abundant solar energy and freezing temperatures in space both offer major benefits to the mining process that may become commonly used one day. The third benefit of space mining, as Bitcoin developer Peter Todd pointed out in August of last year, is that it may be the only economically relevant way to use energy generated in orbit. It is “a lot cheaper to beam solar power collected in space back to Earth in the form of blocks than as electricity,” he claimed.\nWhile Space Miner One’s mission did not include any solar panels, it could take advantage of the low temperatures in the stratosphere and communicate with the ground using the satellite phone during the mining process. Given the 2.5-hour mission time and the Block Erupter mining hashrate of only 330 Mh/s, Space Miner One was unlikely to have generated a whole satoshi. However, the mission could still be seen as a proof of concept for mining bitcoins in space.\nBullish on Bitcoin\nThe CEO of Miner One, Pranas Slusnys, elaborated:\n\nWe are bullish on bitcoin because it remains the world’s most popular and proven application of blockchain technology. And we see growing interest and adoption, despite recent market doldrums.\n\nThe company has also conducted a survey of more than 1,500 community members. “More than 31% believe bitcoin will go higher than $15,000 this year, 26% say higher than $25,000, and 10% – higher than $35,000,” Miner One shared.\nWhat do you think of Miner One’s PR stunt and the concept of bitcoin mining in space?

London Block Exchange claims to be the only UK crypto platform currently offering GBP pairing with BCH and ETC. It also provides its clients with on-shore banking services and access to the Faster Payments system.\nThe multi-coin exchange dedicated to the UK market now lists six cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC). Its management has promised to regularly add new cryptos. The decision to introduce Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic comes weeks after the centralized Ripple (XRP) was added.\n“We are excited to announce that we have an addition to our blossoming selection of cryptocurrencies. Our customers will now be able to buy, sell, send, and receive Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH),” the company said in a post on its website. According to the press release, the cryptocurrencies will be tradable with the following pairs: BCH-GBP, BCH-BTC, ETC-GBP, and ETC-BTC.\n“As we open our doors to UK crypto enthusiasts, we’re listening and acting on what the community wants – and that’s an array of good quality coin options to trade, all backed by a reliable, comprehensive and user-friendly service that they can trust,” LBX founder and CEO Benjamin Dives stated.\nLBX Offers On-Shore Accounts for Its Clients\nLBX is based in London’s Canary Wharf commercial district.

The platform also introduced on-shore accounts for its clients.\nThe price of Bitcoin Cash has spiked in recent weeks amidst strong demand for BCH. Its market value is currently hovering around $1,300 per coin. The surge was accompanied by more positive news. Revolut, a European startup offering alternative banking services, has recently announced it will be adding support for Bitcoin Cash, as news.Bitcoin.com reported. Meanwhile, an increasing number of businesses have started accepting Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\nA recently conducted poll detected growing awareness about cryptocurrencies among British people. More than 90 percent of the interviewed said they had heard of bitcoin. The survey also found that many Britons, a third of the respondents, would be more likely to invest in cryptos if they were regulated. At the same time, 60 percent said they would not support a state-controlled cryptocurrency issued by the Bank of England.\nUK-based professional investors are even more bullish. A poll among 150 financial services professionals and retail investors found that 54 percent of them expect the prices of cryptocurrencies to rise this year. More than half of the surveyed declared intentions to acquire more digital money and a third said they would retain their crypto holdings or sell only a part of them.\nDo you think cryptocurrency trade will develop in Britain, whose capital city is a global center for traditional finances?

    "text": "\n With the increasing popularity of bitcoin and the like, this year’s tax campaign in Europe comes with many questions on how to report and pay crypto taxes. Despite the obvious hesitation on the part of many governments to comprehensively regulate/legalize the sector, cryptocurrency incomes and profits “enjoy” special attention. Different decisions on the matter pose different challenges to citizens of individual member-states. \nAlso read: Excessive Crypto Regulation Not Optimal, EU Banking Authority Says\nDifferent Approaches\nThere is no uniform approach towards cryptocurrencies in any region and Europe is no exception when it comes to taxation. The recently held G20 summit proves no global consensus on the status of cryptocurrencies, and each jurisdiction is expected to take its own decisions in the short run. In the absence of pan-European guidelines on how to treat crypto-related incomes and profits, some member-states follow a decision by the Court of Justice of the EU. In a 2015 ruling on the application of value added tax (VAT) to cryptocurrencies, the Luxembourg-based institution set a precedent. It basically drew a parallel between “virtual currencies” and fiat money, when digital coins are used for payments.\nIn accordance with that decision, Germany’s Federal Ministry of Finance recently announced that bitcoin should not be subject to VAT, when exchanged with fiat. The tax is applicable only when goods and services are paid for in cryptocurrency. According to German authorities, exchanges can enjoy tax breaks when they trade cryptos, and crypto mining should not be taxed. Trading cryptocurrencies by individuals, however, is subject to standard capital gains tax. Profits of less than €600 and gains from long term holdings (over one year) are exempted.\nSeveral other governments have adopted similar rules. Estonia subjected digital currencies to capital gains tax and VAT. Authorities in Tallinn view cryptos as both means of payment and investments. Slovenia does not tax capital gains of individual investors trading cryptocurrencies, as they are not considered part of their income. Crypto incomes, however, for both individuals and businesses, should be reported and taxed. Applicable rates depend on the annual income and vary from 16% for less than €8,000 to 50% for incomes over €70,000 a year.\nTax authorities in Denmark have announced that crypto companies will be taxed as any other business. According to the Financial Services Authority, private individuals trading cryptocurrencies will not be required to pay taxes. The agency called for adopting legislation that regulates cryptos and their taxation. Spain is mulling tax breaks for businesses using blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies. The exact scope of the exemptions is yet to be determined, but the ruling People’s Party has introduced a bill to offer incentives for small companies in the crypto sector.\nWaiting for Brussels’ Decision\nA number of EU countries are still waiting for a common, European approach towards cryptocurrency taxation. The government in Belgium, which is home to many EU institutions, has not issued an official stance on the matter. Nevertheless, recent reports suggest that tax authorities are going after Belgian citizens trading cryptocurrencies on foreign exchanges. Anyone speculating on crypto markets is expected to pay 33% tax on their gains, despite the fact that cryptocurrencies are not regulated. Belgians should declare them as “other income” on their tax returns, the Special Tax Inspectorate said at the end of last year.\nBulgaria is another member-state expecting guidance from Brussels. The National Revenue Service has issued a clarification notice saying 10% capital gains tax is applicable to profits from buying and selling cryptocurrencies. Their legal status, however, is yet to be determined by the Bulgarian parliament. It remains unclear how bitcoin incomes and purchases with cryptocurrency will be taxed.\nOther EU member-states are losing patience. Dutch finance minister recently described the current regulatory framework as “insufficiently equipped”, as news.Bitcoin.com reported. Wopke Hoekstra spoke of the “inherently cross-border” nature of cryptocurrencies and called for “coordinated international approach”. The government in the Netherlands insists on adopting new European regulations by the end of next year, including amendments to the anti-money laundering directive, which also deals with tax evasion.\nThe European Neighborhood\nWhile EU regulators are still struggling to grasp the crypto phenomenon, other countries in Europe have taken advantage of their non-aligned status. Belarus, for example, is fighting political and economic isolation by embracing crypto. A decree, signed by President Lukashenko, introduces tax breaks and other incentives for crypto-related activities until 2023. It enters into force in less than a week, on March 28. Whether this crypto-friendly policy will fill government coffers at the end of the day remains to be seen.\nHow are crypto incomes and profits taxed in your country?

    "text": "\n The Court of Amsterdam has found that bitcoin possesses “properties of wealth” following a civil rights case. Dutch repossession laws have been invoked to mandate the repayment of 0.591 BTC obliged by a contract between two individuals relating to bitcoin mining.\nAlso Read:The Race Between Segwit and Bitcoin Cash Is Heating Up \nDutch Court Publishing Findings Regarding Bitcoin Mining Contract\nEarlier this week, the Court of Amsterdam published its findings in relation to a civil rights dispute between an individual and a private mining company.\nThe civil rights case was filed by Mr. JW de Vries on February 14 against Koinz Trading BV, with the court ruling in favor of the petitioner – who was owed 0.591 BTC by the company. Significantly, the Court of Amsterdam found that bitcoin possesses “properties of wealth”, determining that the claim of a bitcoin transfer under Dutch property rights is juridically valid.\nThe court judgment states “Bitcoin exists, according to the court, from a unique, digitally encrypted series of numbers and letters stored on the hard drive of the right-holder’s computer. Bitcoin is ‘delivered’ by sending bitcoins from one wallet to another wallet. Bitcoins are stand-alone value files, which are delivered directly to the payee by the payer in the event of a payment. It follows that a bitcoin represents a value and is transferable. In the court’s view, it thus shows characteristics of a property right. A claim for payment in Bitcoin is, therefore, to be regarded as a claim that qualifies for verification.”\nHolland Sets Precedent for Legal Recognition of Bitcoin Contracts\nThe court’s decision is significant as it sets a precedent for the recognition of contractual agreements denominated in bitcoin in future, with the Court of Amsterdam concluding that “It is undisputed that it is clear that the claim that the applicant has seized has not been paid by the plaintiff.”\nThe court also took Holland’s Bankruptcy Act into consideration in making its determinations. “At the hearing, the applicant demonstrated the existence of several (aid) claims. From the documents submitted by the applicant, it appears that several persons have claims on the vested party that see the payment of Bitcoin or on claims for non-fulfillment of obligations under an agreement, with penalties attached in some cases. At the hearing, therefore, it appeared briefly that the applicant had a right of action, as well as facts and circumstances, which show that the applicant is in the position of having ceased to pay.”\nDo you think that the Court of Amsterdam’s ruling will set a precedent for future cases?

    "text": "\n Russia’s Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications has put forward the idea to set up a cryptocurrency exchange, where Russian miners can trade their digital coins for fiat money. The ministry has held consultations with representatives of the crypto sector and prepared a comprehensive concept to regulate the mining industry.\nAlso read: Two Russian Regions to Develop Large Scale Crypto Mining\nMiners to Sell Cryptos on State-Controlled Exchange\nThe crypto mining sector would become more transparent and authorities would be able to easily tax transactions if miners exchanged their cryptocurrency on a Russian, government-controlled exchange. With that argument in mind, the Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications in Moscow has proposed the creation of a crypto exchange to serve Russian miners. The idea was announced during the “Crypto Environment” conference, sponsored by Vnesheconombank, Russia’s development bank.\nMincomsvyaz has also hosted consultations with representatives of the crypto community and has framed a comprehensive concept to regulate the mining industry, Deputy Minister of Communications Alexei Kozyrev told RBC. Its main provisions have been included in the updated version of the bill “On Digital Financial Assets”, authored by the Finance Ministry.\n\nAccording to Kozyrev, the new draft law will differentiate between industrial mining and small-scale, private mining. Big crypto miners will be obliged to meet certain technical requirements, he said, without elaborating on the details. The bill that is expected to regulate Russia’s crypto sector will be introduced in the State Duma within days, Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev announced on Wednesday.\n“We believe they [the miners] should be doing that [exchanging cryptos] on Russian territory”, said Olga Skorobogatova, Deputy President of the Central Bank. Russia’s monetary financial institution believes that cryptocurrency operations bear the inherent risk of money laundering, as it is impossible to trace the circulation of coins all the way back to their creation.\nCrusade to Legalize Cryptocurrencies\nThe Ministry of Finance has expressed exactly the opposite opinion. Its draft law entitles ordinary Russian citizens to buy and sell cryptos and tokens on any licensed platform – exchanges, brokers, forex-dealers, and so on. Minfin is actually on a collision course with the telecom department, as well. Deputy Minister Moiseev thinks that setting up a separate crypto exchange for miners, operating under a special regime, is inappropriate. He reminded his colleagues that the law “On Digital Financial Assets” already provides for the regulation of cryptocurrency trading.\n“We have a licensing regime – Moscow Exchange and Saint Petersburg Exchange are licensed by the Central Bank. There shouldn’t be any specialized exchanges or special regimes for cryptocurrency trading”, Moiseev said, quoted by Tass. “We offer the opportunity to trade cryptos with other cryptos, and with fiat on any exchange”, the Finance Ministry official stated.\nMinfin’s crusade to legalize cryptocurrencies in Russia, against almost everyone else, has caught the attention of Russia’s executive power. The Council of Ministers will discuss disagreements between the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. “These disagreements remain, and the government will have to decide”, Moiseev said, quoted by Insider Pro. At the end of the day, “nobody will be jailed for mining or trading bitcoin”, the Russian official assured.\nAnd while government institutions are bickering about future crypto regulations, the first store for mining equipment has just opened doors in Moscow.\nDo you think Russian miners need a state-controlled exchange to trade their cryptos?

    "text": "\n While European institutions are issuing another series of warnings about the risks and sins of dealing with bitcoin, crypto communities on the Old Continent are trying to preserve freedoms not granted by Brussels. Two exchanges from opposite corners of New Europe have announced plans to offer peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading. Latvia-based Hodlhodl has launched its new P2P platform in beta-mode, and Bulgarian Crypto.bg is developing its own service that may replace the fiat medium with a token.  \nAlso read: Global P2P Crypto Markets Experience Record Volume Throughout December\nGoing Global\nIntensive work to develop decentralized and unregulated crypto markets has been going on in the EU periphery, where memories of excessive regulation and centralization, political and economic, are still vivid. Two exchanges from both ends of (New) Europe have announced preparations to offer full-fledged P2P services to their users, with global aspirations in mind, as well.\nLatvian exchange Hodlhodl has just launched a beta-version of its new platform designed to accommodate safe and secure peer-to-peer transactions of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Users can now open accounts, fill out their profiles, set up two-factor authentication, create offers and study available functionalities. Contracts are currently disabled but developers hope to complete the order book and launch them within a week, the company shared in a blog post.\n\nIn the first stage of the project only bitcoin (BTC) and litecoin (LTC) will be traded. The exchange will operate in beta-mode until July 2018 with 0% commission. A fee of max 0.6% per trade will be applied after that. “The P2P Bitcoin exchange that doesn’t hold funds” will introduce multisig (P2SH) contracts that will allow users to control their funds in escrow. Hodlhodl offers support of native Bech32 Segwit addresses and P2SH-P2WSH Segwit multisig escrow addresses. The exchange services will be decentralized and no KYC (Know Your Customer) or AML (Anti-Money Laundering) procedures will be applied. Passing an “absolutely voluntary verification”, however, will lower commissions to 0.5%.\nPlans for the future include introducing support for Lightning Network micropayments and other cryptocurrencies. The website menus are now available in English and Russian, but other languages will be added. Hodlhodl will be working on optimizing transaction fees and increasing security for its users, while offering integration with wallet providers and a mobile version of the platform. Its team promises a “truly global” P2P cryptocurrency exchange.\nEvery Action Has a Reaction\nIn the opposite corner of Europe, in Bulgaria, a leading crypto trader has also announced that it is working on a P2P platform, after facing multiple issues with the traditional financial system. Crypto.bg was affected by a sudden crackdown last year when Bulgarian banks blocked access to accounts used by local exchanges. It ceased operations in early December, and then restarted trading before going offline again around Christmas. In January, Crypto.bg announced it was forced to suspend trade “indefinitely”.\nThis month the exchange posted on its website that it was exploring options to offer services without going through a bank. Now it is planning to trade Bitcoin on a new peer-to-peer platform that is currently under development. A new medium of exchange will be used instead of fiat currency – CryptoLev (Lev is the Euro pegged BGN). It will probably be an ERC20 token based on the Ethereum blockchain, founder and CEO Stamen Gorchev revealed in the company’s forum. He also mentioned Ethereum Classic as a cheaper alternative.\n\nThe new system will offer the opportunity to trade through Cryptolevs backed by a certain amount of bitcoin “locked” in a public address. A foundation modelled on the Ethereum Foundation in Switzerland may provide further guarantees in the future. Other Bulgarian exchanges have been invited to join the project. Xchange.bg, Altcoins.bg, and Cix.bg have also reported interruptions in their activities quoting various reasons including changing bank accounts.\nBank transfers will be made on a peer-to-peer basis and banks will not be able to tell if such transactions are bitcoin-related. Traders will actually be buying and selling Cryptolevs, used to purchase bitcoins. In addition to locally available services, payment options like Paypal and Skrill may also be added in the future, potentially opening the platform to global markets.\nRelentless Euro Warnings\nWhile both exchanges are working on their P2P platforms, European institutions have issued new warnings about bitcoin. Up to $5.5 billion of criminal money is being laundered in Europe using cryptocurrency, according to Europol. “It’s growing quite quickly and we’re quite concerned,” the agency’s director Rob Wainwright told the BBC. “The police cannot monitor those transactions. And if they do identify them as criminal, they have no way to freeze the assets unlike in the regular banking system”, Wainwright said.\nThis week, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) alerted European investors about the perils of obtaining cryptocurrencies in the absence of legal mechanisms of protection. The regulator charged with “safeguarding the stability of the European Union’s financial system” shared its concerns over the growing number of citizens buying cryptos while ignoring the risks. Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for the financial stability, financial services and the capital markets union, has expressed support for ESMA’s warning.\nDo you think that peer-to-peer platforms will dominate cryptocurrency trade in the near future?

    "text": "\n A South Korean court has ruled that bitcoin has an economic value for the first time. This overturned an earlier court ruling which did not recognize the digital currency. The case involves the confiscation of 191 bitcoins.\nAlso read: Japan’s DMM Bitcoin Exchange Opens for Business With 7 Cryptocurrencies\nBitcoin’s Status Re-Examined\nThe Suwon District Court in South Korea has, for the first time, recognized that bitcoin has an economic value and can be confiscated, local media reported on Tuesday.\nThe ruling concerns the case involving Ahn who was arrested in May of last year and convicted of operating an illegal pornography site with approximately 1.2 million members. Ahn pocketed 1.9 billion won (~USD$1.78 million) in membership fees. While arresting him, the Southern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency confiscated his 216 bitcoins from an online wallet which received some fees from the site.\nIn September of last year, the court did not recognize bitcoin and ruled that it could not be confiscated, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported. An official from the court explained that they did not judge bitcoin to have any economic value because it is “in the form of electronic files without physical entities, unlike cash.”\nLandmark Court Ruling on Bitcoin\nFollowing the first ruling, the prosecutor appealed in December to the court for the ability to confiscate bitcoins. The second hearing was held recently.\nIn the second hearing, the court found that “The crime profit concealment law does not restrict the criminal income to the goods but the cash, the deposit, the stock, and other property with economic value,” Chosun reported and further quoted the court explaining:\n\nBitcoin can be changed into money through an exchange. It can be used as a means of payment through merchants, so it should be regarded as having economic value.\n\nThe court subsequently ruled that “Among the 216 bitcoins confiscated by the prosecution, Ahn’s 191 bitcoins” were traced to email addresses of the pornography site members, so they are “recognized as criminal proceeds from the operation of the site.”\nSince Ahn’s arrest in April, the price of bitcoin has risen significantly. The 191 bitcoins are worth approximately 2.13 billion won (~$2 million) at the time of this writing based on bitcoin’s price on Bithumb, one of the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nMaekyung quoted a lawyer explaining:\n\nThe recognition of virtual currency as an object of forfeiture means that it will be transferred to the national treasury and used as a national budget.\n\nWhat do you think of the new court’s ruling?

The first was the “emergency” regulatory measures, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported. Then a few additional rules followed.\nThe Korean crypto market is dominated by four exchanges; Bithumb, Upbit, Coinone, and Korbit. While Bithumb has long held the number one spot as the country’s largest crypto exchange by volume, newcomer Upbit started reporting higher 24-hour volumes in December. Upbit is backed by Kakao Corporation which owns the country’s most popular chat app, Kakao Talk.\nFollowing the regulators’ announcements, the four exchanges began modifying their terms of service. Among other measures, they are prohibited from offering services to minors and non-Korean residents as well as from issuing new virtual accounts. These accounts were issued by banks for the exchanges to assign to their customers for anonymous KRW deposits and trading.\nMinors and Non-Korean Residents\nUpbit was the first exchange out of the four to post a notice regarding the discontinuation of its services for minors. Those under 19 years old can no longer use Upbit’s services and existing minor customers had until the end of last month to withdraw money from the platform. Its terms of service have been updated, changing from “under 14 years old to under 19 years old,” Upbit detailed.\nA notice was also posted on the Bithumb website, suspending those under 19 years old from subscribing and using its services starting on January 1. The exchange has rephrased the wording in its terms of service from “If you are under 19 years of age, you may be restricted” to “you are restricted.” In addition, virtual accounts will be unavailable for “domestic non-residents.” An official of the exchange previously commented:\n\nThe latest measures won’t have much impact on us as we are already very careful with minors and foreign investors.\n\nCoinone issued a similar notice, stating that trading is limited for “underaged-minors and non-Korean-residents,” clarifying that all of its services will no longer be available to them.\nNo New Virtual Bank Accounts\nBithumb explained on its website that the issuance of new virtual bank accounts has been suspended in accordance with the government’s regulation, which is a “requirement of real name verification for cryptocurrency transactions.”\nCurrently, Shinhan Bank and Nonghyup Bank provide Bithumb with virtual account services. The issuance of new Shinhan Bank virtual accounts was suspended on Friday and the issuance by Nonghyup Bank the following day.\nUpbit also informed its users that “in order to comply with the government’s policy on self-certified accounts, the issuance of virtual accounts for Upbit new subscribers will cease from January 1, 2018.” However, existing members who already have virtual accounts “will be able to make all transactions without change,” the platform noted.\nSimilarly, Coinone wrote, “Virtual account issuing for cryptocurrency trading will be closed temporarily” beginning on December 29, 2017, in order “to apply Korean government’s policy for the real-name system.”\nOn the same day, another major exchange, Korbit, suspended the issuance of new virtual accounts. Citing that Shinhan Bank currently provides the exchange with virtual account services, Korbit noted:\n\nIf you already have a KRW [virtual] deposit account issued by Shinhan Bank, your KRW deposit or withdrawal requests will not be restricted. However, there may be an additional regulatory impact on KRW deposit or withdrawal requests [from the government] in the future.\n\nThe exchange added, “We will continue to work closely with the regulators and banking institutions to prepare a fully-compatible platform that safely processes KRW deposits and withdrawals in accordance with the new regulation.”\nDo you think the changes will have a positive effect on the Korean crypto markets? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "text": "\n Despite being one of the most amazing periods of sustained gains for bitcoin, 2017 ends with the first cryptocurrency losing market share to altcoins. After falling as low as 37.9% in the last two days of 2017, the market dominance of bitcoin now stands at just 38.2% as of this writing on the first day of 2018.\nAlso Read: First Real Bitcoin Lightning Network Payment Completed via Bitrefill\nBTC Dominance Is Declining\nBitcoin’s current total market capitalization is more than $234 billion, an incredible figure by itself but one that falls in comparison to the grand ecosystem it has birthed. The original cryptocurrency is currently comprising approximately less than 40% of the $615 billion cryptocurrency markets. This is only the second time ever that the dominance of BTC has fallen below this low threshold, the first time being in June of 2017.\n\nBitcoin has been gaining ground since its June low recently, reaching over 60% market share by early November. The end of 2017 however brought an onslaught of raising contenders to upset BTC’s dominance. Ripple’s XRP is now worth about $88 billion by itself after a massive rally in December. Ethereum’s market cap follows very closely now at over $74 billion. Bitcoin cash (BCH) is also not too far behind with an overall market value of $43 billion.\n34 Billion Dollar Coins\nContributing to the market share loss of bitcoin, there are now 33 altcoins and ICO tokens that are worth over $1 billion by market cap each. These start with ripple, ether and bitcoin cash, but reach all the way down the list to dogecoin.\nIncredibly, there are now also about 129 altcoins and ICO tokens that are worth between $100 million to $1 billion by market cap each.\nWith a total 1,374 coins now comprising the over $600 billion crypto ecosystem, it should perhaps be no surprise that the long tail of the market is becoming ever fatter today and weighing down its head. Looking at it this way, this development might not be a bad thing for bitcoin but rather a sign of maturity by the market. Unless of course you think most altcoins and ICO tokens are scams anyway.\nDo you think that bitcoin will continue to lose its market dominance to altcoins in 2018?

    "text": "\n While bitcoin and resurgent altcoins were claiming the headlines in December, ICOs were quietly claiming the money. From a media perspective, the summer of 2017 was when ICO mania hit its peak. That’s when several of the largest token sales concluded, raising hundreds of millions of dollars apiece. But from a financial perspective, December will go down as the most lucrative month to date, with over US $1 billion raised from Initial Coin Offerings for the first time.\nAlso read: Convenience Stores and Pawn Shops See Foot Traffic from Bitcoin ATMs\nSmall Sales Are Big Business\nThe definition of what constitutes a “small” token sale is debatable in a space where millions of dollars are raised for startups that don’t even have a development team. It is evident however that mammoth token sales, especially those that are uncapped, are becoming less prevalent. The last ICO to clear $200 million was Filecoin back in September, and the glut of those tokens were snapped up by institutional investors.\nPrior to that, Tezos was the last public sale in which the $200 million mark was troubled. The records made – and subsequent promises broken – by Tezos may be one reason why ICOs maintained a lower profile in Q4 of 2017. Behind the scenes though, it’s been business as usual, with more token sales than ever reaching completion with each passing month. December saw the conclusion of ICOs hosted by Sirin Labs (which raised $158m), Bankex, ($70m), Nebulas ($60m) and Blockstack ($52m).\n\n2018 Looks Set to Be Another Record-Breaker\nDecember was the first month that ICOs raised over $1 billion, finishing the year on a record high of $1.2 billion, with Sirin Labs and Bankex helping nudge the total over that symbolic threshold. According to Tokendata, this meant a total of $5.6 billion was raised from ICOs in 2017, based on 442 completed ICOs, with a median of $4.5 million raised. Tokendata tends to list only the larger ICOs; throw in the less fancied ones listed by the likes of ICO Alert and Tokenreport and that figure is closer to $6 billion.\nJanuary looks like being another bumper month for token sales, thanks to major offerings from the likes of WYS Token, an ecommerce project, and Cryptohawk, an all-in-one cryptocurrency payment solution. The Swiss-based company aims to connect all things crypto, making it easier to exchange cryptocurrencies for offline purchases and providing a payment solution for shop operators. Cryptohawk’s project includes plans for crypto ATMS and credit cards, two financial services that are attracting a lot of attention from ICOs. Lending services also look like faring well in 2018. Salt and Ethlend’s platforms are already live, while decentralized credit scoring system Bloom completed its crowdsale on January 1, raising over $40 million.\nQuality Not Quantity\nFrom an investment perspective, ICOs are evidently still profitable, but the days when “X on the blockchain” or “A decentralized Y” could automatically be expected to raise millions are gone. It has been estimated that two thirds of token sales fall short of their soft cap; one analysis of 400 completed ICOs in 2017 found that 35% reported their fundraising figures. The remainder stayed silent, which is indicative of targets being missed.\n\nIt would be surprising if the median return to investors on tokens this year surpassed that of 2017, when Tokendata calculated there to be an average return of 12.8x. With more investors and investor tools than ever scrutinizing every new token sale, the odds of finding ‘undiscovered gems’ are becoming less likely. Even highly publicized gems are capable of performing robustly once released onto the open market, however. Despite increased scrutiny from regulators, signs point towards 2018 being another bumper year for Initial Coin Offerings.\nWhat ICOs are you looking forward to in 2018? Let us know in the comments section below.

This month Huobi has revealed its carved a deal with the Japanese financial institution SBI Group and will be launching two new cryptocurrency exchanges in Q1 of 2018.\nAlso read: Japan’s GDP Grows Due to Bitcoin Wealth Effect\nThe Company That Operated China’s Largest Bitcoin Exchange Sets Its Sights On Japan \nBefore the beginning of 2017, China’s top three exchanges swapped the most bitcoins worldwide, capturing the lion’s share of globes BTC trades. One of those exchanges was Huobi, a company headquartered in Beijing who held China’s top BTC trade volumes since 2013. However, in January of 2017, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) started cracking down on domestic exchanges facilitating cryptocurrency trades within the country. At first, things just seemed like some harsher regulatory action would take place, but the central bank shut down all of the Chinese exchanges who enabled digital asset trades with the renminbi.\nNow the trading platform’s parent company Huobi Group is partnering with the financial institution SBI formerly known as Softbank Investment Group. The two plan on launching two virtual currency exchanges one with a tentative name “SBI Virtual Currencies,” and the other “Huobi Japan.” \nSBI Believes Huobi Group’s Track Record Is Enough to Fulfill The Basic Agreement \nSBI also reveals the bank plans to use “Huobi’s technology, know-how and human resources” to establish top of the line cryptocurrency-related business in the Asian region. With the partnership and creation of the two new exchanges, SBI Group plans to acquire “30 percent of the equity in Huobi Group’s Japanese entity.” The organization also plans to take 10 percent of Huobi Group’s Korean entity and Huobi, in turn, will receive 30% of the equity in the SBI Virtual Currencies business. SBI explains that Huobi has a solid reputation in the digital currency space which has laid the foundation for the basic agreement: \n\nSBI Holdings has reached a basic agreement with Huobi Group (1.65 million accounts, maximum daily transaction volume of over CNY 30 billion (approximately JPY 510 billion), which has a track record of stably operating a major cryptocurrency exchange in China, to explore the following alliances.\n\nAt the moment Huobi Group also operates a global cryptocurrency exchange called Huobi.pro which sees a lot of volume from regions like Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong. The company also still operates its China News and Research Platform and its Huobi Wallet Digital Asset Management service.

    "text": "\n A mechanism tailored to protect customers of cryptocurrency businesses in Gibraltar, and its own reputation, went into effect on January 1. The regulation targets blockchain technology – companies storing and transmitting value must now be licensed by the Financial Services Commission (GFSC). \nAlso read: Malta Bitcoin Schizophrenia: Government and Banks Send Mixed Signals\nGibraltar – “World’s First”\nThe Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) Regulatory Framework has been introduced after last month the Legislature of Gibraltar approved a bill designed to update its financial services regulations. It laid down the foundation for new legislation governing the cryptocurrency sector in the territory with financial services and online gambling still considered the major pillars of the economy.\n“We are really excited to finally welcome applications from DLT providers. We expect to be very busy in the coming months”, Nicky Gomez, head of GFSC’s Risk and Innovation Department, said, quoted by the International advisor. “We are looking forward to working on some interesting and innovative ideas with applicants”, he added.\nGomez pointed out that GFSC had become the first regulator to introduce a DLT Regulatory Framework in collaboration with the financial services industry and the government of Gibraltar. “It is a very encouraging time and we are looking forward to the challenge”, the official said.\n\nTrue, Unrivaled in Europe\nBeing a British overseas territory, Gibraltar has a legal system that is quite independent from the United Kingdom. That has allowed it to develop its own government policies and economic priorities. Gibraltar has attracted financial companies and online sports betting and gaming businesses in its jurisdiction with corporate tax incentives and relaxed regulations, unrivaled by others in the EU.\nIn December the 17-member local parliament modernized the territory’s financial services legislation with a newly adopted bill. It paved the way for a comprehensive set of rules addressing challenges presented by cryptocurrencies and governing operations of companies in the sector. In doing that, Gibraltar has progressed on fulfilling its intentions to position itself as an attractive location for crypto businesses. They may actually build a brand new pillar to support its economy. And Gibraltarians, in their turn, may completely forget the times when the old British naval dockyard accounted for more than half of their economy.\nFor God, Queen… and Territory\nIn its latest move along these lines Gibraltar has laid out certain principles designed to protect consumers’ rights and interests, as well as its own reputation. All licensees will have to follow them. For example, every DLT provider should communicate with its customers in a way which is fair, clear and not misleading and have proper regard to risks to its business and customers. Companies must also have effective arrangements in place for the protection of client assets and money, including “contingency, disaster recovery and crisis management plans”.\nSo, Gibraltar is obviously taking no chances. A notification on the GFSC’s website clearly states that as from January 1, 2018, any use of distributed ledger technology for storing or transmitting value belonging to others will need to be authorized by the Commission. By the way, the following entries: “Initial Application Assessment Fee”, “Application Fee”, “Supplementary Fees”, “Annual Fees”, “Further Fees”, populate a list tucked in between the “Principles” and the “Frequently Asked Questions” sections.\nWelcome to Gibraltar!

    "text": "\n Russia’s president Vladimir Putin has reportedly commissioned work to create a cryptocurrency as a tool to circumvent international sanctions. His economic adviser explained that “no mining is possible” for the cryptoruble. Meanwhile, the country’s central bank and finance ministry have expressed skepticism about this “cryptocurrency.”\nAlso read: Russian Cryptocurrency Bill Is Ready – Regulators Share Details\nCryptoruble to Help Circumvent Sanctions\nSergey Glazyev.\nPutin is reportedly exploring ways to create a cryptocurrency that can help the country circumvent western sanctions. The Financial Times reported Moscow officials saying that Putin “has commissioned work on establishing a cryptocurrency.” Sergey Glazyev, an economic adviser to Putin, described at a recent government meeting that “a cryptorouble would be a useful tool to get around international sanctions,” the publication added and quoted him saying:\n\nThis instrument [cryptoruble] suits us very well for sensitive activity on behalf of the state. We can settle accounts with our counterparties all over the world with no regard for sanctions.\n\nHe added that this new currency would be “the same rouble, but its circulation would be restricted in a certain way,” thereby allowing the Kremlin to track its every move, the news outlet noted.\nFirst Proposal of Cryptoruble\nNikolay Nikiforov.\nIn October 2017, Putin ordered the creation of Russia’s national cryptocurrency, largely referred to as the cryptoruble, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported.\nThe Minister of Communications and Mass Media, Nikolay Nikiforov, subsequently submitted the first proposal of this new currency a week later. “These are technological proposals,” he said at the time without elaborating on the details.\nIn November, Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev hinted that the proposed cryptoruble may not be an actual cryptocurrency, suggesting that its name should change from cryptoruble to cyber-ruble.\nGlazyev’s Version of Cryptoruble\nLast month Glazyev independently proposed his version of the cryptoruble and suggested using for settlements between the state and corporations. He told Kommersant that the cryptoruble will be issued by the authorities and that “no mining is possible,” adding that:\n\nIt’s just a decision of the authorities to issue a non-cash form of a discrete stream of monetary units… The digital ruble guarantees us full protection – from fraud, from theft…Wherever there is a demand for the targeted use of money, be it government spending, budget investment, the work of banking structures and corporations, it can be applied.\n\nNo Support from Central Bank and Finance Ministry\nWhile Glazyev is a proponent of creating the cryptoruble as soon as possible, the finance ministry and the Bank of Russia are skeptical. Each has stated they do not see a need for the cryptoruble.\nDuring the meeting where the bill for the regulation of cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) in Russia was presented, Moiseev said the ministry of finance is in no hurry to create the cryptoruble. Last week, Interfax quoted him saying:\n\nTo be honest, I do not even understand what a cryptoruble is…I understand what an electronic ruble is. I understand what ‘a Yandex-purse’ is … If you declare that we renounce the constitutional principle that the issue is produced by the central bank, then, of course, we can make a cryptoruble.\n\nOlga Skorobogatova.\nMeanwhile, the central bank’s first deputy governor Olga Skorobogatova said that the bank “does not think this [cryptoruble] is advisable from the point of view of the macroeconomics of the population.”\nHowever, she revealed that the bank is considering “a supranational digital currency within the BRICS or the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEC).” According to her, the Bank of Russia believes that:\n\nThe issue of a common cryptocurrency for a number of countries is very promising, more than that for a single nation.\n\nWhat do you think the final form of the cryptoruble will be? Do you think it will be good for the crypto community? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "text": "\n Intervention by Visa spelled an end to European crypto debit cards for the majority of customers on Thursday. Around a dozen crypto companies were affected by the shutdown, which instantly wiped out their services across Europe. Issuers such as Bitwala, Tenx, Bitpay, and Xapo were left high and dry after a Visa subsidiary stopped processing payments. Two of the companies affected have since spoken to news.Bitcoin.com, revealing their plans to find an alternative solution.\nAlso read: Visa Veto Leaves Several European Cryptocurrency Cards Locked Out\nCrypto Card Holders Are Locked Out\nOn Thursday, news.Bitcoin.com reported on a sudden crackdown on crypto cards within Europe, orchestrated by Visa subsidiary Wavecrest. The report explained how “the prepaid cards, which have become extremely popular in the crypto community, provide a means of indirectly paying for goods and services using cryptocurrency.”\nBridging the gap between fiat and crypto is one of the biggest challenges cryptocurrency platforms face. Hybrid cards, which allow a debit card to be funded with crypto and then used to make purchases in the local fiat currency, were seen as a smart solution. That all changed this week when hundreds of thousands of European crypto-holders found their cards had been rendered useless.\n\nTenx was one of those companies affected by the ban. The company’s co-founder, Dr. Julian Hosp, told news.Bitcoin.com that around 200,000 customers had been impacted, but signaled that a resolution is on the horizon: \n\nTenx was prepared for this, as the company has recently entered partnership  with a new card issuing partner and is in the process of getting the new cards live to replace the old ones as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Tenx customers will be able to withdraw their funds from their accounts as of Monday evening (January 8), while they await developments.\n\nDr Hosp also appeared on a live Hangout on Saturday to explain more about the current situation. The company’s co-founder seems upbeat, telling news.Bitcoin.com of plans to introduce a “live virtual currencies card” and obtain a banking licence for better fiat currency integration.\nThe Hunt for a New Issuer\nWirex is another crypto card firm that finds itself without a payment processing partner after Visa slammed the door. The company claims to be Wavecrest’s largest client, with over one million customers – most of whom don’t use crypto cards, it should be noted. Nevertheless, the effects of the Visa veto were still dramatic: around 600,000 Wirex plastic or virtual card holders were left without service after the ban.\nInterestingly, Wirex CEO Pavel Matveev asserts that Visa are blameless in this, insisting that the blame lies solely with Wavecrest. He told news.Bitcoin.com: “Wavecrest have been violating Visa rules for months…it’s 100% Wavecrest’s fault and they knew it was coming a couple of months ago.”\nLike Tenx, Wirex is confident the situation won’t leave its European customers serviceless. Pavel says they have four alternative issuers to choose from, one of which is based in Europe. “For us,” he said, “it’s a question of switching issuer and re-issuing cards, so it’s just a temporary problem; but for a lot of companies it’s the end of their business – they don’t have an alternative issuer and finding one plus integration might take anyway from 6 to 18 months”.\nWho’s to Blame?\nSome in the cryptocurrency community were swift to point the finger at Visa in the aftermath of the ban, though there is no evidence as yet that the order came from up high. Given that it processes more than 100 billion transactions a year versus bitcoin’s circa 130 million, it’s premature to assert that Visa is feeling threatened by cryptocurrency. Whatever bitcoin is, be it a store of value or a medium of exchange, it is not, as yet, a Visa killer. Nor is Visa, or its subsidiary Wavecrest, a crypto killer.\nIt seems likely that the majority of European card issuers will be able to resume service in the near future. Customers will be wary, though, of putting all their faith in one crypto card, in the knowledge that a repeat of the Wavecrest incident could see service suspended at any time.\nDo you think Visa are culpable, or was this matter none of their doing? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "text": "\n Bitpay is facing a backlash against its decision to implement a controversial feature it says is meant to protect bitcoin users. The leading payment processor is accused of abusing its dominant position to bully wallet providers into supporting its plans, degrading users’ privacy and hurting the use of bitcoin altogether.\nAlso Read:  Cryptocurrency Hedge Fund Headed by Ex-Goldman Sachs VP Raises $140 Million \nBitpay Power Play\nBitpay, the digital asset service provider based in Atlanta, Georgia, is coming under attack for a recent protocol change. As we reported at the time, only a handful of other wallets currently support BIP70 and its implementation is controversial. Meant to prevent main-in-the-middle attacks by using QR codes, critics fear BIP70 introduces legacy public-key infrastructure dependencies and its widespread implementation will create an increased risk of AML/KYC surveillance and monitoring of transactions.\nFounded in May 2011 by Tony Gallippi and Stephen Pair, Bitpay is widely considered to be the largest bitcoin payment processor in the world today. The company is accused of leveraging this power to coerce bitcoin wallet developers to support its position or be left out of reach for many merchants.\nThe developers of the privacy-centric bitcoin wallet, Samourai, commented: “Users should stand up to this kind of arrogance and stand up for their privacy. Samourai has already started the process of contacting all vendors we rely on who utilize BitPay as a payment processor and informing them of our intention to switch vendors, as using Bitpay is no longer tolerable or feasible. We hope others join us.”\nBIP70 Instead of Segwit\nThe move was also criticized by bitcoin core developers for adopting BIP70 over segwit. The company didn’t need more negative feedback at this time as Bitpay was already under a lot of public pressure over its recent actions like limiting BTC transaction to $100 minimum and quickly backtracking and stopping all non-US credit cards.\nThe Samourai team added: “We absolutely do not support Bitpay in agressively using their dominant position of market share to bully wallet providers into supporting their business plans or bully users into a system that degrades their privacy and the fungibility of bitcoin as a whole. Bitpay should focus on repairing their image and brand after the cataclysmic failure of the Segwit2x Fork they helped architect, instead of reinforcing their image as an out of touch bully looking to hijack the network for their own gain.”\nIs Bitpay abusing its power or just looking out for its users?

    "text": "\n In recent days a number of conflicting reports have surfaced pertaining to the stance of China’s government with regards to bitcoin mining. Last week, Bloomberg reported that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) had met to discuss curbing mining operations in China, whilst Chinese media reports denied such – however, it has since emerged that the local government of Xinjiang province has mandated an “orderly exit” of its bitcoin mining industry. Despite widespread speculation that the long-feared Chinese crackdown on cryptocurrency mining may have begun, the establishment of international facilities on the part of leading mining pools has led to analysts predicting that much of the bitcoin mining industry will be able to weather a Chinese regulatory crackdown.\nAlso Read: Chinese Authorities Ask Local Miners to Submit Monthly Status Reports\nPBOC to Limit Power Consumption of Bitcoin Mining Industry\nOn the 3rd of January, Bloomberg reported that “people familiar with the matter” had stated that the PBOC will take action to limit the power consumed by bitcoin miners. The source stated that there is growing concern among Chinese officials that the energy-intensive requirements of the large-scale cryptocurrency mines are disrupting the distribution of power as intended by the central government.\nIn November, a document surfaced suggesting that a state-owned power company in Sichuan would seek to crack down on bitcoin mining, however, the company stated that the letter had been misconstrued due to translation errors, and that such pertained to “fail[ure]s” of “small hydropower stations” to “give priority to… the local… electricity demand.” Later that month, news.Bitcoin.com met with the manager of a bitcoin mining farm in Sichuan, whose comments further suggested that local power companies may be operating beyond the directives of the central government.\n“When we first met people at the hydropower station, we told them we were a cloud computing company, but the manager of the hydropower station laughed at us and said ‘Bullshit, I know you people came here to mine bitcoin. Just tell us what can we get’. As to local government, we don’t have to meet with any officials, the station will help coordinate. And who can get the right to set a mining factory? The rule is very simple: first come, first served.”\nChinese State Media Denies Allegations of Mining Crackdown\nState-owned Chinese media immediately sought to dismiss allegations of an imminent crackdown targeting the mining industry. On January 4th, an article published by Caixin claimed that “The Central Bank did not hold an Internal meeting on January 3rd,” and that “since November 2017,” the objective of official policy has been to “encourage” mining operations.\nThe article, however, asserted the Chinese state will “no longer give any mining incentives, including taxes, electricity, land, etc“ – apparently confirming, at the very least, that the central government will seek to tighten control over the distribution of electricity within provinces at a local level.\nXinjiang Province Mandates “Orderly Exit” of Cryptocurrency Miners\nYesterday, news.Bitcoin.com reported on a document written prior to January 5th indicating the desire of Xinjiang Province regulators to expel cryptocurrency miners from its jurisdiction. The document states “To curb financial risks and encourage the real economy, approaches must be taken to guide miners toward an ‘orderly’ exit from the business,” and mandates that mining companies submit status reports before the 5th of each month.\nA separate document originating from the Financial Market of the PBOC states that “Local governments shall coordinate with multiple departments to take actions concerning electricity price, land use, tax and environmental protection in an effort to guide miners orderly exit.” Although the extent to which the policy of Xinjiang Province will be replicated in other jurisdictions, many are speculating that a Chinese mining crackdown may be currently underway.\nLeading Mining Operations Relocate to Establish Operations Overseas\nSome analysts are predicting that the actions of Chinese regulators may have little effect on many heavyweights of the mining industry, as many leading mining companies announced their intention to establish operations internationally, following China’s crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges that was initiated earlier in 2017.\nIn October of last year, reports indicated that Bitmain would be opening a regional headquarters in Singapore, following its establishment of operations in the United States and Canada. Other leading mining companies reported to have set-up operations abroad include the third largest mining pool, Btc.top, expected to establish operations in Canada, and the fourth largest mining pool, Viabtc, which now operates facilities in Iceland and The United States.\nWhat do you think the impact of Chinese crackdown on mining would be?

However, demand for these instruments continues to soar in India. Besides taxation, the regulators have been actively discussing how cryptocurrencies should be regulated but no official decision has been made.\nTaxation of cryptocurrencies has been a recent focus of the Indian government. In December, the tax authority conducted a survey of the country’s top bitcoin exchanges, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported. Notices were then sent to wealthy cryptocurrency traders informing them of their tax obligations. However, no guidelines have been provided and Indians are confused about what their crypto tax obligations are.\nCiting that the “Use of Bitcoin was maximised post demonetisation, when a cashless economy was being promoted,” Chatterjee pointed out in his PIL that several criminal cases in India have shown cryptocurrencies threatening taxation. “Moreover, the value of cryptocurrencies have witnessed upheavals in the absence of controlling authorities,” he was quoted by the Times of India. Chatterjee further elaborated:\n\nIn Bengal, the economic impact of such a decentralised, unregulated and unaccounted parallel economic system is huge.\n\nThe High Court will hear this case on February 2.\nDo you think India will attempt to intervene in the flow of bitcoins soon? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "text": "\n The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly informed two bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) aspirants their cryptocurrency products lack enough liquidity and are problematic in discovering valuation.\nAlso read: Bitcoin Turns 9 Years Old\n\nTwo Firms Withdraw Bitcoin ETF Proposals from SEC\nWall Street’s main regulatory body, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), sent negative signals to bitcoin ETF hopefuls, as the regulator reportedly expressed concerns about the potential of bitcoin futures bundled together as a tradable stock, according to reports.\nThe regulator is gatekeeper to listings on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and has received somewhere near a dozen applications for bitcoin ETFs. Worries about “valuation” and “liquidity” were cited in withdrawal filings, according to reports. Withdrawals came Monday, 8 January 2018, just days after a headline-making ETF product was formally proposed.\nDirexion Asset Management’s asked no fewer than five ETFs be traded on the NYSE Arca, and those funds substantially increase risk exposure. In late December of last year, Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) formally petitioned the regulator too in hopes of having half a dozen ETFs traded on the Bats BZX exchange. \nIndeed with the advent of Cboe futures contract markets being made (along with crosstown rival CME), there was widespread optimism over the SEC policy. The agency wished to ensure viability of a financial product was first in place before going ahead on bitcoin ETFs. That standard seemed to be met by the two Chicago exchanges. By mid December, the agency hired a former ETF advisor to head a critical division in these matters. And by Fall of last year, even Bank of America was predicting giant potential for bitcoin ETFs. All seemed a go.\nSEC vs CFTC\nAnd then, “Trusts controlled by Rafferty Asset Management LLC and Exchange Traded Concepts LLC each canceled plans to launch three bitcoin funds that could be traded by retail investors as easily as stocks,” Reuters announced. \nIf the bitcoin ETF prospects are murky, one thing is crystal clear: US government financial regulators are confusing the very industry they’re designed to facilitate. As noted, bitcoin futures are already being traded in two very established exchanges, and things appear to be going well apart from the relative lack of excitement set against early expectations. Those markets are overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nThe CFTC has been unusually welcoming despite a lot of pressure to reject crypto entrants into the mainstream. They’re even agreeing to testify before Congress at the end of this month to give lawmakers a status report.\nBy contrast, the SEC has dragged the process along for crypto funds. This is at least the third firm to withdraw from their process. Even its former Chair has suggested the agency wants no part of this brave new currency world, describing the SEC as woefully unprepared. \nAs of this writing, neither of the two latest firms to withdraw have publicly commented on the matter, nor has the SEC.\nDo you think the SEC is being too picky?

Trading in the stocks of one such alleged company has now been stopped by the SEC.\nAlso Read: Peak Blockchain Hype? Firm With No Revenues and No Product Is Worth $1.2 Billion\nWait a SEC\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced the temporary suspension of trading in the securities of UBI Blockchain Internet, Ltd. (OTCMKTS: UBIA), of Hong Kong, China on January 8, 2018. Last we reported two weeks ago it was worth about $1.2 billion after its stock jumped in value about 1,000% in 2017.\nThe SEC explains it suspended trading in the securities of UBI because of “(i) questions regarding the accuracy of assertions, since at least September 2017, by UBIA in filings with the Commission regarding the company’s business operations; and (ii) concerns about recent, unusual and unexplained market activity in the company’s Class A common stock since at least November 2017.”\nEverything is Blockchain, Nothing is Blockchain\nUBI claimed in its SEC filings that it is developing a solution based on blockchain technology “to trace a food or drug product from its original source within the context of the Internet of Things to the final consumer.” However, it is not clear at all that the company had any ability to actually try and deliver on this promise.\nPrior to changing its name to to UBI Blockchain Internet in November 2016, the company was supposed to be designing a suite of modular, self-contained, automated, and climate controlled units for distributed production of energy. It also does not have any significant operations and just 18 employees, according to records at Yahoo Finance.\nWhat might have triggered the SEC to act, beyond the negative press coverage, is UBI management’s plans to sell an extra 72.3 million shares owned by its top executives. Could this serve as a sign for other “blockchain” named companies to not try to sell stocks when they are at their peak price based on hype alone?\nWas the SEC right to stop trading on UBI?

The MAS chairman also stated that The Commercial Affairs Department will be empowered to investigate and prosecute cases relating to money laundering or terrorist financing.\nUnique Challenges Posed by Virtual Currencies\nThe MAS chairman, however, recognized that the regulation of virtual currency transactions may pose challenges not associated with monitoring fiat currency circulations.\nMr. Shanmugaratnam emphasized the pseudo-anonymous qualities of cryptocurrency, adding that the absence of a centralized clearing further complicates the challenge of regulating transactions executed using virtual currencies.\nIn order to mitigate said challenges, the MAS will seek to impose anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing requirements on intermediaries that exchange fiat for virtual currencies – such as exchanges and brokers. Singapore’s financial regulator is presently conducting public consultation relating to the proposed Payment Services Bill intended to empower MAS to have greater jurisdiction over cryptocurrency exchanges and brokerages.\nMr. Shanmugaratnam’s comments comprise an apparent change in the position of the MAS with regards to the cryptocurrencies, as the MAS chairman has previously stated that the MAS will not seek to regulate virtual currencies, except for when the activities relating to cryptocurrencies directly fall under the juridical purview of the MAS. By contrast, Mr. Shanmugaratnam’s recent statement illustrates that the MAS is seeking to expand its regulatory mandate to greater monitor businesses that convert fiat into cryptocurrencies.\nDo you think that the MAS will seek a further extension of its mandate in order to regulate and monitor cryptocurrency circulations?

    "text": "\n The South Korean government has announced that cryptocurrency traders will be fined if they do not convert from existing virtual accounts, which allows for anonymous trading, to real-name accounts. Regardless of their service levels to crypto exchanges, banks have been ordered to implement the new system this month as planned.\nAlso read: South Korea Urges 23 Countries, EU, and IMF to Collaborate on Curbing Crypto Trading\nCrypto Traders Facing Fines\nThe South Korean financial authorities said on Sunday that cryptocurrency traders in the country “will be fined for refusing to convert their virtual accounts into real-name ones,” Yonhap reported.\nCurrently, crypto traders are able to trade anonymously by using virtual accounts. However, the authorities have banned banks from issuing new ones and mandated them to install the new system “that ensures only real-name bank accounts and matching accounts at cryptocurrency exchanges to be used for deposits and withdrawals,” the news outlet detailed, adding that:\n\nCryptocurrency traders will be allowed to convert their virtual accounts into real-name ones within this month, but those who refuse to accede to real-name identification will face fines.\n\n“People who have traded virtual currency have been told that if they refuse to check their real name, they will be penalized for depositing into an existing account,” the Kyunghyang Shinmun elaborated. Only withdrawals will be allowed from existing virtual accounts.\nSouth Korea first enforced the Real Name Financial Transaction System on August 3, 1993, forcing all financial transactions to be conducted under real names.\nUntil that time, financial transactions of large amounts between private parties were often conducted under false names or pseudonyms. In 2014, this law was revised and penalties of imprisonment of up to five years or a fine of 50 million won (~USD$47,000) were introduced.\nWhile the amount of the fine has not been determined for violations by cryptocurrency traders, Yonhap pointed out that “In 1993, violators of the country’s real-name financial transaction system were slapped with fines amounting to 60 percent of their financial assets.”\nFurthermore, Chosun quoted a government official saying, “Currently, we are establishing a taxation plan for virtual currency transactions centered on the accounting department. If a virtual currency real name verification system is introduced, we will be able to obtain data on individual traders.”\nBanks Must Install the New System Regardless\nThe financial authorities started inspecting 6 major Korean banks at the beginning of last week for their anti-money laundering compliance related to virtual account services. The inspection was supposed to end on January 11 but the authorities decided to extend it to January 16. Following the extension announcement, banks became reluctant to implement the real-name system as mandated by the cryptocurrency regulation.\nShinhan Bank was the first to announce its decision not to implement this new system. The bank immediately sent a letter to each exchange it currently provides virtual account services to, informing them of its decision. Among them was Bithumb, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Following Shinhan’s move, other banks were also reportedly ready to follow suit and delay the implementation of the real-name system.\nHowever, on January 13, the government held a meeting with representatives of the 6 banks and asked them to implement the new real-name system as planned, regardless of whether they decide to service crypto exchanges or not. A financial official was quoted by Hankook-Ilbo:\n\nEven if virtual currency transactions are entirely illegal, the real name verification system needs to be introduced by itself.\n\nFollowing the government’s instruction, banks reportedly agreed to implement the new system as planned.\nWhat do you think of the Korean government imposing fines on cryptocurrency traders?

But as retail and institutional investors seem to be looking for other options, are classic analysts telling the whole story?\nAlso read: Only Sharks Will Feed on the Crypto Market’s Elusive Price Bottom\nThe Pessimist’s Case for Dismissing Bitcoin\nA group of JP Morgan Chase analysts believe the prolonged bear market of 2018 is scaring institutional investors away from Bitcoin.\nGlobal markets strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou has declared in recently published research notes that financial institutions’ interest in bitcoin trading “appears to be fading” as key metrics like the index of open interest in bitcoin futures, and average exchange volumes “have downshifted dramatically.”\nFurthermore, JP Morgan’s report says median bitcoin transaction sizes are down to $160 from the highs of around $5,000 seen just a year ago, adding that the more widely used contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are very close to “the bottom of 2018’s range” according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nPanigirtzoglou and his team attribute these downward trends to investors taking their money away from the cryptocurrency market but is that really the case?\nAre the Pros Really Ditching Bitcoin?\nEven though traditional metrics seem to support Panigirtzoglou’s position, recent data provided by other sources shows that the trends that JP Morgan regards as evidence of investors’ interest dwindling may actually be caused by investors taking their money elsewhere.\nJeffrey Sprecher CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and chairman of the New York Stock Exchange seems to disagree with Panigirtzoglou’s view. Sprecher recently said that despite the steep plunge bitcoin prices have taken in 2018, the answer to the question: “Will digital assets survive?” is “unequivocally yes”, adding:\nNo one has dropped out of crypto. [People may] have walked out but no one is walking away\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone believes the bear market is actually distorting perceptions of what’s really happening. McGlone thinks that despite current prices, the total number of combined contracts from the two venues (CBOE and CME) “is set to end the year at an all-time high,” which represents clear evidence that interest in these assets is on the rise. McGlone also added he thinks the market is “extremely oversold” which should hints at sharp rallies in the future.\nOTC Trading Is Gaining Ground\nTraditional metrics do not provide the full picture when gauging bitcoin’s future. Over-the-counter (OTC) transactions (performed outside of exchanges) are now believed to be capturing increasing volume. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in October: \nWhat I’ve heard is the OTC market is at least as large as the live recorded volumes [on exchanges]. So that is at least 50 percent of volumes that is not being reported on Coinmarketcap.\nAccording to a recent report by Diar, institutional money is steadily flowing into BTC as traders are moving away from exchanges and starting to take advantage of the OTC markets’ greater liquidity. Further, Diar’s data shows that even though OTC markets are open for only 31 percent of yearly tradable hours and trading volumes are still relatively small, there is a clear trend showing that OTC trading is on the rise. The report reads:\nWith no time stop on trading, institutions and big money would require access around the clock from fears of a rude awakening in a market that remains highly volatile despite that decreasing to new lows this year.\nGrayscale Investment Trust published data earlier this year showing that the bearish trends observed in 2018 have discouraged retail investors and speculators but have had the contrary effect on institutions, whose involvement in the market is “counter-intuitively” accelerating to levels never seen before by the Trust.\nPeer to Peer Transactions Are Also on the Rise\nAs with OTC transactions, peer-to-peer trading does not cause any price discovery, even though P2P platforms are moving millions of dollars worth of bitcoin around the world.\nTrading volumes on Localbitcoins are anything but bearish, with many countries experiencing massive increases in P2P trading. South American nations are leading the way with countries like Peru, Colombia and Argentina doubling or even tripling volumes since 2018’s crypto price crash began. In particular, economically battered Venezuela has seen an immense rise in Localbitcoins trading that is showing no signs of abating.\nThese trends suggest that JP Morgan Chase analysts may have misread the market and written it off too hastily. As P2P and OTC markets show, there’s plenty of life in Bitcoin yet. Coupled with the amount of infrastructure work being expended on improving wallets, exchanges and custodial solutions and it’s clear that the groundwork is being laid for the next wave of Bitcoin investors, both retail and institutional.\nWhat do you think the future holds for the BTC market?

    "text": "\n American ATM network Athena Bitcoin is continuing its aggressive expansion in Latin America, with now 17 ATMs in five cities in Colombia. The company is sure the ATMs are a good investment but news.Bitcoin.com spoke to Colombians who were, if anything, baffled by the new machines. \nAlso read: BCH Leads the Way as Crypto Markets Brighten Up\nVenezuelans the Biggest Users\nColombia’s second-largest city, Medellin, saw its third bitcoin ATM installed this month, bringing the total number of machines in the country up to 17. The latest in Medellin is not fully funcional just yet but the Midwest US-based cryptocurrency ATM network Athena Bitcoin told news.Bitcoin.com that there had been “a really good reaction” to the ATMs throughout the South American country.\nAthena’s latest Bitcoin ATM\nBut just who are using the machines? According to Athena, Venezuelans in Colombia are the biggest users of the ATMs, followed closely by freelancers working in tech or marketing. Athena’s Latin America director, Matias Goldenhörn, said: “There’s more volume – more transactions and more people using cryptocurrencies for everyday things – in Colombia, though it’s picking up across the region.”\n“There are a lot of freelancers in Colombia who receive their payments in bitcoin and they use our ATMs to get their money in fiat and then there are people sending remittances to Venezuela are using them. Those are the two main users we have now in Colombia.”\nThe machines, which support bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum (ETH), have sprouted up in Colombia’s five largest cities. The company plans to also open one in the border town of Cucuta, a hotspot for the thousands of Venezuelans now crossing into the country every day.\nAthena also has opened one ATM in Argentina, one in Mexico and another in Chile. Colombia has seen the biggest investment because people are more open to cryptos here – and in neighboring Venezuela – than in other Latin American nations, according to the company.\nBafflement and Intrigue\nAthena’s ATMs are designed to allow users to purchase cryptocurrency without a bank account, debit card or credit card. There are close to 70 scattered across the US and the company promises people can buy cryptocurrency from the machines in as little as 90 seconds with an appropriate crypto wallet on their smartphone.\nOther than tech-savvy freelancers or Venezuelans using the ATMs and crypto to deal with an economic crisis after fleeing their home country, others seemed confused, albeit intrigued, with the new ATM in Medellin. Writer and journalist, Julian Tabares, 26, said: “I think there are a lot of people in the city that have heard about Bitcoin, but we don’t really know how exactly it works. Some say it’s a bubble and I’m not sure how I would work the ATM.” \nWhile 23-year-old student Natalia Hernandez said: “It looks incredible to me, like really futuristic. I’ve read a bit about the technology and it sounds interesting – but I’ve no idea what that machine does.”\nAnd mother-of-four, Alicia Restrepo, 60, said: “I don’t know what it is, I don’t know what cryptocurrencies are. I’ve heard people talk about them, though.”\nOthers who spoke to news.Bitcoin.com were confused, disinterested or keen to learn more. A number were enthusiastic and said they’d research crypto after it was explained what it could do for them.\nThe potential in Latin America is therefore huge, Athena said. “Latin America has a high number of people who are unbanked or under-banked,” Goldenhörn told news.Bitcoin.com. “Around 70 percent. And there is a huge smartphone penetration, too, which makes a good case for using crypto.”\n“Based on the success we’ve had, we’re trying to raise $15 million and we’re in the middle of the round to continue accelerating the Latin America dispatch, to deploy hundreds of ATMs in the region.”\nWhat do you think about Athena’s rapid expansion in Latin America?

    "text": "\n Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has informed Belarusian customers that its services will no longer be available in their country. The announcement follows reports of similar restrictions for residents of other nations under economic sanctions, such as the Islamic Republic of Iran and Zimbabwe. \nAlso read: Russian Miners Sell Their Equipment Amid Market Plunge\nBelarusians Lose Access to Global Exchange\nThe correspondence from Binance, currently the world’s largest digital asset trading platform by daily volume, does not specifically say when the restrictions will go into effect, Forklog reported. However, the exchange notes that they are related to the latest update in its Terms of Use (ToU) and urges Belarusians to acquaint themselves with the changes.\nUnder “Prohibition of Use” on the ToU page, the exchange explains that by accessing and using any of its services, customers acknowledge and declare they are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists, such as those prepared by the U.N. Security Council and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC).\nBinance says that it “maintains the right to select its markets and jurisdictions to operate and may restrict or deny its services to certain countries.” The exchange also insists on its stance that “prohibited users are not to use or access Binance and any of its services” and reserves the right to modify or change the terms and conditions of its user agreement at any time and at its sole discretion.\nThe announcement comes shortly after Binance imposed restrictions on other countries under Western sanctions. In November, several global exchanges, including Binance, cut ties with Iran, according to members of the local crypto community. Zimbabweans have also been informed that the exchange is unable to provide services in their country and have been told to withdraw their funds.\nGleb Kostarev, a representative of Binance in the Russian Federation, has confirmed the authenticity of the Belarus announcement. Speaking to Forklog, he also noted that the new restrictions would not affect Russian residents. But the different treatment of the two countries raises questions about the rationale behind the decision.\nThe two nations are both members of the Eurasian Economic Union, which forms a common market. They are also subject to U.S. sanctions. But while Washington is constantly expanding its measures regarding Russia, sanctions relief has been granted for nine major Belarusian companies in the past three years. In October, OFAC extended the waivers for another year. The move is part of a policy aimed at encouraging reforms in the country, which is a traditional ally of Moscow.\nBelarusians Can Still Buy Cryptocurrencies\nBelarus is one of only a few jurisdictions in Europe that have adopted crypto-friendly regulations. The number of fintech entities operating in the country has been growing since President Alexander Lukashenko’s Decree No. 8 entered into force in March. The order legalized the business activities of crypto and blockchain companies registered with the Belarus High Technologies Park (HTP) in Minsk.\nThe circulation and exchange of cryptocurrencies, however, remain largely unregulated. There are no cryptocurrency exchanges in the HTP and Binance’s decision to restrict services in the country will make it even harder for Belarusians to buy, sell and trade coins.\nFortunately, other options are available. A number of online platforms offer exchange services in the post-Soviet space. Best Change, for example, lists dozens of verified online exchanges where crypto-enthusiasts can acquire and trade digital currencies, regardless of sanctions imposed by foreign powers or bans introduced by their own governments.\nMany platforms support popular payment methods such as Qiwi and Yandex Money, but credit/debit card purchases are also possible. Belarusians can order prepaid Mastercards from Belarusbank, a leading commercial bank in the country. Its Carte Blanche card supports deposits in four currencies — Belarusian rubles, Russian rubles, euros and U.S. dollars. The fiat funds can then be used to buy digital money on any of the Best Change-listed platforms supporting such transactions.\nPeer-to-peer exchanges such as Localbitcoins are also available to Belarusians who want to trade their coins. And Crexby, a platform recently launched by Belarusians in the U.S. as the first Belarusian crypto exchange, recently told news.Bitcoin.com that it plans to introduce support for Belarusian ruble trades. The company is already in contact with government officials in Minsk to ensure compliance with local regulations.\nWhat do you think about Binance’s move to stop services in Belarus?

    "text": "\n In today’s edition of Chatter Report, crypto influencers debate the importance of buy walls to support crypto prices, reason for and against miner anonymity and ponder the outcome of governments attacking bitcoin.\nAlso read: Markets Update: Bull Trap or Reversal? Traders Question the Recent Crypto Spike\nHodlers of Last Resort and Buy Walls\n\nEarly bitcoin adopter and investor in Kraken, Trace Mayer, argues that crypto market capitalizations are important, but not as important as the hodlers of last resort and “buy support.” Mayer reasons that the combination of investors who don’t panic sell their coins and buy orders that are reflected in order books are what keep crypto prices from sliding further down.\n\nHowever, Eric Wall argues that this is incorrect, because buy and sell orders are just an illusion. The cryptocurrency lead at Cinnober reasons that buy walls can be pulled quickly when market sentiment turns bearish, so data on order books can’t really be trusted. Wall’s distrust of order books is also shared by others in the thread, as they point out that over-the-counter market orders are unseen and obscure buy and sell data even further.\nShould Miners be Anonymous?\nAfter Nchain proposed the Optimal Miner Pseudo ID, crypto Twitter erupted in a fiery debate over whether miners should be anonymous or have their identities publicly known.\n\nDeveloper Chris Pacia argues that all miners should be anonymous because anonymity makes it more difficult for governments to shut down bitcoin. On the other hand, prominent bitcoiner Alex Pickard believes that miners should be known by the public, as that would “increase trust in the system,” which is better for the bitcoin ecosystem.\nThe argument then shifted focus to the purpose of Proof of Work (POW), with crypto-Twitter regular Karate McAwesome arguing that POW is set up for miner anonymity.\n\nPickard quickly disagreed, explaining that the point of POW is to prevent double spending and to maintain the fixed supply of bitcoin. He then elaborated, claiming that transparent miner identities could prevent the government from shutting bitcoin down.\nBitcoin vs. the State\nPicking up on the idea of governments trying to destroy bitcoin, cryptocurrency proponent Chris G and Bitcoin Uncensored’s Chris DeRose began their own separate discussion. The former argued that bitcoin would benefit from the government trying to destroy it.\n\nG reasons that after the Chinese government tried to shut down bitcoin from 2013 to 2015, the subsequent years were fantastic for bitcoin prices. G goes on to draw parallels between bitcoin and Christianity, explaining that governments initially killed all Christians until Constantine figured out how he could benefit from the religion.\nThroughout the thread, DeRose appears convinced of G’s arguments. By the end, both parties conclude that divisions in the bitcoin community are more dangerous than governments trying to destroy bitcoin.\nWhat do you think of the significance of buy walls and hodlers to support crypto prices?

    "text": "\n It has been widely reported this week that the U.S. government has blacklisted two BTC addresses linked to cyber crime. These particular addresses were singled out because their owners are believed to be Iranians, whose country is currently facing heavy economic sanctions from the U.S. While the BTC addresses are clearly connected to ransomware, mainstream media has gotten one crucial element of the story wrong: You can’t blacklist a bitcoin address.\nAlso read: BCH Upgrades: What’s New and What’s Next\nBitcoin: Unblockable Since 2009\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is the financial intelligence wing of the U.S. Treasury Department. It enforces economic sanctions against foreign entities the American government has taken exception to. Right now, it has Iran in its sights. By OFAC’s own admission, however, trying to blacklist bitcoin addresses is a first. “While OFAC routinely provides identifiers for designated persons, today’s action marks the first time OFAC is publicly attributing digital currency addresses to designated individuals,” explained the agency, adding:\nLike traditional identifiers, these digital currency addresses should assist those in the compliance and digital currency communities in identifying transactions and funds that must be blocked and investigating any connections to these addresses. As a result of today’s action, persons that engage in transactions with [these addresses] could be subject to secondary sanctions.\nYou Can’t Blacklist a Bitcoin Address\nThe addresses in question, 149w62rY42aZBox8fGcmqNsXUzSStKeq8C and 1AjZPMsnmpdK2Rv9KQNfMurTXinscVro9V, have been involved in over 7,000 transactions since 2013 and received close to 6,000 BTC. As of Nov. 28, anyone interacting with these addresses could technically be held liable by the U.S. government and punished in some way. In reality, though, these threats are little more than empty words. No one — not even the U.S. government, with its army of apparatchiks and enforcers — can prevent a specific address from sending or receiving bitcoin. With cryptocurrencies such as EOS or ripple, OFAC would likely have more success, but decentralized assets such as BTC and BCH are uncensorable.\nTwo of the addresses that have sent BTC to a ‘blacklisted’ Iranian address in the last 24 hours\nTo demonstrate the pointlessness of the blacklisting, both BTC addresses have received transactions in the past 24 hours. In one instance, vanity addresses were used to troll OFAC and to reiterate the futility of its digital currency sanctions. While cryptocurrency exchanges can and do block accounts linked to certain addresses, the Bitcoin protocol remains immune from such interference. Permissionless and stateless, bitcoin can’t be blacklisted. That’s why it’s so valuable.\nWhat are your thoughts on the U.S. ‘blacklisting’ bitcoin addresses?

    "text": "\n A court in Switzerland has ordered the closure of bitcoin mining startup Envion AG over concerns of poor corporate governance. The company raised $100 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in January, but a succession of boardroom wrangles have led to a breakdown in its corporate structure, bringing operations to a halt.\nAlso read: Canadian Bitcoin Miner Fortress Blockchain Reports $1.16M Loss in Q3\nFounding Partners Sue Each Other\nFounding partners Michael Luckow and Matthias Woestmann have repeatedly gone to court to sue each other over allegations of subterfuge, which supposedly took place at the time of the ICO or immediately after, according to a Handelsblatt Global report on Nov. 28.\n\nAmong other things, Woestmann, who has since resigned as board chairman, “accused Luckow of manufacturing more coins than agreed on, so he engineered a capital increase that diluted Luckow’s share,” the paper alleged.\nIn the capital increase, Woestmann allegedly issued actual shares, rather than tokens, effectively diluting the 81 percent stake of Luckow and his partners to 31 percent.\nNow, the cantonal court in Zug — Switzerland’s cryptocurrency haven — has ordered Envion to shut down, citing its lack of a functional board of directors and “the complete lack of any auditing function.” The company is to be liquidated, the court ruled.\nThe article quoted a Zurich-based lawyer, Urs Schenker, as saying that Envion would likely go under. Schenker said liquidation was “unavoidable” because the financial regulator appeared to have reached a decision to investigate the cryptocurrency miner.\nThe Lure of Riches\n\nEnvion raised about $100 million in an ICO that attracted 30,000 investors between December 2017 and January 2018, when the cryptocurrency gold rush was at its peak. Investors paid $1 for each token in the offer, lured by the promise of over 160 percent growth and Envion’s low-cost approach to mining, using renewable energy. Today, the token is worth just $0.05, reports say.\nHowever, relations between the founders went sour after the ICO, with accusations of cheating, causing operations at the company to come to a standstill. Handelsblatt Global reports that both Luckow and Woestmann are now under investigation by regulators in Switzerland and Germany.\nIt turned out that Envion’s finances and operations were being run from Berlin by Luckow’s company, Trado, even though the startup was registered in Switzerland. “Woestmann continues to blame Luckow, accusing him of not providing information about the ICO. Luckow says Woestmann always planned to push the firm into liquidation, but he will fight it and believes the original concept can still work,” the article said.\nThe Zug court ruling is not final, as either party can still appeal the decision. In the meantime, all that investors can do is wait and hope for the best, as failed ICOs have already cost investors billions of dollars in losses throughout the world.\nWhat do you think about the counter lawsuits at Envion?

    "text": "\n According to court documents filed in Seattle, Washington, the mining rig manufacturer Bitmain has filed a lawsuit against an unidentified suspect who hacked the company’s Binance account. Bitmain hopes to identify the defendant “John Doe” and recover the stolen BTC siphoned from the organization’s cryptocurrency holdings held on the exchange.\nAlso Read: Fork Watch: List of BCH Services Providing Fork Support\nBitmain Files a Lawsuit in Seattle, Washington \nIt seems Bitmain is currently suing an individual, but doesn’t know who the suspect is just yet. Right now, according to court documents, the company is in a “John Doe” lawsuit involving an unknown hacker and the cryptocurrency trading platforms Binance and Bittrex. According to the lawsuit filed by the litigation firm Perkins Coie LLP, Bitmain lost 617 BTC on April 22, 2018. This was when BTC/USD global spot market prices were approximately $8,935. At that time, the law firm believes, the hacker used the funds to inflate the prices of a lesser known cryptocurrency called decentraland (MANA) and pump and dump other smaller cryptocurrency markets. \n\n“Before the unauthorized trades on April 22, 2018, Bitmain’s digital wallet held approximately 890 BTC — After the unauthorized trades, Bitmain’s digital wallet had approximately 265 BTC,” the lawsuit explains. \nAfter facilitating wash trades and pumping the coins with tiny market valuations, using both Bitmain’s account and his own Binance wallet, the hacker then sent the stolen funds to Bittrex in order to manipulate more markets. Bitmain’s lawyers state that Doe intentionally accessed a protected computer without authorization in order to defraud Bitmain’s custodial wallet on Binance. The court documents further state: \nBy means of such conduct, John Doe furthered the intended fraud and obtained things of value, specifically Bitcoin and other digital assets, causing a loss to Bitmain exceeding $5,500,000.\n\nUsing the Discovery Process to Uncover the Fictitious Defendant\nBreaking international communications laws is the reason the court filing was processed in Washington. The law firm Perkins Coie believes the funds eventually landed in an account held on Bittrex, the Seattle-based trading platform. Doe’s unauthorized scheme to defraud was across state lines and was accomplished on the internet, which is used in interstate and foreign commerce and communications, the law firm emphasized. “[Doe’s] activities constitute a violation of the federal CFAA, 18 U.S.C.A. § 1030(a)(4),” the lawsuit further states. Perkins Coie details that Bitmain is entitled to damages under the CFAA Act and also wants to hold the suspect accountable.\nIt’s not unusual to sue a “John Doe” or “Jane Doe” in the United States as the suspect is known as a fictitious defendant. A Doe lawsuit or subpoena intends to uncover the identity of the fictitious defendant by using the courts to ultimately use the discovery process in order to uncover Doe’s name and location.\nWhat do you think about Bitmain’s “John Doe” lawsuit in the state of Washington?

The arbitration tribunal will also concentrate its efforts on preventing legal disputes, including in cases in which the state administration is involved.\nTIAC’s rulings will be enforceable in the territory of Uzbekistan, in accordance with local laws governing arbitration proceedings and international treaties to which the country is a party. Arbitrators will be allowed to use mediation and other mechanisms to resolve disputes within the framework of the law.\nAccording to Uzbekistani media, a supervisory board consisting of leading international experts will assist and monitor the implementation of global standards and practices by the arbitration center. President Mirziyoyev has tasked the country’s chamber of commerce with drafting a law “On International Arbitration” within a month, in order to create the legal basis for TIAC’s activities.\nUzbekistan’s Crypto-Friendly Policies\nThe government of Uzbekistan has been consistent in its efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency sector. In July, another presidential decree created conditions for the legalization of cryptocurrency transactions, blockchain technologies and mining. This past September, Shavkat Mirziyoyev authorized the introduction of a licensing regime for digital asset trading platforms. Two state-owned energy companies, Uzbekenergo and Uzbekgidroenergo, have been instructed to allocate land plots for industrial-scale mining facilities.\n\nWith the decision to set up an international arbitration center in Tashkent, Uzbekistan became the second country in the former Soviet space trying to implement the mechanism for resolving disputes in the cryptocurrency industry. This month, a leading industry organization in Russia announced plans to establish an arbitration body that will be tasked with settling disagreements between participants in the digital economy, including investors and startups conducting initial coin offerings (ICOs) and parties to smart contracts recorded on distributed ledgers.\nWhat do you think about the implementation of arbitration procedures in the crypto industry?

    "text": "\n In recent regulatory news, we report on an authorized mining company in China that has had its operations temporarily halted for tax inspection and implementation of real-name registration processes. We also look at the Michigan Secretary of State’s ban on crypto-based political donations, as well as the recent certification of X8’s stablecoin for Shariah compliance. In addition, we focus on the operator of a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme who has been punished for misappropriating $601,000 in BTC and LTC from his employer.\nAlso Read: President of Marshall Islands Challenged Over Cryptocurrency Plan\nChinese Mining Farms Suspended\nAccording to a statement published by an unidentified cryptocurrency mining company, Chinese state agencies have ordered the suspension of its mining farms in southwestern Guizhou Province and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region for tax inspections and to implement real-name registration processes.\n“According to the needs of the public security department’s network information security work, in the future, our company will implement higher standards for the company’s business real-name system according to the work needs of the public security department,” the anonymous company said. “For customers with the latest standard real-name systems, the data center will have to suspend reloading, restarting, moving in and out, etc.”\nMichigan Secretary of State Says ‘No’ to Crypto\nIn a letter addressed to William Baker, a recent candidate for the Michigan state legislature, the office of the Michigan Secretary of State has formally barred cryptocurrency donations to political campaigns.\nBaker, who lost his bid in the state’s Nov. 6 election, had previously sought clarification on how the value of donations in the form of cryptocurrencies should be recorded. He also asked whether virtual currency exchanges would qualify as valid secondary depositories for the storage of crypto assets.\nBaker asserted that “it is self-evident that digital currency is a valid way to receive political contributions.” However, the state secretary’s office responded by stating that “the law does not authorize such a vehicle, and the department has never determined that digital currencies are a valid way to receive political contributions.”\nThe letter also highlighted concerns pertaining to the price volatility of cryptocurrencies. “As with stocks and commodities, bitcoin’s worth fluctuates daily,” the office said. “There is no way to ascertain the precise monetary value of one bitcoin on any particular day.”\nThe Michigan Secretary of State raised additional objections to the use of cryptocurrencies as donations. In the letter, the office added that state legislation also “requires that committees deposit funds in an account in a financial institution, which is not an option for cryptocurrency.”\nX8 Stablecoin Certified as Shariah Compliant\nX8C, the stablecoin issued by Swiss fintech company X8 AG, has obtained a certificate showing that its stablecoin is compliant with Shariah law. It received the certification from the Shariyah Review Bureau, an Islamic advisory firm licensed by the Central Bank of Bahrain.\nFrancesca Greco, director and co-founder of X8, announced that the company will soon establish a regional office in the Middle East. Greco also indicated that X8 plans to launch a Shariah-compliant virtual currency exchange, adding that the company has already met with representatives of exchanges based in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Bahrain.\n“The Gulf region is a really good place for financial technology companies, because they all want to become hubs for fintech,” Greco said.\nCFTC Fines Crypto Scheme Operator Over $1.14M\nThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has ordered Joseph Kim, a resident of Phoenix, to pay more than $1.14 million for operating a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme. Kim was also sentenced to 15 months in prison on “related criminal charges” filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. According to the court order, Kim pleaded guilty to “orchestrating a fraudulent Bitcoin and Litecoin scheme that led to more than $1 million in losses.”\nKim was found to have misappropriated $601,000 worth of BTC and LTC from his employer — described as “a Chicago-based proprietary trading firm” — before attempting to fabricate security-related issues to obfuscate the misappropriation of funds. Despite this, the company fired Kim in November 2017 after the theft of the cryptocurrency was discovered.\nBetween December 2017 and March 2018, Kim then sought to repay his former employer through profits that he had generated through the operation of a cryptocurrency trading scheme. According to the CFTC, he “falsely told customers that he would invest their funds in a low-risk virtual currency arbitrage strategy, when, in fact, Kim made high-risk, directional bets on the movement of virtual currencies that resulted in Kim losing all $545,000 of his customers’ funds.”\nDo you think Chinese miners will report the temporary suspension of their operations for tax inspection and real-name registration?

    "title": " The hype surrounding blockchain and cryptocurrency has simmered to a dull roar. Last December, the markets spiked as traders",
    "text": "\n The hype surrounding blockchain and cryptocurrency has simmered to a dull roar. Last December, the markets spiked as traders drooled over the thought of lining their pockets. They believed they would be billionaires. They had erotic dreams of lambos, mansions, hookers and blow. Many of them embraced a get-rich-quick, shit-brained mentality. They put speculation over philosophy. The majority of them got financially destroyed for their greed. In their fragilista-like thinking, they either forgot the purpose of the technology or came into the space without acknowledging the crypto-anarchism that created it. \nAlso read: Markets Update: Stable Cryptocurrencies and Unstable Pegged Coins\nNovel Technology Is Fueled by Hype\nAnyone who has studied technological trends could have predicted what happened. Any novel technology is originally fueled by hype. When the technology emerges, new entrants see dollar signs. They want to exploit the technology to get rich. These people are pseudo-entrepreneurs or unprincipled traders. They don’t give a damn about changing the world, much less simplifying life for the average person.\nThere is nothing wrong with earning money or getting rich. That is what the capitalist spirit and entrepreneurial drive are all about. However, if people’s sole focus is to just to make money, they are doomed to failure. There has to be an underlying drive or motivating purpose. Without that fundamental principle guiding the entrepreneur, people are likely to go broke, fall prey to scams, or simply get rich but be unhappy.\nAmara’s Law\nThere is an explanation for why early technologies succumb to bad actors and people with unwholesome motivations. Amara’s Law provides an apt summation. The law states: “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.”\nThis overestimation of technology’s effect is accompanied by the fraudsters, pseudo-entrepreneurs, and other unsavory types. When technologies emerge, people take advantage of the newness; they take advantage of the newbies. In this timeframe, there is a swirl of misunderstanding surrounding the tech, and this is fertile ground for the creation of victims. Scam victims. The victims of hype. And victims of greed. In this regard, “overestimation” is a synonym for “hype,” which leads to bad behavior and avarice within the industry.\nConsolidation: Weeding out the Bad Actors and Scam Artists\nHowever, in the long term, the ecosystem naturally weeds out the bad actors. Many of them get thrown in government cages. The projects that aren’t scams simply fail, and much of the greed begins to dissipate as reality sets in. This is a consolidation phase. In the cryptocurrency environment, this consolidation phase is propped up by self-governance.\nCurrently, the crypto ecosystem is trying to discover ways to promote self-governance, rather than locking people in cages. This means developers are considering platforms to help vet companies within the space. Indeed, the community must fashion an environment of self-governance to stymie politicians and bureaucrats.\nMany in the ecosystem pontificate on the evil nature of scams and money grubbers, but then they vie for government to come solve all the problems. This is muddy thinking, and it verges on hypocrisy. If a person loathes fraudsters, the last thing they are going to do is invite government goons into the melee. Government is one of the largest criminal organizations and conduits of fraud to ever exist. Summoning them would be like calling a murderer to prevent murder. It makes zero sense.\nReawakening to the Purpose of Cryptocurrency\nPeople must acknowledge where cryptocurrency came from. They must recall the past in order to make decisions for the future. If they want to get lost in the hype, they should at least do some research on the cypherpunks and crypto-anarchists. Crypto-anarchy was the underlying motivating factor. It’s the reason for this technology.\nIn the long term, I don’t believe people will underestimate the technology via Amara’s law. The fact crypto was built to undermine the state apparatus is an idea that can never be underestimated, and thus people will begin embracing it. The beautiful thing about cryptocurrency is it changes people’s psychology. It teaches them about sound money, by rewiring their brain. It also reminds them they own themselves, and that no one deserves to extort the fruits of their labor. The crypto-anarchist dream, then, is the real source of hype – not all the speculation and ramblings about getting rich.\nDo you agree that crypto-anarchism should be the real driving force of cryptocurrency adoption? Let us know in the comments section below.

    "text": "\n Cryptocurrency prices have remained in a consolidated pattern over the last two weeks with a few ups and downs, but have remained fairly stable in recent days. The overall market capitalization of all 1900+ cryptocurrencies is valued at $221 billion with close to $12 billion worth traded over the last 24-hours.\nAlso read: Bitpay Phases Out Crypto-Debit Cards for European Cardholders\nCrypto-Markets Are Meandering Around as Traders Wait for a Break Out\nDigital asset traders are patiently waiting for a break-out of some sort, in any direction, but it’s safe to say a lot of people are waiting for that bearish-to-bullish reversal. Today, just before the weekend, cryptocurrency trade volumes globally have ticked up and prices are meandering along with 2-3 percent swings at times. Bitcoin core (BTC) is hovering around $6,596 at the time of publication with a $114 billion total market valuation. BTC is the top traded coin by trade volume, as BTC markets are capturing $3.8 billion in daily trades. The second highest valued capitalization held by Ethereum (ETH) is around $22.9 billion with each ETH trading for $224 per coin. Ripple (XRP) is being swapped for $0.53 and the currency’s valuation is awfully close to Ethereum’s market cap at $21.3 billion. Eos (EOS) markets are up 3.5 percent today as one eos is being exchanged for $5.75 per coin.\nTop ten cryptocurrencies October 4, 2018. \nBitcoin Cash Market Action\nBitcoin cash (BCH) markets are up only 0.9 percent today, and over the last seven days the currency has lost 8.3 percent. Today BCH is being traded for roughly $516 per coin and the overall market capitalization is $8.99 billion. With a 24-hour volume of around $452.9 million, bitcoin cash markets hold the sixth highest trading volume throughout the crypto-economy. The top five exchanges today swapping the most BCH include Lbank, Hitbtc, Binance, Okex, and Huobi. Tether (USDT) is the currency traded with BCH the most today as USDT captures 36.5 percent of the market. This is followed by BTC (34.1%), ETH (19.4%), USD (4.6%), and KRW (1.8%).\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) 10-4-18 3:20 p.m. EDT. \nBCH/USD Technical Indicators\nLooking at the daily and 4-hour BCH/USD charts on Bitfinex and Bitstamp show bears have managed to lower the price of BCH to get in on some cheaper coins. On the 4-hour charts, both the RSI (-36) and Stochastic oscillators show markets are remaining in oversold territories at press time. One thing that’s worth noting is the two Simple-Moving-Averages (SMA) are about to cross hairs and this could mean an upside trend reversal is in the cards. \nBCH/USD Bitfinex daily 10-4-18. \nThe 200 SMA is still slightly above the 100 SMA trendline showing for now the path toward the least resistance is still the downside. The 4-hour MACd shows room for improvement and Bollinger bands are extra tight. Looking at order books we can see lots of opposition at the current vantage point up until $550 and then again at $580. On the backside, if bears try and claw the price down more then there are thick foundations at $480 all the way to $460.\nBCH/USD Bitfinex 4-hour 10-4-18. \nThe Verdict: Traders Uncertain of a Bullish Reversal or Downside Break\nOf course, there are a lot of analysts who believe crypto prices will grow bullish again this year and some think BTC can hit $20K again. However this week on CNBC the CEO of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital, Michael Novogratz said he doesn’t think BTC will go above all-time highs in 2018 and continues, “I don’t think it breaks $9,000 this year.” During an interview this week the cryptocurrency analyst Nikola Lazić forecasted a downturn in prices.\n“I am expecting a breakout from the downside because the horizontal support has already been broken today, the red triangle’s support has been broken in the past when the price found support on the symmetrical triangle’s uptrend line which was respected in the past,” explains Lazić.\nThe analyst continues: \n\nIf that last support gets broken then we are definitely seeing a lower low which would be below $5,767 (£4,458).\n\nOverall markets, in general, have been consolidating and traders are simply waiting for the next spike or drop depending on which way they are betting. It’s safe to say enthusiasts and traders are still uncertain where markets will take them during the last quarter of the year.\nWhere do you see the price of Bitcoin Cash and other coins headed from here?

    "text": "\n Crypto exchange Coinex will pay out long-term dividends, interest, in bitcoin cash (BCH) for coinex token (CET) holders, according to its website announcement. “If your CET holdings are on Coinex, we’ll calculate the dividends into BCH and allocate directly to your accounts,” the company explained. \nAlso read: Bitcoin Cash Speaker Series II Brings Leading Bitcoiners Together\nCoinex to Pay Out Long-Term Interest in Bitcoin Cash\nWhat began as a widely circulated subreddit rumor appears to be confirmed. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinex will be paying out long-term dividends, or interest, in BCH for their CET holders, according to the company’s website.\n\nHong Kong-based Coinex, of which mining giant Bitmain is an investor, is a relatively young exchange, offering a range of crypto assets to be traded against the likes of BCH, bitcoin core (BTC), ether (ETH), and tether (USDT). It has a native token, CET, which can be traded against the others as well. Market makers are not charged a fee, while market takers pay a somewhat low 0.10% on trades. Coinex also processes over-the-counter trades and offers referral rewards. They employ a transparent method of token distribution, as all transaction fees collected and how they are distributed are displayed on the site in real-time.\nMonthly Allocation\nAs of the beginning of this month, “Coinex will release ‘Lock & Mine CET’ and execute [the] ‘Long-term dividend allocation plan,’” the company explained. Holding a minimum 10,000 CET is required to receive BCH dividends, and none of the tokens may be acquired through mining – only ‘released’ CET qualify toward the offer. “Coinex will take a snapshot at 0:00 (UTC) everyday and allocate rewards of the previous day according to the snapshot results.” \n“To guarantee the sustainable development of CET and interests of CET holders,” Coinex continued, “we decided to release a long-term dividend allocation plan by which CET holders will continue to receive dividends after ‘Trade-driven mining’ ends.” Allocation of BCH will occur monthly, and within seven business days of a new month. As always, that date might vary still depending on exactly when final settlement occurs. \n“80% of Coinex’s total revenue will be allocated to CET holders and the remaining 20% is kept for Coinex development and daily operations,” the execution plan detailed. The exchange will also use a significant portion of its revenue to “repurchase CET from the secondary market and allocate to the qualified CET holders proportionately,” and holders can determine their personal ratio by dividing held CET by the total CET in circulation.\nDo dividends and interest attract you to an exchange?

They could be self-regulatory organizations or similar structures that help to define and enforce best practices and standards and accountability across the industry and there are efforts underway to start thinking about and building these types of organizations.”\n“There are lots of precedents in the traditional financial markets that we can look to for innovative governance structures that apply with markets that touch multiple jurisdictions,” he added.\nWhat is your response to France’s proposed regulations for crypto-asset intermediaries?

    "text": "\n Russia is preparing for the long-awaited legislation tailored to regulate its crypto space. According to the latest reports from Moscow, the term “cryptocurrency” has been taken out of the legal texts. Nevertheless, Russians have no reasons to doubt the existence of the decentralized electronic cash. They have many options to get involved in cryptocurrency, regardless of what the law says about it. \nAlso read: Iran to Allow Mining Hardware Imports, Cyprus Creates Fintech Hub\nReport: Revamped Law on Digital Assets Drops ‘Cryptocurrency’\nThe Russian crypto regulatory framework has been delayed for months. In May, three bills were filed in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, and were scheduled for adoption in July, as ordered by President Putin himself. However, deputies found it hard to synchronize and compile the drafts into a single legislation – after the first reading this spring, they postponed the second reading and the final voting for the fall session.\nThe revised law “On digital financial assets” will be presented for public discussions in October and hopefully adopted by the end of the year. The word cryptocurrency has created a lot of headaches for Russian lawmakers. They’ve been trying to come up with legal definitions for a number of new terms associated with the fintech industry without contradicting the current law which regards the ruble as the only legal tender and bans all money surrogates. It turns out they have decided to get rid of “cryptocurrency” altogether, according to Izvestia – the outlet claims to have seen the latest version of the draft.\n\nAnother significant update concerns crypto mining. Initially, the law defined the activity as the process of creating cryptocurrency. Now Izvestia writes that the document describes it as the issuance of tokens for the purpose of attracting capital investments – a definition that better suits ICOs in fact. In any case, tokens will represent property rights and ownership stakes. Registered local and foreign companies and private individuals will be allowed to issue digital coins, provided they are secured with other assets.\nIt’s also worth noting that an alternative bill has been proposed by an industry organization uniting some of the largest business enterprises in the country. Unlike the state-sponsored law, this draft authored by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RUIE) stipulates granting a special status to cryptocurrencies.\nThe Dogs Bark but the Caravan Moves On\nIt’s highly unlikely that the Russians will suddenly stop buying, selling and using cryptocurrency, just because the term does not appear in the legal lexicon of their deputies. A great number of trading platforms offer them the opportunity to enter the crypto ecosystem. Payment processors and banks continue to work with exchanges and exchangers, despite the legal uncertainty at the present moment and the upcoming ambiguous legislation.\nLocal crypto media listed some of the most popular platforms in Russia – Exmo, Livecoin, Yobit, Hitbtc, C-cex, and Spectrocoin. Another article rated the platforms according to their trading volume – Binance, Exmo, Livecoin, Yobit, Hitbtc, Poloniex, and others. Some of them, like the UK-based Exmo, support crypto-ruble trades and are popular not only in the Russian Federation, but also in the former Soviet space, including Ukraine where it is one of the three leading exchanges, along with Kuna and BTC Trade UA.\nThere are plenty of options to trade and no law is going to take them away from Russian citizens who want to get involved in cryptocurrency. A third post published recently detailed how crypto enthusiasts in Russia can exchange coins with rubles and get their money sent to their bank accounts, crypto and fiat wallets. A plethora of platforms process both crypto-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat transactions, whether members of the State Duma realize that or not.\nA useful service called Best Change offers Russians the opportunity to get the most favorable exchange rate for their currency, digital or fiat. Just pick a pair – BCH or BTC to a Qiwi rubles wallet, Yandex Money to Ethereum, or a number of other combinations with bank transfers and card payments – and the website will spit back dozens of verified online exchangers supporting the desired transaction. Traders can check the digital reserves of each platform, use statistical market data, and even get email notifications when someone is ready to meet their price.\nDo you think the future of cryptocurrencies depends on the regulations adopted by governments?

    "title": " The Satoshi Revolution: A Revolution of Rising Expectations Section 4: State Versus Society Chapter 10, Part 2 The Crypto",
    "text": "  \n\n The Satoshi Revolution: A Revolution of Rising Expectations\nSection 4: State Versus Society\nChapter 10, Part 2\nThe Crypto Revolution Will Not Be Centralized\nYou say you want a revolution. Well, you know,\nWe all want to change the world.\nYou tell me that it’s evolution. Well, you know,\nWe all want to change the world…\nBut when you talk about destruction\nDon’t you know that you can count me out…\nYou say you got a real solution. Well, you know,\nWe’d all love to see the plan.\nYou ask me for a contribution. Well, you know,\nWe’re all doing what we can…\n–John Lennon\nRevolutions generally occur when two circumstances converge. State and society are in raw opposition on issues upon which there is no compromise; and the state can no longer contain dissent. Modern states and central banks have pushed the exploitation of average people too far. It is not merely that people are refusing to assist in the looting of their own wealth, it is also that financial systems are in one stage or another of collapse. Cryptocurrency provides an escape route for people to take back their own financial power. It also confronts the state with dissent that cannot be controlled.\nCommon denominators ensure the continuing success of the crypto revolution. One characteristic: users bypass statist institutions, like central banks and centralized exchanges (Trusted Third Parties, or TTPs), by using peer-to-peer transfers and decentralized platforms. Indeed, the desire to avoid financial TTPs was what created Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto’s White Paper introduces Bitcoin with the words, “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” In short, without state involvement-without TTPs.\nIn the political arena, the trusted third party problem dooms most revolutions. A discontented populace relies on revolutionary leaders to overthrow tyranny and to follow through on constructing a better world. The leaders rally the popular support they need in order to grasp power and, then, they are supposed to produce the promised results. But political TTPs do not champion or represent the average person any more than financial ones do, which is to say, not at all. The new leaders become the new boss—same as the old boss, or worse.\nBy contrast, crypto users control their own reins of power, without a need for leadership. This individual control leads to the second characteristic that ensures the crypto revolution’s success: self-interest. Crypto is driven by the pure and diverse self-interest of millions of people.\n\nSelf-Interest: Another Assurance of Revolutionary Success\nResponse to the word “self-interested” is usually negative, and intensely so. It is seen as a synonym for “greedy,” “selfish,” “amoral,” or “inhumane.”\nBut self-interest is not a matter of ethics but of praxeology, which is the science of human action. According to praxeology, every human action that is not reflexive, like sneezing, is purposeful. If someone acts, it is in order to achieve a goal that may be consciously realized or not. Even slightly shifting in a chair is prompted by a desire to relieve discomfort, improve a line of vision, relieve boredom… If an action serves no purpose whatsoever, then it does not occur.\nSelf-interest is simply goal-directed behavior, and the natural, healthy goal of all human beings is to improve their lives. In basic terms, this means procuring food, warmth, shelter, and the other necessities that allow life to continue. In evolved terms, this means securing the means to care for loved ones, to provide safety against hardship, and to build prosperity. When self-interest is pursued through work, merit, and trade, then the cumulative activity of “selfish” people creates a safe and prosperous society in which cooperation benefits everyone. It establishes freedom.\nEthics come into play when the phrase “enlightened” or “rational self-interest” enters the discussion. What constitutes “enlightened self-interest” has been analyzed ever since man knew enough to build a fire around which to sit and talk. Modern cynics conclude that self-interest lies in being powerful enough to screw others over with impunity, but this has not been the consensus opinion of philosophers and average people. Ancient Greek philosophy located self-interest in self-control, honesty, friendship, and the other classical virtues that were essential to happiness. Average people locate self-interest in self-respect, family, meaningful work, community, and the other reasons they get up in the morning. If a person defines his “enlightened self-interest” by how much pain he can inflict or how many cars are in his garage, then it is a comment upon his failure as a human being, not upon the value of self-interest. If he attempts to attribute his personal failure to the nature of mankind, it is no more than a moral sleight of hand by which to escape judgment.\nA reasonable question arises; Aren’t all revolutions motivated by self-interest, even the ones that fail? The answer is, “of course.” No one trades the safety of obedience for the risk of uprising unless they are motivated by extreme self-interest. The motive can be material, such as a demand for land or food; it can be an injustice, such as racial or religious persecution. The existing violation of self-interest must be strong enough to make people gamble on being arrested, harmed, or having their families punished.\nBy contrast, crypto users who spurn the system do not need to take to the streets, to sign manifestos, or to confront the military. Their revolution of self-interest can occur in the comfort and relative safety of homes, behind closed doors.\nThe follow through is when self-interest breaks down in most revolutions. The old regime has been swept away; the new order prepares to govern. With eerie predictability, the new order issues the same demands that caused people to rebel against the old one: obedience, unquestioning belief, tribute, and respect for the privileges of the elite. The revolution has become centralized, and it is no longer responsive to the decentralized needs of the people whom it now views as a threat. After all, the people upended the former authority. Most individuals do not invite ideologues or armed guards into their homes and businesses. They do not welcome the “opportunity” to exhaust their lives in fulfilling the ambitions of an elite rather than in attending to their own self-interest. But they do so anyway, and the revolution is dead.\nThe reasons for compliance vary widely. Fear, peer pressure, respect for the law, weariness, an attempt to curry favor, confusion, hopelessness… The inevitable “moral” campaigns that the new order launches against self-interest are a strong factor, as well. Their highest virtue is patriotism; without it, parents would not send children off to die in wars in foreign lands. The individual must be sacrificed to the greater good; otherwise, people would not sacrifice their time and money—which is their lives—to benefit strangers. It is everyone’s duty to obey the state; this is the veil under which neighbors turn in neighbors, officials imprison children, and soldiers execute those who voice disagreement.\nCrypto avoids the lethal pitfalls of centralized follow-through. There is no need to sweep away an old regime; the status quo falls of its own weight when it is ignored and rendered irrelevant. There is no new regime of elites to impose their self-serving demands; if there were, the ever-increasing privacy and anonymity of crypto would make widespread intervention problematic. After the revolution succeeds, users act in the same manner as they did before; they exercise a personal control of crypto that furthers their own self-interests.\n\nMeans Versus Ends, Versus Means Are The Ends\nThe foregoing expresses another difference between crypto and other revolutions. Crypto has no wall of separation between means and ends, between the method of achieving revolution and the end results. Typical revolutionaries proclaim that equality, justice and prosperity will arise when the status quo is destroyed and the counterrevolutionaries crushed. At that point, paradise will emerge. But means and stated ends are vastly separated, with paradise often coming to resemble hell. And it is not always because revolutionary leaders are insincere opportunists.\nGandhi espoused nonviolent revolution because he understood the intimate connection between method and results. The means were the ends in progress. In the weekly journal Young India, Gandhi wrote, “They say ‘means are after all means’. I would say ‘means are after all everything’. As the means so the end… There is no wall of separation between means and end. Indeed the Creator has given us control (and that too very limited) over means, none over the end. Realization of the goal is in exact proportion to that of the means. This is a proposition that admits of no exception.” Violence breeds violence. Lies require more lies. Power grabs result in the exercise of power over others. Equally, the peaceful pursuit of self-interest produces a society in which self-interest is peacefully pursued. A revolution gets what it gives. With crypto, the method is individual control of a financial system that bypasses the state. The goal is individual control of a financial system that bypasses the state.\nAnother criticism confronts the idea of a crypto revolution. Namely, that the use of crypto is said to be too diverse and dispersed to constitute an real uprising. This is a collectivist view of revolution that postulates the need for a common cause and consciousness. Crypto does not have either. A user in Venezuela, who is desperate to hedge the inflation of fiat, is not politically the same as a user in Germany, who profits from converting one crypto to another. They do not share goals or communicate. How can they form a revolution?\nEasily. Consider the printing press. Like crypto, it caused a revolution through technology that allowed people to escape a monopoly of authority; with the printing press, it was the monopoly that state and church held on knowledge. Many technological breakthroughs, like the telephone, do not threaten authority. But the printing press and crypto invaded areas that the status quo considered to be their prerogatives.\nWhen Gutenberg engineered an affordable and manageable means by which average people could mass-produce documents, then opinions, propaganda, and information exploded. The material printed had different goals, and publications often contradicted each other. The books and pamphlets were issued in dozens of nations and languages; often, they had been translated by people who did not know or coordinate with the original author. And, yet, everyone was part of the same revolution that gave birth to the Enlightenment. The revolution was freedom of speech through which average people were empowered by printing and reading material that they deemed to be in their self-interest. The revolution in free speech and knowledge occurred from the cumulative impact of the decentralized self-interest of strangers.\nRevolutions do not need to be centralized. Centralization only returns people to the need for trusted third parties called leaders. Revolutions do not need a coordinated or collective consciousness. If collectivism is the means, then it is likely to be the result as well. The most effective revolution may well be a decentralized one that satisfies the uncoordinated self-interest of individuals. It may be what people refer to as “the free market.”\nWriting again in Young India, Gandhi compared social change to “a beautiful tree, not one of whose millions of leaves is like any other. Though…they are from one seed and belong to the same tree, there is none of the uniformity of a geometrical figure about any part of a tree. And yet we know that the seed, the branches and the leaves are one and the same. We know too that no geometrical figure can bear comparison with a full-blossomed tree in point of beauty and grandeur.”\n\nConclusion\nYet another commanding advantage of the crypto revolution is overlooked. Namely, it does not arise as the last option of despair or rage. It comes from hope for a better future. In political theory, this is known as “a revolution of rising expectations.”\n[To be continued next week.]\nReprints of this article should credit bitcoin.com and include a link back to the original links to all previous chapters Central Banks, community, dissent, Family, Gandhi, leadership, N-Featured, peer-to-peer transfers, praxeology, Satoshi Nakamoto, The Satoshi Revolution, Trusted third parties, Wealth, Wendy McElroyWendy McElroy has agreed to ”live-publish” her new book The Satoshi Revolution exclusively with Bitcoin.com.

    "text": "\n Law enforcement officials in Russia have seized 22 BATMs installed at stores and restaurants in 9 different cities. The confiscation has been carried out on orders from the Prosecutor’s Office and the Central Bank, local media reported. The operation of crypto teller machines in the country is currently unregulated.  \nAlso read: Kiev’s Bessarabsky Market Accepts Cryptocurrencies for Groceries\nLaw Enforcement Confiscate BATMs in Russia\nPolice officers have confiscated at least 22 automated teller machines selling cryptocurrency in shopping malls, stores and restaurants in nine Russian cities. All of the seized terminals are operated by Bbfpro which maintains a network of bitcoin ATMs across the vast country, RBC reported quoting lawyer Sarkis Darbinyan from the Digital Rights Center (DRC) who is representing the company’s interests. His organization specializes in providing legal assistance to businesses from the digital industry including crypto and blockchain firms.\nBbfpro’s manager, Artem Bedarev, told the Russian media his company had not received any queries from the authorities prior to the seizure. He said he was told informally that the investigation will continue at least six months and the machines will not be returned before it’s completed. An officer who participated in the confiscation on Friday said the operation was ordered by the Prosecutor General’s Office following a request from the Central Bank of Russia (CBR).\nA CBR official declined to provide details on the case with Bbfpro’s ATMs but pointed out that the regulator conducts “systematic work to identify and counteract illegal activities in the financial market.” He further explained that the possibility for uncontrolled cross-border transfer of funds and their subsequent cash out increases the risk of using cryptocurrencies in illicit schemes. The Ministry of Interior and the Prosecutor’s Office did not respond to media inquiries about the operation.\nBbfpro to Appeal Against the Seizure\nSarkis Darbinyan noted that the current legislation in the Russian Federation does not prohibit the acquisition of cryptocurrencies. He also emphasized that the company he represents observes all legally established procedures, pays its taxes and performs identity verification of users even in the absence of a mandatory requirement. The lawyer added that Bbfpro is currently assessing the financial damages resulting from the seizure of its BATMs and will appeal against the actions of the law enforcement agencies.\nAccording to Bbfpro’s website, its devices support purchases of bitcoin core (BTC) and other unspecified cryptocurrencies. The firm works with Exmo, a popular crypto exchange in the former Soviet space, and offers technical support for the teller machines. The installation of a single terminal costs 155,000 rubles, or approximately $2,300 USD. For its services, the company charges 1 percent on the registered turnover.\n\nCryptocurrencies and related activities such as trading, mining and crowdfunding are not yet legalized and regulated in Russia. This is expected to happen during the fall session of the State Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, which starts in September. Three bills were voted on first reading in May – “On Digital Financial Assets,” “On Attracting Investments Using Investment Platforms,” and “On Digital Rights”. Deputies tried to synchronize the drafts before the summer recess but eventually decided to postpone the final adoption.\nWhat do you think about the actions of the Russian law enforcement agencies?

Palladium is a platform for Initial Convertible Coin Offerings (ICCOs) meant to attract institutional investors to enter the crypto tokens field, powered by Bittrex’s technology. The companies have not revealed the investment amount yet but Palladium’s fundraising target is €150 million by a pre-sale of tokenized securities. According to its launch announcement from back in July, 50% of the proceeds are earmarked to go towards the acquisition of a controlling interest in a European bank. Paolo Catalfamo, founder and chairman of Palladium, said: “We are excited to have such a global player on board. Bittrex’s investment in Palladium is a confirmation of Malta’s sound decision to be at the forefront of regulating blockchain technology.”\nATM Market to Grow Over 50% a Year\nMarketsandmarkets, a B2B market research firm, has released a new report about the Crypto ATM Market stating it is expected to grow from $16.3 million in 2018 to $144.5 million by 2023, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 54.7%. And among all types of machines, the 2-way crypto ATM segment is likely to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period.\nIn a global comparison, North America is expected to hold the largest share of the crypto ATM market by 2023. The US specifically is expected to dominate the market during the forecast period due to the presence of a large number of hardware and software providers as well as a favorable investment environment, the researchers say. The report profiles key players in the market around the world, including: General Bytes (Czech Republic), Genesis Coin (US), Lamassu (UK), Covault (US), Bitaccess (Canada), Coinme (US), Coinsource (US), Bitxatm (Germany), Orderbob (Austria), and Rusbit (Russia).\nFirefox to Block Cryptojacking by Default\nNick Nguyen, Vice President of Product Strategy at Mozilla, has recently revealed that their popular Firefox browser will block cryptojacking by default in the near future. This is done as part of a series of moves meant to help combat tracking and the loss of performance on the web. He explained to unfamiliar users that some “sites have deployed cryptomining scripts that silently mine cryptocurrencies on the user’s device. Practices like these make the web a more hostile place to be. Future versions of Firefox will block these practices by default.”\nAs we previously reported, the developers of the Opera browser announced they will start offering protection against cryptocurrency mining scripts right out of the box back in December 2017, and the Brave browser has been offering protection against malicious cryptocurrency miners by default since September of the same year.\nOxford to Research Green Mining Technology\nUniversity College Oxford (Univ) has established a new “Research Centre for Blockchain”. The academic body is headed by Univ’s Fellow Professor Bill Roscoe, with a background of over 30 years in concurrency, automated verification, applied cryptography and payment protocols. He is joined by a group of experts in similar areas and they are working to “vastly improve” the efficiency of mining and trust models, to build new models of privacy and escrow, and to create models of fair exchange to support secure exchanges. The group will also focus on long term challenges such as the threat posed to the field by quantum computers. Professor Roscoe stated: “The new centre focuses on bringing the blockchain to the mainstream. This vision will be achieved by using green mining technology and embracing regulation through appropriate Know Your Client (KYC) guidelines.”\nWhat do you think about today’s news tidbits?

Bitcoin Cash – Dollar (BCH/USD) futures will be added to Crypto Facilities’ lineup of bitcoin core (BTC), ripple (XRP), litecoin (LTC), and ethereum (ETH) contracts.\n“We are pleased to be expanding our cryptocurrency derivatives offering with the launch of Bitcoin Cash futures,” Timo Schlaefer, CEO of Crypto Facilities told news.Bitcoin.com.\n\nBCH is a top five coin with a market capitalisation of around $10 billion and we expect our new contracts to spur the evolution of the crypto markets by bringing greater liquidity and transparency to the digital asset class.  \n\n\nA Proper BCH Hedging Mechanism at an FCA-Registered Exchange\nCrypto Facilities says the new products will allow individuals and institutions the ability to invest in BCH futures in a regulated, transparent and secure trading environment. The Bitcoin Cash-Dollar futures contracts will allow long and short positions giving investors the capability to manage risks and rewards in a different fashion. Bert Mouler, CEO of Profluent Group, says there’s been demand for a BCH derivatives product and is thrilled to see Crypto Facilities take the initiative.\n“Profluent Japan welcomes the opportunity to make markets in BCH derivatives on the Crypto Facilities platform,” Mouler explains during the Crypto Facilities BCH product announcement.\n\nThe institutional trading community was in great need of a proper BCH hedging mechanism at an FCA-registered exchange with a first class management team.  Crypto Facilities is the first to provide such a service.  \n\nIn addition to the cryptocurrency derivatives offered, Crypto Facilities also provides CME Group with the Bitcoin Reference Rate alongside the Ether-Dollar Reference Rate and Real-Time Index. There is another exchange that offers BCH/USD futures but over the years there have been lots of discrepancies with the trading platform’s trade volumes and market data. The BCH futures product offered by Crypto Facilities will be the first bitcoin cash derivatives against the USD that’s regulated by the UK’s FCA. \nWhat do you think about Crypto Facilities launching a Bitcoin Cash futures product?

    "text": "\n Over the past few days, cryptocurrency markets have been showing bullish gains after a few small retractions during the weekend. At the moment the entire digital asset economy is valued at $285Bn while $14.3Bn worth of trades were swapped over the past 24-hours. Today on July 23 bitcoin core (BTC) markets are holding an average price of $7,700 per BTC. Meanwhile, bitcoin cash (BCH) prices are hovering around $815 per BCH at press time.\nAlso read: A Discussion With the Prolific Bitcoin Developer Unwriter\nAre the Tides Turning for Cryptocurrencies?\nA good portion of cryptocurrencies on Monday are seeing some gains after some good dips that took place over the weekend. Most digital assets are consolidating losses while a few others like BTC, BCH, LTC, and XMR are up between 1-2% today. Bitcoin core dominance  (the percentage of BTC’s market capitalization among all 1,600+ assets) has been steadily moving up over the past few weeks and touched a high of 46 percent today. The top five digital currencies with the most trade volume today includes BTC, USDT, ETH, EOS, and BCH. Many crypto-enthusiasts and traders are optimistic the tides have changed after months of bearish prices plagued cryptocurrency markets.\nBitcoin Core (BTC) Market Action \nBitcoin core (BTC) market action shows the cryptocurrency is being sold at prices between $7,650-7,710 per coin. BTC’s market capitalization is around $132Bn, and 24-hour trade volume is about $4.8Bn worth of swaps. The top exchanges trading the most BTC include Bitlfyer, Bitfinex, Fcoin, Binance, and Coinbene. \n\nThe Japanese yen is the most dominant pair today with BTC commanding more than 54 percent of global trades. This is followed by tether (USDT 28.8%) USD (11.3%), EUR (2%), and KRW (1.5%). The top trade today on the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange Shapeshift.io is ethereum (ETH) for bitcoin core.\n\nBTC/USD Technical Indicators\nLooking at the BTC/USD charts on Bitstamp and Coinbase shows BTC bulls are trying to break massive resistance between the current vantage point to get past the $7,950-8,100 regions. The 4-hour chart shows the Relative Strength Index (RSI 62.9) is nearing the overbought zone at press time. However, the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is above the longer term 200 SMA, which means buyers could take the upside after breaking some more resistance. MACd lines continue to confirm short-term upper movement is in the cards as the MACd histogram shows room for more improvement. \n\nSo far it looks as though bulls could press past the $8K region as the upside trend looks strong while observing the Average Directional Index (ADX). Looking at order books shows BTC bulls have some thick resistance to crack above the EMA 200 resistance $7,950 zone and there will be another pitstop around the $8,250 region. On the backside, if bulls get exhausted and bearish sentiment takes over there is strong support between now and $7,350 and also another stop at $6,850 if markets dropped lower.\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Market Action \nBitcoin cash (BCH) markets are showing an average price of $820 per coin this Monday. The cryptocurrency currently has a market valuation of around $14.1Bn and trade volume has dropped a touch since our last markets update to $617Mn over the last 24-hours. The top trading platforms exchanging the most BCH today includes Coinex, Okex, Binance, Hitbtc, and Bitfinex. \n\nThe biggest trading pair with BCH today is tether (USDT) which captures 50.4 percent of global BCH trades. This is followed by BTC (29.1%), USD (9.8%), KRW (2.4%) and ETH (2.35%). The EUR also commands roughly 1.7 percent of today’s BCH swaps on July 23.\n\nBCH/USD Technical Indicators\nObserving the technical indicators on the daily and 4-hour Bitfinex BCH/USD charts show the price has been somewhat stable lately with charts showing slight variances here and there over the past week. The short-term 100 SMA is slightly above the 200 SMA trendline indicating the path of least resistance should be towards the upside. The 4-hour chart indicates that the Relative Strength Index (RSI 52.4) is meandering in the middle showing a small period of trading uncertainty. \n\nThe Average Directional Index (ADX) confirms bulls still have the reigns, and the strength of market conditions remains solid for the short term. Looking at order books and the EMA 200 shows strong resistance between the $850-925 zone. BCH bulls will need to eat away at these orders to continue maintaining upward momentum. On the back side, order books show some strong foundations between the current vantage point and $760, while after that region books begin to thin out. \nCould We Be on the Cusp of a Massive Bull Run?\nEnthusiasts and traders are still skeptical of what will take place next within the land of cryptocurrency markets. All of the digital assets have had mediocre trade volumes since last week as general markets are seeing a slight dip in crypto-swaps over the past few days. Bulls are making some moves northbound but the volumes show conviction is lacking. However, many crypto-proponents believe the upcoming bitcoin-based exchange-traded-fund (ETF) decision this August is what’s fueling the current pumps over the last week. For example, the senior market analyst at Etoro, Mati Greenspan, believes a market reversal is imminent. Greenspan explains to his Twitter followers:\n\nWe might just be on the cusp of the largest bitcoin bull run in history.\n\nWhere do you see the price of BCH, BTC, and other coins headed from here?

    "text": "\n In recent regulatory news, Malta’s financial regulator has sought to clarify the nation’s cryptocurrency regulations following the passing of an act pertaining to crypto assets, UK-based wealth managers have called for the FCA to take a strong stance regarding cryptocurrencies, and the deputy governor of Bank of Israel has predicted that cryptocurrencies will contribute to the financial system in future.\nAlso Read: A Look at Leverage Trading: Learn to Run With the Bears and Ride the Bulls\nMalta Clarifies Current Regulatory Apparatus Regarding Cryptocurrencies\nThe Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) has sought to clarify the country’s legislative apparatus pertaining to cryptocurrency following the passing of the “Virtual Financial Assets Act” on the 4th of July.\nIn a press release published by the MFSA which states that the act “it is not yet in force,” and that such won’t take effect until a date that “the Minister for Digital Economy may establish by notice in the Government Gazette.”\nThe statement asserts that the MFSA is currently developing the “Virtual Financial Assets Framework” which “underlies and complements” the act. Public consultation regarding the proposed framework ended on the 20th of July. The MFSA release seeks to emphasize that the framework is “not yet in force,” adding that “the MFSA will be in a position to start receiving requests for approvals and authorizations under the Act once the Framework is operational.”\nAdditionally, the public consultation period for Malta’s “Consultation Paper on the Virtual Financial Assets Rules for VFA Agents presenting Chapter 1 of the proposed Virtual Financial Assets Rulebook” ends on 31 July 2018. Consultation periods regarding chapters 2 and 3 of the proposed rulebook are also expected to begin in coming weeks.\nUK Wealth Managers Call for Stronger Crypto Regulations\nUK-based wealth management firms Wealthify, Nutmeg, and Scalable Capital have urged the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to adopt a stringent regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies.\nRichard Theo, the chief executive officer of Wealthify, describes the FCA as having been “way too slow” in its response to cryptocurrencies.” Mr. Theo added that as a regulated firm, “there are a lot of tests we have to do before we can take on a client. But that same client can go and buy bitcoin with no questions asked. There are far more risks involved when investing in bitcoin. The FCA should get on to it fast.”\nScalable Capital chief executive officer, Simon Miller, asserted that “People see the explosion of digital currencies and say ‘I can make a lot of money quickly.’ But that’s not investing — that’s gambling. It needs to be looked at.”\nNutmeg’s James McManus added, “With cryptocurrencies gaining media attention for large gains but little to no attention for large losses, perhaps now is the time for regulators to take a closer look at the selling process around cryptocurrencies.”\nBank of Israel Deputy Governor Predicts Cryptocurrencies Will “Contribute” to Financial System\nThe deputy governor of the Bank of Israel, Dr. Nadine Bodo-Trachtenberg, asserted that “The technology of distributed and encrypted currencies has the “potential to contribute to the monetary and financial system in the long term” whilst speaking at the recent Bit2c Crypto Conference.\nWhilst presenting the Israeli central bank’s position on virtual currencies, the Bank of Israel deputy governor downplayed the potential creative destruction that many have argued cryptocurrencies could cause within the financial industries, stating “I am told that digital coins can leave users with control over data and allow decentralization. But that’s what they promised about the internet – which ultimately created huge information giants that hurt competition. Token trading and smart contracts is a technology that expands the possibilities of money and trading in assets today, can streamline processes that pass through many intermediaries.”\nDo you agree that cryptocurrencies will be a significant contributor to the mainstream financial system in future?

    "text": "\n Voyager, a startup backed by Uber co-founder, Oscar Salazar, has announced that it will launch a commission-free cryptocurrency trading platform. It is intended to function as an aggregation engine for cryptocurrency prices across more than a dozen trading venues. \nAlso Read: J-Pop Star GACKT Caught Between Crypto Company Spindle and Minister’s Gaffe\nStartup Founded by Uber Alumni to Host Fee-Free Crypto Trading\nVoyager has revealed that it intends to offer fee-free trading for pairings of at least fifteen different cryptocurrencies on the new platform, including BTC and ETH.\nThe platform has been described as intending to “function as a sort of aggregation engine for cryptocurrency prices across more than a dozen trading venues, allowing customers to buy and sell Bitcoin and other digital assets at the best value available among them.”\nVoyager Aims to Compete with Robinhood\nVoyager seeks to compete directly with Robinhood – a popular stock trading app that hosts commission-free trading for BCH, BTC, ETH, LTC, and DOGE pairings.\nVoyager will simultaneously offer the prices available on ten virtual currency exchanges and three additional market makers, with the company hoping to entice liquidity by offering better prices to traders than any sole exchange.\nStephen Ehrlich, the CEO and co-founder of Voyager and the former CEO and founder of Lightspeed Financial, stated: “We saw an opportunity to build a dynamic smart order router that can take advantage of the marketplace and also offer customers no commissions.”\nAccording to Mr. Ehrlich, Voyager will generate revenue “by beating the average price of the coins at the point in time we execute the trade.” Mr. Ehrlich added that the company has already raised “significant capital” from the friends and family of the company’s co-founders. Oscar Salazar, the founding architect and chief technology officer of Uber, is also a co-founder of Voyager, alongside, early Uber investor, Philip Eytan.\nVoyager Licensed in Several U.S. States\nVoyager is presently entering beta testing, with the company anticipating that it will release a mobile trading app before November of this year. Currently, the platform is licensed in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, and Montana, with the company hoping to eventually service at least forty U.S. states. The company has also indicated that it intends to offer exclusive services for institutional investors.\nMr. Ehrlich concluded that he “do[es]n’t think crypto has been adopted yet by the masses in the United States,” adding “ I believe the market space itself is extremely large…We think the opportunity for both retail and institutional is vast, and we want to be part of that, and help the industry grow, and be good citizens to the industry, and help people get more knowledgeable in crypto assets.”\nDo you think that commission-free and decentralized exchanges will undermine the dominance of conventional virtual currency exchanges?

    "text": "\n Leading companies from the crypto sector in Ireland have complained they are being denied services by some of the country’s major financial institutions. Among the affected businesses are bitcoin exchange Bitcove, winner of the bank-sponsored “Best Business Startup” award, and Ireland’s “longest running” bitcoin broker, Eircoin.  \nAlso read: Swiss Crypto Company Acquires License to Distribute Funds to Investors\nBanks Close Accounts of Award-Winning Startup\nSeveral Irish businesses have been forced to either stop trading cryptocurrencies or seek partners abroad after local financial institutions refused to offer them banking services. Some of them have lost their bank accounts, while others have never been allowed to open one in the country, the local press reported.\n\nBitcoin exchange Bitcove, which has been operating since 2014 and had previously worked with Allied Irish Banks (AIB), Permanent TSB and Bank of Ireland, is one of the affected companies, The Irish Times reported. One of its co-founders, Peter Nagle, told the newspaper the banks closed its accounts stating they do not support companies offering cryptocurrency exchange facilities. The trading platform has since been using the services of “a more progressive banking partner” in Europe.\n“Particularly disappointing was Bank of Ireland. We were participants on the Ignite startup program, which is backed by the bank. Our business and its progress were reviewed monthly by a panel which included Bank of Ireland representatives. At the end of the incubator Bitcove won the award, but then just a few months later our accounts were frozen and eventually closed,” Nagle explained.\nOne of Ireland’s First Bitcoin Brokers Also Hit\nAnother crypto firm that has suffered from the clampdown is Eircoin, one of Ireland’s oldest bitcoin brokers, which closed a couple of months ago. An affiliated consulting business was also refused banking services. “We are being shuttered due to a negligent and defensive banking system,” Eircoin’s cofounder Dave Fleming said, quoted by the Irish daily. He added that his company, along with other cryptocurrency sellers, had previously consulted with the Central Bank of Ireland which told them that as long as they were abiding by the regulations their operations were in line with the law.\nBank of Ireland, one of the four largest Irish commercial banks, admitted in a statement it was not providing banking services to virtual currency exchange platforms, but noted that its customers were not prevented from transacting cryptocurrency. AIB Group, another “Big Four” bank, denied it was refusing services to companies from the crypto sector. A spokesman was quoted as saying, “We don’t discriminate in relation to providing banking services to cryptocurrency companies nor have we been systematically exiting such companies.” According to the official, some of these businesses are unable to comply with the anti-money laundering and know your customer requirements that the bank is obliged to adhere to.\nThe Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) stated that it wasn’t aware of any policy to close accounts of companies trading cryptocurrencies. However, the organization presenting 70 traditional financial institutions noted that Irish lenders are expected to take measures to minimize the risk of facilitating “financial crimes which are enabled by cryptocurrencies,” such as money laundering and terrorism financing.\nSharp Contrast\nThe negative attitude of the legacy financial institutions towards crypto businesses sharply contrasts with the view of Ireland as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction in general. Recently, it was reported that a new government-backed platform will promote the country as a hub for developers of applications based on the technology behind cryptocurrencies. Blockchain Ireland was launched by the Irish Blockchain Expert Group in partnership with a young company called Consensys. The initiative is supported by Enterprise Ireland, the Department of Finance, members of the industry and representatives of academic institutions. The agency promoting foreign investment in the country, IDA Ireland, has also backed blockchain and crypto projects.\n\nCryptocurrencies and the related economic activities received another recognition by authorities in Dublin with the decision of the Irish revenue service to issue guidelines on the taxation of crypto transactions. The new “Tax and Duty Manual” clarifies related matters and confirms that in most cases the existing tax regulations apply to the crypto sector. According to the advisory, crypto incomes and profits are subject to direct taxes such as corporate tax, income tax, and capital gains tax. Officials have also stated that for VAT purposes bitcoin constitutes a currency. The Irish tax agency regards cryptocurrencies as “negotiable instruments” and exempts them from the value added tax.\nDo you think the bank clampdown on crypto businesses in Ireland is temporary?

    "text": "\n The Financial Supervisory Commission of Taiwan has indicated its intentions to maintain only a limited oversight of cryptocurrencies. The regulator said it’s going to focus mainly on the enforcement of anti-money laundering policies, while remaining open towards innovations like those coming from the crypto sector. \nAlso read: Bitcoin Businesses Denied Banking Services in Ireland\nNot Stifling Innovation\nWith the executive power in Taipei still mulling over new regulations for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs), representatives of Taiwan’s financial regulator indicated their unwillingness to slow down progress in the fintech industry. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) will mainly focus on one of its core duties – overseeing the enforcement of anti-money laundering policies, and will continue to welcome innovations that come with digital currencies.\nDuring a press conference on Thursday, Banking Bureau Deputy Director Sherri Chuang said the FSC prefers to monitor developments and avoid stifling early-stage growth. Quoted by The Taipei Times, she emphasized:\n\nThe commission maintains an open stance and welcomes all industry innovations.\n\nChuang also noted that cryptocurrencies, and the tokens issued through ICOs, which are classified as commodities at this stage, do not currently fall under the commission’s jurisdiction. The regulator is only involved in preventing money laundering through virtual assets, the official reiterated before the media. Sherri Chuang compared the situation with that of the lease finance companies, where the involvement of the regulator is also limited to money laundering prevention.\nAccording to another representative of the commission, Securities and Futures Bureau Chief Secretary Chien Hung-ming, ICOs do not cross any regulatory red lines in Taiwan. He explained that each coin offering would be assessed on a case-by-case basis, noting that regulators are primarily concerned with examining the fundraising prospects of the respective token sale.\nThe FSC will assess each issuance to determine if the digital coin should be classified as a security or a virtual commodity, Chien added. “It is very difficult to define broadly, as each case is different,” the FSC official pointed out.\nNot Following China\nThe Executive Yuan, or the Taiwanese government, has yet to develop and adopt comprehensive regulations for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings. In April, high-ranking officials indicated that the respective legislative framework should be developed and introduced by November, 2018, as news.Bitcoin.com reported.\nAccording to a statement by Taiwan’s Justice Minister, Qiu Taisan, the government intends to task the FSC with developing the regulatory system for digital currencies. The Ministry of the Interior, the Investigation Bureau, and the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) are expected to assist the commission.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been increasingly mentioned as a subject of concern, mainly in the light of money laundering, Taiwan is not likely to severely restrict them. Last year the chairman of the FSC, Wellington Koo, confirmed that the country would not adopt a prohibitive regulatory framework like the one implemented in China.\nEarlier in April, Taiwan’s Central Bank signaled it would favor regulating cryptocurrencies under the country’s existing anti-money laundering laws. Its new governor, Yang Chin-long, suggested that the Ministry of Justice should include bitcoin in the scope of ROC’s Money Laundering Control Act.\nDo you expect Taiwan to eventually adopt crypto-friendly regulations?

    "text": "\n 2018 might not be the best year for crypto investors so far, but a lot of wealth is still in the hands of long-term holders. The latest example of this comes from Silicon Valley where some people are using bitcoin to buy millions worth of expensive timepieces, diamonds and other luxury items.\n\nAlso Read: This Week in Bitcoin: McAfee Backs Off, Crypto World Cup and the Mystery of 21e8\nCrypto Surpasses Credit Cards\n\nStephen Silver Fine Jewelry, a Silicon Valley-based ultra-high-end watches and jewelry boutique which implemented cryptocurrency payments back in 2014, reports that crypto transactions have grown to 20% of sales in the past year, helping the company close expensive sales. The company accepts payments in cryptocurrencies such as BTC, BCH and XMR, but only from authorized and approved Bitpay wallets. It started doing so as an easier and more secure alternative to wire transfers, providing much faster transfer times than the old legacy systems.\n“Cryptocurrency has surpassed the volume of retail credit-card purchases in the company in a very short time period,” CEO Stephen Silver said. “We’ve created revenue that the company would not even enjoy without being able to accept cryptocurrency…. Large sums of money are where we are finding cryptocurrency to be a huge advantage.”\nIndispensable Tool at Cradle of Innovation\nThe company has been monitoring the development of cryptocurrency for years, “Given that Stephen Silver Fine Jewelry is based in Silicon Valley, the cradle of innovation,” president Jared Silver told diamonds industry publication Rapaport News. “In 2014, we felt it had matured to the point that we could bring the technology into our store.” The company also pays its willing suppliers with cryptocurrency, however “this would be contingent on the supply chain adopting the technology,” he added.\nAt the bottom line, accepting cryptocurrencies is now an “indispensable” payment method according to the jeweler. The average crypto deal is close to seven figures, and the company can offer no limit on the amount it will accept per sale, since bitcoin transactions are irreversible unlike credit cards. The president also revealed that the company recently received a million-dollar cryptocurrency payment.\nIs bitcoin a perfect match for buying expensive luxury items?

    "text": "\n Cryptocurrency bears are still clawing away at digital asset prices on Sunday, June 24 as most of the digital currency market values are down between 3-12 percent over the last 24-hours. The top cryptocurrency market held by bitcoin core (BTC) has touched a triple bottom at $5,832 during the early morning June 24 trading sessions. The last two times BTC dropped to these price ranges was in November 2017, and last February. Some traders believe a third bottom indicates significant support and cryptocurrency prices could capitulate after breaking through resistance levels.\nAlso read: The Bitcoin-Culture Invasion: T-Shirts, Hats, Candles, Mugs, and More\nTriple Bottom Achieved: What’s Next for Crypto-Markets? \nWhen will the 2018 cryptocurrency bear market end? Will digital currency markets experience a bear run every four years? These are the questions many traders and speculators are asking as some are in desperate search for that ever elusive ‘bottom.’ Cryptocurrency market prices are pretty low today on June 24 as the entire market capitalization of all 1600+ digital assets is around $242Bn at the time of publication. \n\nAs we mentioned above the last time prices were this low was back in February of this year and November 2017. However, even though 2018 has been a rough year so far there has been a lot of new infrastructure announcements, a wide variety of investment vehicles and trading platforms, new applications, and innovation taking place on the sidelines as everyone is hypnotized by the falling prices.\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Market Action \nAt the moment bitcoin cash (BCH) markets are seeing extremely low prices not seen since last February as the price per BCH is around $683. The overall BCH market valuation has dropped to $11.8Bn losing $1.4Bn since last Friday. BCH markets are down 8.5 percent over the last 24-hours and 19 percent over the last week. BCH trade volume, although way lower than Q4 2017, is still holding steady at $458Mn or more for 24-hour volumes. The top exchanges swapping most of the bitcoin cash trading volume today include Okex, ZB.com, Bitfinex, Huobi, and EXX. The top currency traded with BCH today is BTC by 46.2 percent which is followed by tether (USDT 23.8%), USD (18.7%), KRW (4.4%), and the EUR (1.5%).\n\nBCH/USD Technical Indicators\nLooking at the 30-minute and 4-hour charts for BCH/USD on Bitfinex and Bitstamp shows a small recovery is taking place since the initial drop this morning. The two Simple Moving Averages to watch (100 SMA & 200 SMA) still have a decent gap with the long-term 200 SMA above the short term 100 trendline. This indicates a move to the downside could take place again in the near future. MACd and RSI levels (44) are heading northbound after showing oversold conditions which also shows BCH bulls are trying to fight back. Despite the fact that a psychological price barrier was broken the market is showing strong foundations. Looking above at sell walls BCH bulls need to break through $750 and $800 to show some comeback strength. Below that, if bears remain in charge they will be stopped by significant buy walls at the current vantage point until just before $600.\n\nBitcoin Core (BTC) Market Action \nBitcoin core (BTC) markets are seeing an average spot price of around $5,858 at press time with $3.6Bn in 24-hour trade volume. BTC volume is lower than last Friday as trade volume has dipped around $625Mn since before the weekend. Even though BTC prices have been dropping, market dominance amongst all the other cryptocurrency markets is increasing slowly and hovers at 41 percent today. The top trading platforms exchanging the most BTC today are Binance, Bitfinex, Okex, Coinbene, and Huobi. The Japanese yen according to the data site Crypto Compare is grasping over 69 percent of today’s BTC trades. This is followed by the USD (13.4%), tether (USDT 12.8%), EUR (1.8%), and the KRW (1.3%)\n\nBTC/USD Technical Indicators\nLooking at charts for BTC/USD on Coinbase and Bitstamp shows some triangular action and some deep consolidation. Bollinger bands are extremely tight as we enter the triple bottom region. The two SMA trendlines are similar to BCH/USD charts with the long-term 200 SMA above the short term 100 SMA. This means the bearish sentiment is not over and could likely continue after a small price reprisal in the short term. MACd and RSI levels (26) are also starting to move northbound after signs of oversold conditions. BTC bulls need to muster up the strength to surpass hefty resistance levels from the current vantage point up until $6300 to make better progress. On the backside, bears will see strong foundations between now and $5100 which could last a for some time.\n\nThe Top Cryptocurrency Markets Are Feeling the Pain Especially EOS\nOverall most digital assets today are hurting and are nurturing wounds as bears have scarred markets pretty badly since the beginning of the year. The second largest market capitalization belonging to ethereum (ETH) markets is down 7.4 percent this Sunday. Over the last seven days, ETH has lost 13.2 percent and the price per ETH is around $435 per coin. Ripple (XRP) markets are hovering around $0.45 cents per XRP as markets have lost 6 percent over the last 24-hours. Lastly, the fifth highest valued cryptocurrency market commanded by EOS has lost 12.9 percent over the last 24-hours and a harsh 31 percent during the last seven days. One EOS is trading for $7.22 per coin when last Friday it traded for $8.60 per EOS. \n\nThe Verdict: Triple Bottom Tea Leaves Add Some Positivity, but Skepticism Remains Strong \nAs we stated above many are in search of the elusive bottom when it comes to this crypto-bear market in 2018. Skepticism and mass speculation is taking place amongst traders as the triple bottom has everyone wondering if we will now see a trend reversal. \n\nWe don’t know if a reversal will take place even if the triple bottom was achieved as some traders believe we still have more drops ahead. The verdict today remains the same as our last markets update which stated “skepticism remains strong,” and in fact, there may be even more skeptical people after this weekend’s significant dip.\nWhere do you see the price of BCH, BTC, and other coins headed from here?

    "text": "\n Over the past month or so since the most recent Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network upgrade, a lot of developers have created platforms and extensions that utilize the re-enabled Satoshi OP_Codes and updated OP_Return transactions. There’s been a bunch of social media applications like Memo and Blockpress that allow users to submit data that’s tied to the BCH protocol in an on-chain fashion. Now there’s an application that combines all of the data sent on-chain through a platform called Chainfeed — A tool that displays a global real-time news feed powered by bitcoin cash.\nAlso read: A Character Called Bitpico Thinks He Can Stress-Test the BCH Network\nThree Apps That Showcase the Bitcoin Cash Network’s OP_Return Innovation \n@_Unwriter\nOver the past few weeks since the successful Bitcoin Cash network upgrade this past May lots of BCH supporters have been experimenting with the new OP_Codes and OP_Return transactions. Immediately after the fork, platforms like Memo.cash, and Blockpress also upgraded their software which allowed users more characters per written post. With all the OP_Return innovation taking place a developer called ‘Unwriter’ has created three platform extensions called Chainfeed, the _opreturn Twitter bot, and read.cash. The applications work with programs like Memo.cash, while also using the Twitter API as well.\nChainfeed: A Global Real-Time News Feed Powered by BCH OP_Return Transactions  \nChainfeed is a global newsfeed that shows all the messages being created on the Bitcoin Cash network in real-time. Basically, the tool logs all the OP_Return transactions on the BCH chain and delivers the data to users on the client side. Scrolling through the app’s interface shows all the OP_Return transactions taking place right now and a portion of the feed is a bunch of gibberish. However, users can filter the platform’s query so it only finds OP_Return transactions tied to specific applications like Blockpress. Chainfeed’s data site and the info shown can be shared with direct links alongside the ability to be bookmarked as well.   \n“There are currently two tabs: ‘all’ and ‘featured apps.’ ‘All’ is the raw OP_Return feed,” explains the Chainfeed creator. \n\n‘Featured Apps’ is for applications that have their own overlay application protocols (such as memo.cash or blockpress so far). It’s still early days so there aren’t many apps that make use of the OP_Return data transaction feature yet, but we will probably see a lot of exciting apps soon.\n\nChainfeed API. \nThe Twitter Bot ‘_Opreturn’ Turns Twitter Into an Application-Specific Bitcoin Sidechain \nThe developer has also created a Twitter bot called @_Opreturn which is a program that uses the Chainfeed firehouse API to monitor real-time messages sent on the BCH chain. Then the messages are replicated onto Twitter using the Twitter API. Visiting the bot’s Twitter page shows the application is quite active as it posts BCH-powered OP_Return transaction and streams them into _Opreturn’s Twitter feed. So far since Unwriter launched the bot the platform has tweeted 3,322 times and a good majority of the posts stem from the Memo.cash application.\n“We’re turning Twitter into an application-specific Bitcoin sidechain,” explains Unwriter.\n@_Opreturn\nWatch All of Those Bitcoin Cash Social Media Accounts With Read.cash\nLastly, the developer Unwriter has created another BCH application called read.cash. In essence, read.cash takes all your BCH-centric social media accounts from Yours.org, Blockpress, and Memo and creates a platform that allows the owner to manage all of the tethered BCH wallets in one place. Read.cash enables users to add wallets using public keys instead of private keys. Creates a watchlist for all of the accounts’ wallets so people can view their accounts’ actions and most importantly the funds stored on these websites. Moreover, users have the ability to recharge application wallets using QR codes and the Moneybutton application.\nRead.cash\nAll of Unwriters platforms are open source and the codebase and descriptions can be viewed at the developer’s Github repository. The applications Unwriter has created just scratches the surface when it comes to the potential of these censorship resistant social media platforms and the extensions that have followed. Ever since the re-enabled OP_Codes and the increased OP_Return data, it has caused a tidal wave of platforms that showcase innovation like the apps mentioned above and other realized concepts like trustless betting, auctions, and dice rolls. \nWhat do you think about the platforms and extensions Unwriter has built on top of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain?

    "title": " Initial Coin Offerings in the first half of 2018 have attracted nearly double the amount of funds raised last",
    "text": "\n Initial Coin Offerings in the first half of 2018 have attracted nearly double the amount of funds raised last year, a new report reveals. Researchers point out, however, that the majority of ICOs have largely failed, with only a third of the projects closed successfully. According to the study, the US remains the major destination for coin offerings while Switzerland has established itself as a European ‘standard bearer’ in regulation.  \nAlso read: Why 70% of ICO Tokens Are Not Exchange Listed and Probably Never Will Be\n$13.7 Billion Raised in Coin Offerings This Year\nThe capital raised through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) has reached $13.7 billion USD in the first five months of this year, twice the total for the whole of 2017. The data comes from a newly released report authored by the Swiss Crypto Valley Association (CVA) and Strategy&, the consulting division of one of its members, PwC. The study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the global ICO activity and explore key changes in the space since last year.\nThe numbers in the second edition of the quarterly Global ICO Report are in sharp contrast with this year’s bearish trend that has taken over crypto markets. According to Daniel Diemers, Head of Blockchain EMEA at PwC Strategy&, the report “highlights the continued growth and popularity of ICOs globally in 2018, with over 537 ICOs conducted in the first five months of this year, raising a combined total of $13.7 billion USD – more than all ICOs which took place before 2018 combined.” According to data quoted by Reuters, around $7.0 billion have been raised by token sales last year. Daniel Diemers also said:\n\nAfter all the hype of 2017, this year has seen the ICO sector becoming more mature and established, with an improved focus on best business and legal practice, investor relations and fundraising. Hybrid models of combined Venture Capital and ICO financing are increasingly bringing together the best of what both have to offer, so that the soundness of a business is validated while it realizes its market potential by receiving crowd support.\n\nHowever, the paper also notes that the majority of crowdfunding projects have failed to achieve their goals. Only about 30 percent of the 3,470 ICOs announced since 2013, the report details, have closed successfully, while many have been delayed or lost momentum during the token sale process.\nAmerica a Major ICO Destination, Switzerland a Leader in Regulation\nAccording to the research, the US remains a major destination for Initial Coin Offerings. In the first five months of the year, 56 US-registered token sales have raised a total of $1.1 billion USD. The authors believe this is due to the clear and firm regulatory requirements put in place there and the growing number of crowdfunding projects that choose to register with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They also point to an increase in the number of coin offerings conducted in the United Kingdom as well as the volume of capital raised there. According to the provided statistics, 48 UK-registered ICO projects have attracted more than $500 million in 2018.\nAnother conclusion is that Switzerland has affirmed itself as a leading hub for ICO and blockchain business in Europe and remains attractive to crypto entrepreneurs, while smaller jurisdictions like Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and Malta are following in its footsteps. “Switzerland is the standard bearer in terms of establishing a regulatory environment for the digital economy. The Crypto Valley in Switzerland offers a unique environment that embraces blockchain technologies and the potential of ICOs while always embodying Swiss values, such as privacy protection and confidentiality,” said Oliver Bussmann, President of the Crypto Valley Association.\nICO Destinations and Trends\nThe findings confirm some previous observations and detect new trends regarding Initial Coin Offerings. According to an earlier report, covering 370 ICOs, US-based crowdfunding projects have raised $1.03 billion – so no surprise there. The study placed China (including Hong Kong) second with $452 million, followed by Russia with $310 million USD. What’s surprising is the development of the ICO market in the UK, where financial authorities and regulators have generally demonstrated lukewarm attitude towards cryptocurrencies and the crypto space.\nSwitzerland, whose crypto-friendly jurisdiction has attracted a number of crypto and blockchain businesses, is trying hard to catch up with the leading ICO destinations. Representatives of the country’s crypto community have joined a multinational effort to challenge the ban on crypto-related advertisements imposed by the largest IT corporations. The restrictions introduced by companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, hit hard crowdfunding projects and are likely to be targeted soon in a class action lawsuit.\nAt the same time, the achievements of far less conspicuous European countries have made the headlines of ICO-related articles and publications. Lithuania is a good example – the tiny Baltic state has reportedly attracted around 10 percent of all coin offerings last year. An estimated €500 million has been raised through ICOs and blockchain projects over the last 12 months. Authorities in Vilnius have recently issued comprehensive regulatory guidelines for initial coin offerings. According to a recent report by Politico, the country’s economy is expected to grow by more than 3 percent this year and the digital cash flow is part of the reasons.\nDo you expect the ICO sector to grow, despite the continuing downward trend on crypto markets?

    "text": "\n Institutional money is coming. At least that’s been the refrain from desperate cryptocurrency traders for the past six months, praying for an influx of new fiat to shore up prices and float their alt bags. But is it really the case that institutional investors are waiting on the sidelines for the right framework to buy in? At Blockchain Expo in Amsterdam last week, news.bitcoin.com spoke to two exchange leaders who are confident that it’s a question of when, not if, institutional investors pile in.\nAlso read: Shapeshift CEO Defeats Peter Schiff in Bitcoin Debate\nInstitutional Money Is Coming but Will It Benefit Retail Investors?\nCrypto assets surged by an average of 11.4% on Monday, with bitcoin, predictably, the first to pop. The reason for the pump has been attributed to Coinbase announcing that its custodial crypto service was finally live. The service includes cold storage, an institutional-grade broker-dealer and reporting services, and a client coverage program, and Coinbase is in the process of onboarding hedge funds. But beyond the news fleetingly giving the markets an adrenaline shot, what will the long-term ramifications be of institutional money pouring in, and what’s taken so long?\n\nKimley Kadoche is the Head of Investor Relations at LGO, which is poised to launch as an institutional-friendly exchange capable of handling large fiat transactions, and Nick Cowan is the CEO of Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX). It’s aiming to become an institutional-grade token sale platform and digital asset exchange, and is onboarding its existing Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX) clients. Both individuals are naturally bullish on the prospects of institutional money entering the crypto market, but have their reasons for being so optimistic, having liaised with many of the big spenders pondering a move.\nStep 1: Regulation\nIt’s no secret that one of the impediments to institutional investors entering the crypto space is the need for a suitable regulatory framework; hedge funds can’t simply invest their clients’ funds in the same free-and-easy manner as a retail investor. “[GBX] fundamentally believe that the technology is here to stay,” begins Nick Cowan, on bitcoin. “We fundamentally believe in adoption…particularly institutional, but what will accelerate that, I think, is the implementation of certain regulations: consumer confidence, investor protection, transparency, and those sorts of issues, which, at the moment, have been holding back a number of major players who might come into this market.”\n“In the US there is an appetite [among institutional investors],” says Kimley, “but for now they’re just waiting for something more concrete that offers a real solution. And most important that is SEC and FINRA compliant, because that’s the main issue, is you need to be able to report your crypto trading on the books”.\nStep 2: Security\nLGO’s Kimley Kadoche\nKimley Kadoche asserts that institutional investors have a “big appetite” for the crypto market, but require a “safe structure that offers them a solution” including custodial services. For such investors, “the infrastructure that you have right now on the market is not super safe. There’s always an issue with the custodian, KYC procedures are not very safe, and also we’re waiting for the SEC to be fully transparent on what regulation and actions they want to take regarding digital assets”.\nNick is also confident that there is “institutional money waiting on the sidelines” but believes “there are concerns about not just the asset, it’s the custody of these things that has to be addressed for institutions to be able to say, ‘Okay, now we are happy and can come in’”. The approach that Coinbase has taken to custodial security is to provide cold storage of broker funds. LGO is taking a different approach and providing decentralized storage, integrated with Ledger, combined with a centralized order book.\nStep 3: Liquidity\nBecause institutional traders are typically going to be buying big, liquidity is a key problem that needs to be solved. Leading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum are much more liquid than in the industry’s earliest days, but a single large order can still move the entire market. “The third [problem that must be solved] is the liquidity,” acknowledges Kimley. “Financial institutions are going to be buying and selling big quantities and they need to have a seller or buyer of them to face them. So you need to be able to provide them what they want. You can’t just go on Coinbase and buy 1,000 bitcoin. Right now, there’s a latency problem and slippage.”\nStep 4: Moon?\nNick Cowan\nLGO’s Kimley Kadoche and GBX’s Nick Cowan sensibly wouldn’t be drawn on whether a flood of institutional money would send bitcoin on another moon mission, but acknowledged that its presence can only be a good thing for the crypto economy. Kimley believes it is “going to improve the trust in the market” while Nick asserts: “I think the long term view is that [institutional] adoption will take place, leading to more people getting involved, and that can only be a good thing”.\nInstitutional money isn’t going to save bitcoin, buy retail investors’ alt bags or spearhead a 1,000-year bull run. But it will certainly add legitimacy to the markets and in the process bring bitcoin, as both an investment vehicle and a device for financial empowerment, to a currently underserved and influential segment of the population. And that can only be a good thing.\nDo you think the arrival of institutional money will have a positive effect on the cryptocurrency markets? Let us know in the comments section below.
